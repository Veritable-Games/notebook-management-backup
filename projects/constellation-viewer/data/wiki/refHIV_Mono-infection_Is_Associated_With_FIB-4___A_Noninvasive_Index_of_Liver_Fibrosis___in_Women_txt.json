However, it is invasive and associated with complications, sampling error, and variability in interpretation, and it is not routinely performed in uninfected, healthy persons or in persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) mono-infection. Moreover, patients may be reluctant to undergo multiple liver biopsies to accurately monitor their disease progression. Consequently, serum biochemical markers have been evaluated as alternative measures of liver damage (reviewed in [1]).\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/refHIV_Mono-infection_Is_Associated_With_FIB-4_–_A_Noninvasive_Index_of_Liver_Fibrosis_–_in_Women.txt.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.184Z",

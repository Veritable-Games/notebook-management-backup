Claim the solitary parachute hurtling towards the ground at terminal velocity and\nearn your freedom!\nDevelopment Goals\nCraft a competitive, unique racing game akin to the Mario Kart franchise with mature themes.\nLet players unlock cosmetics by playing the game instead of submitting to RNG slot machines.\nNo rubberbanding! Skill-based racing experience with a balanced set of catch-up mechanics.\nPlayer Mechanics\nControls\nDive – RT or RMB to dive, letting go will put the player in free fall pose and slow them down. Arm\nboosters power the acceleration\nDash – Tapping the A button while leaning the left analog stick will let the player dash in that direction\nusing the suit's boosters. If the player presses A without leaning the analog stick, they will dash\ndownward, this is great for breaking obstacles quickly at a minor cost to health.\nBrace – Holding/Tapping the X button will make the player character Brace for impact. Doing this will\nalways mitigate damage and prevent Stun but it will also slow the player's Velocity.\nBash – When an enemy is near, locking on to them with LT and pressing the A button will let you Bash\nthem away. (Locking function makes this mechanic more accessible in a 3D space) They can react to this\nby Bracing before impact, or avoid the attack by Dashing away.Variables\nHealth – Visually represented by diegetic HUD, health takes the form of suit damage, injuries to the\nplayer character, changes to animation, and audio cues like coarse breathing.\nStun – Some obstacles and items will Stun the player. This effect reduces the overall control of their\nNoxii and will slow their Velocity but it won't incur any damage penalty.\nVelocity – The speed at which the player is falling. This variable is affected by wind resistance (really just\nreduced maximum speed) and whatever booster type the player is using.\nDeath – If a player loses all their health, they're treated to a wonderfully violent die-o-rama animation\nthat shows them dying to whatever took the last bit of HP. Player will respawn as a spectator bot that\nhas a full range of motion in any direction they like and Coin is still earned.\nEquipment Pickups\nAll items can be acquired by hitting marked targets during the descent. The items given have different\nodds depending on a player's health, position, and distance from the goal. Items are deployed and\nattached to players via drones and are visually represented on the player's suit.\n*Drop percentages and statistical effects of equipment should be determined via playtesting.\nOffense Items\nRocket – A projectile that is thrown downward. If a Rocket hits a player, it will stun them and slow them\ndown. Rockets can be avoided with a well-timed spin and they come in 1, 2, or 3s.\nMissile – A single-use tracking projectile that locks onto the player ahead of the one using it and sends\nthem into a Spiral if it hits. Missiles can be avoided with a well-timed Spin\nSaboteur – The most powerful projectile in the game. Saboteur Drones will target any player in first,\nsecond, or third place and will avoid all obstacles along its immediate path. They can be devastating\nwhen used and have a small counter window.\nDefense Items\nBuddy – This rare item will automatically deflect or destroy incoming projectiles. It lasts for 10 seconds\nand can defend against as many attacks as needed in that time. It looks like a tiny robot that yells and\ncheers every time it fends off attacks.\nMender – A drone with a limited healing ability. It can seal small wounds, repair the player's suit, and\ncauterize serious injuries. Common drop, does not appear if player is undamaged.\nRed Mender – A special variant of the Mender drone that will actively seek out and fully heal any player\nthat needs health, but take away weapons if they accept its help. It will appear once for every player in\nin the level but can be used multiple times by different people.\nWard – This trap will knock back anyone that goes near it with a quick, but powerful burst of\ncompressed gas, stunning them momentarily and slowing their Velocity. Common item.Speed Items\nRefined Fuel – An item that gives players a short, controlled burst of speed when used. It can be found\nin drops of one, two, or three. Using all three in succession will result in burn out of the arm boosters\nand a huge cost to the player's speed.\nFaulty Jetpack – A recovery Item that gives a huge speed boost and invulnerability to players that are\nfalling behind. The farther away a player is from the leader, the higher their chances of getting the item.\nFaulty Jetpacks can bolster a player's normal bash attack, knocking them into a violent spin and\npotentially killing them if they hit an object. These items are also rigged to explode after they reach a\ncertain position in the race or used for X amount of time. Timer is represented by a beeping noise.\nPlayer needs to throw the backpack to get rid of it before it explodes or they incur a death penalty.\nJetpacks can be thrown to stun opponents, and if timed right, kill them. It's this same system that can be\nused to forfeit a parachute.\nLevel Design\nLevels are downward facing cylindrical tunnels that span several miles. Choose from 16 maps that have a\nwide range of environments, obstacles, hazards, traps, and modifiers. The maps can greatly affect\nnormal gameplay variables and influence player strategies as a result.\nLevel List\nCapital – Largest city on the planet; incredibly dense, and difficult to navigate due to traffic.\nFactory – This is where the Capital's military Droids are manufactured. Very dangerous.\nGarden – Sparsely planted agriculture for a struggling civilization. Largest map in the game.\nRemnant – An abandoned city mostly devoid of life; extremely hazardous, average depth.\nLevel Systems\nDropship – Every participant in the match starts from the Dropship. It hovers above the chasm below\nand launches the booster propelled parachute seconds before everyone dives after it.\nStadium – This is the landing zone for victors and the impact point for those that failed. Here, the\nscoreboard is shown, earned Coin is added up, and the crowd cheers with excitement.\nLevel Objects\nAir Current – When the player passes over this object, they’ll get a permanent boost in speed until\nthey’re interrupted by an item, obstacle, or another player. The speed gained can stack with multiple\ncurrents but will fall off when the player is no longer in contact with the item.\nWall – Surface texture doesn't convey danger, contact with walls will only stun players.\nJagged Wall – Visually rough and designed to convey danger. Usually placed in tight spaces or used to\nredirect the player, these walls will stun and lightly damage players.Grabber – Arm-like machines that will snatch up a player mid-drop and redirect their them; often\nopening up new paths and sometimes right into obstacles or hazards.\nNav Drone – Drone that will hover into a player's sight when the 'view' button is pressed. It displays\neveryone's position and gives a basic glimpse at their score so far. It will hover away after a few seconds\nand can also be destroyed by environmental hazards in the descent.\nAnnouncer\nDeath Dive games are hosted by an announcer. He'll appear on a hovering display similar to the Nav\nDrone and is the only character that reveals their face. He has a slightly-off color nose and fingers that\nare shown to be prosthetics; the consequences of untreated deep frostbite.\nRendering\nLevels are separated by various types of entrances that serve as loading areas to keep the performane in\ncheck and rendering cost low. Doors, smaller tunnels, large obstacles, etc.\nUnlock Systems\nRewards\nCoin [¢] – A Noxii's reward for participating in the competition. It can be traded for cosmetics,\nmodifications that affect their maximum velocity or defense, and at a high cost, freedom.\nAcclaims – Bonuses for performing certain actions during a match. The end-game screen will display\ntotal earnings, how they were obtained, and then add them to the player's total Coin.\n- Champion: 1500¢ - Reached the finish line and survived the landing.\n- Challenger: 500¢ - Made it to the finish line but didn't survive the landing.\n- Contestant: 150¢ - Died during the match and didn't make it to the finish alive\n- Executioner: 50¢ - Killed a player or AI during a match, this stacks up to 11 for 550c\n- Operator: 25¢ - Used equipment, this can be done as many times as available on a map.\n- Attacker: 5¢ - Damaged an enemy by any means, this can be stacked ad infinitum.\nRed Coin – Noxii usually only rewarded for being aggressive and competitive. So if a player were to\nforfeit the option to attack when given the chance, they don't earn any coin for it at the end of a match.\nHowever, if this happens, Red Coin is granted to them without any sort of explaination. Narratively, this\nis the currency of a separatist faction and it can be used to buy additional parachutes for a single red\ncoin each or a special re-usable mender drone for 50¢.\nCosmetics\nPlayers can obtain cosmetics with Coin by playing the game and earning Acclaims. Each of the items is\navailable for purchase as soon as the player has enough Coin to buy them. Prices will range from 500¢\nto 10,000¢. Item categories include Head, Torso, Arms, Legs, and Colors.Gameplay Loop\nMain menu > Dive > Loading mini-game > Cinematic overview of map, its obstacles, and a few of the\npotential paths to take > Camera switches to view of the vehicle hovering above the chasm and its doors\nopen to reveal the players and bots huddled within > camera view swaps to the third person perspective\nof the controlling player > countdown begins right as the parachute is thrown; it has a jetpack attached,\n5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and everyone manually jumps > music begins and the tension builds as players reach the\nedge of this immense chasm > using abilities and avoiding obstacles, players fight, struggle, and die for\nthe next 4 to 7 minutes in an effort to reach the parachute first > at the finish line, the parachute stops\nspeeding and players have a chance to reach it > match ends with the losing players hitting the ground\nwith a lethal impact, and if someone grabbed the parachute, they float to the bottom in whatever\nphysical state they ended in > every player is rewarded currency based on performance >players are\ntaken back to the lobby; here they can use this earned currency to buy cosmetics.\nNarrative\nSetting\nThe Noxii are criminals condemned to death by the Capital. A civilization on the frigid planet, Demeter.\nThey've been offered a chance to free themselves through the Capital's Death Dive games and few are\nreluctant to try. Only one of twelve Noxii will survive these lethal games.\nDeath Dive games take place within the immense chasms this civilization uses as habitats to insulate\nthemselves from the harsh winter above the planet's surface. Every subsurface city has been\ntemporarily fitted with obstacles, environmental hazards, and equipment drops for participants to use.\nVictors will be greeted by an audience of millions waiting for them deep beneath the surface at the end\nof the level. Living spaces for Noxii are cramped and dingy.\nDemeter is frozen, but cities are varied in design and function so level design isn't limited too much. Just\nabove the atmosphere lies the remains of a ring world that looks to have crashed into the planet's\nsurface some time ago. This is a small hint towards future potential projects.\nInhabitants of this ice world will usually have prosthetic fingers, noses, and toes due to the effects of\nfrostbite. The announcer character makes this particularly apparent in his design.\nBackstory\nCamera fades in focused on a figure wearing some form of flight helmet and a tattered suit that looks\nlike something an astronaut might wear. Red lights fill the cramped space, and you can see the outlines\nof people with similar gear. The room they're in shakes and people try to maintain balance. A faint hum\nis heard and light slowly flills the room, reflecting off the visor of the main character and those behind\nthem. People shiver as a gust of wind rolls in and snow flicks into the crowded room. Standing in the\nrear, there are lanky machines that carry weapons. The camera pans out to reveal that all of these\npeople are occupying a quadcopter-like vehicle, and just below it is an enormous, dark chasm that go\nbeneath the snowy planet's surface. A loudspeaker blares, and the announcer speaks in a foreign\ntongue. One of the tall machines steps forward and throws a backpack-like item into the abyss. It\nsuddenly lights up and propels itself downward; people murmur and moan, the main character isanxious. DING, DING, DING! People leap out of the vehicle screaming and howling, the character is\nshoved from the vehicle and plummets into the chasm. All around them, others ignite boosters that are\nrigged to their arms, accelerating their descent. Some try to fly up, but there isn't enough thrust to\nescape gravity. The main character fiddles with a device in their hand and their own boosters spark to\nlife. Everyone is now diving into the deep abyss; those furthest ahead have their arms outstretched,\ngrasping to reach the item as as explosives, rockets, and traps go off.\nDevelopment Timeline\n•Learn how to animate and potentially model in Maya\n•Offer contract work; earn a rapport & gain experience\n•-- This will take time.

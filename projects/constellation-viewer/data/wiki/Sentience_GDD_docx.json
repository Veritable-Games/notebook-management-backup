The player is immediately launched into the game world without any delay. They are standing in a white room, surreal in appearance, three tall chambers rise in front of the player’s perspective, they are labeled, Homo Sapiens, Homo Evolutis, and Homo Futurus. Densely fogged in a red mist, they gradually reveal three embryos, very similar in appearance. A moment passes and they abruptly grow at a steady pace till reaching young adult-hood and come to a gradual halt. \n\nEach looks very dissimilar from one another now that they have grown; the background fades, emphasizing focus on the three organisms. The camera moves closer. Moving the mouse over one of the chambers will brighten the liquid within and also enables the alteration dynamic, press the left and right arrow keys to scroll through the given universal colors (alters chamber liquid color), press space bar to change the organisms gender (default female), and press the up and down arrow keys to adjust the melanin levels (This feature is disabled for Futurus).\n\nThe next instances are all explained in the narrative documents.\n\n--------------------\nGame Flow\n--------------------\nSize 2\nSize 3\nSize 4\n\n--------------------\nGame Goals\n--------------------\nSize 2\nSize 3\nSize 4\n\n--------------------\nGame Modes\n--------------------\n\nSingle Player\nThe single player experience is designed for immersion in the world; full attention can be diverted towards individual character development and the narrative. Item unlocks, clearance level, and customizations are synced with online information.\n\nNarrative\nSize 4\n\nMissions\nSize 4\n\nTraining\nSize 4\n\nMulti Player\nThe multi-player experience is designed for cooperative gameplay; it relies heavily on procedural generation and collective exploration of the expansive world. Item unlocks, clearance level, and customizations are synced with offline information. \n\nMissions\nSize 4\n\nTraining\nSize 4\n\n--------------------\nTraining Scenarios\n--------------------\n\nSize 2\nProcedural Generation against robot AI\n\nThese facilities can be accessed using a seemingly obscured entrance that leads beneath the nano shelter. The subversive facility procedurally generates a combat environ that adheres to your combat style and warfare consignment. It adapts continually as your progress, targeting to improve reaction time, teamwork abilities, accuracy, and strategic thinking.\n\nSuppression\nPlayers begin at one of the two re-gen points. Rush to the neutral zone and initiate combat. Push back the opposing force to gain control of zones. When all zones are controlled victory is achieved. Players have three re-gens per zone, character death results in re-gen, NPC’s will relay strategies and orders. Cities will vary in size throughout the game. The weather, time of day,  and season will alter the combat experience drastically.\n\nResistance \nFight hundreds of enemy soldiers at the center of the city, and defend the civilians at all costs! The maximum number of players fights alongside one another against endless waves of intelligent AI with varying enemy numbers and levels of cover. Each player is given a maximum of three re-gens every five minutes, they are not accumulative. Cities will vary in size throughout the game. The weather, time of day, and season will alter the combat experience drastically. \n\n--------------------\nAI Unit Classes\n--------------------\n\nUnit Types\nThe unit classification applies only to the artificial intelligence enemies and allies of the game. \n\nPawn\nEquipped with short rifles as a primary weapon and precise shots as a secondary, these more common infantry are feeble as individual units but retain high strength in numbers. The more of these soldiers in an area, the more likely they are to overwhelm opponents with sheer firepower. They will be found in squads comprised of sixteen units, multiple squads may be present resulting in thirty-two or sixty-four total units.\n\nKnight\nStandard knight classes are equipped with medium rifle weaponry, granting them the most balanced range and power of other classes.\nThey will be found in squads comprised of eight units, multiple squads may be present resulting in sixteen or in rare cases, thirty-two sum units.\n\nRook\nTrained for close range encounters, the Rook excels in the use of Erratic Shot weaponry. Found positioned within small structures or enclosed environments, they utilize short distances to their advantage.  If an opponent takes the full impact of their primary weaponry, survival is slim. \nThey will be found in squads normally comprised of four units, multiple squads may be present resulting in eight or in rare cases, sixteen units.\n\nBishop\nProficient in long range combat, these units are equipped with Long Rifle weaponry. If unnoticed, these sharpshooters can be devastating to a player’s squad. They will engage targets from a substantial distance and are known to retreat once the opposing force has advanced too closely.\nThey will be found in squads comprised of two units, multiple squads may be present resulting in four or in rather rare cases, eight total units.\n\nQueen\nThese units are to be engaged with extreme caution as they can be equipped with a wide array of weaponry and defensive gear. It requires an extreme amount of resources to maintain mobility and effective weapon discharging, acting as an advanced form of enemy unit class.\nThey will be found as a solitary unit; no other Queens in the vicinity, with other less powerful unit types to assist them during combat.\n\nKing\nSize 4\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------\nPersonal Shelter\n--------------------\n\nFunctionality\nThe personal shelter is found in each of the game’s three narrative branches. It’s designed for the player to utilize during offline and online gameplay. Variants of the shelter retain an aesthetic that adheres to a species’ technologies. It provides the player with a number of technological apparatuses for an expansive personalize experience, a shelter that grows as the game does.\nIt retains any previously acquired entities such as armor, firearms, apparel, collectibles, and unlocks for each of the species. \n\nCustomization\nTools provided in the confines of the shelter permit the player to customize their character’s appearance to their liking, modify firearms to adhere to specific combat styles, arrange entities around the shelter, and setup their desired warfare consignment.\n\nConstruction\nWith the use of their species’ available technology, the player can construct any desired entity within the shelter, provided that the designs and requisite physical resources are acquired in advance. These resources can be attained via collection outside the cities or via the deconstruction of existing entities. Each species has a unique technique to build or deconstruct specific entities.\n\n--------------------\nPersonal Armor \n--------------------\n\nFunctionality\nPersonal Armor acts as a means of defense for each of the species, each utilizing their own available technology to design and produce it for use in a given combat scenario. Individuals using the issued personal armor have a default defense rate of 10,000. This defense rating is established differently for the species. Sapiens have a comprehensive armor with their gear, Futurus have a divided armor rating across their five armor apertures, and the Evolutis\n\nSapiens Variant \nThis armor type is essentially nanobot enhanced gear that the player utilizes to prevent physical damage. It is sustained by a restricted energy source that lessens upon high velocity collisions and regenerates when in contact with various direct or indirect light sources. The issued Nanobot Enhanced Armor has a default power capacity of 100,000 kW and weighs 100 kg.  Other armor sets can be acquired as the player obtains gradually higher clearance levels, each of which differ in statistics.\n\nEnergy Decrease\nThe loss of energy is entirely dependent on the velocity, weight, and collision point of the projectile or entity. The total energy loss isn’t precise in sum and fluctuates; when power is null, the next collision sustained will eradicate or heavily injure the user. The player can combat with it after full power loss and even has the option to customize the warfare consignment devoid of it, utilizing only the bio-resistant body suit.\n\nSolar Power Loss Rates\nNote: \"kW\" = \"kilowatts\"\n\t* ES Rounds - [-1,000 kW] (per slug)\n\t* PS Rounds - [-2,000 kW]\n\t* SR Rounds - [-4,000 kW]\n\t* MR Rounds - [-6,000 kW]\n\t* LR Rounds - [-10,000 kW]\n\nEnergy Renewal\nThe gain of energy is completely dependent on the intensity of light absorbed by the armor’s photovoltaic cells; a luminous position will renew energy more rapidly than an area with lesser light intensity. Natural light is far more potent than artificial or reflected light, resulting in unpredictable scenario intensities for times of day, weather patterns, and environmental conditions that are procedurally generated.\n\nSolar Radiation Levels\nNote: \"kWm\" = \"kilowatts per minute\"\n\t* Moon, Clear Sky - [1.0 kWm]\n\t* Moon, Overcast - [0.5 kWm]\n\t* Stars, Clear Sky - [0.002 kWm]\n\t* Stars, Overcast - [0.001 kWm]\n\t* Sun, Clear Sky - [30,000 kWm] \n\t* Sun, Overcast - [10,000 kWm]\n\t* Artificial Light - [100 kWm]\n\t* Camp Fire Light - [50 kWm]\n\nFuturus Variant \nThis cumbersome armor type is designed to mitigate damage sustained by various caliber types for a limited number of direct collisions. It’s known to be rather unreliable to protect the soldier at a consistent or predicable rate. Multiple shots will reduce the material’s resistance gradually, ultimately making the user entirely vulnerable to successive fire power during combat. Due to inadequate resources, the higher quality armor sets are granted to those of higher ranking within the Futurus military forces. \n\nMaterial Loss\nThe loss of material is entirely dependent on the velocity, weight, and collision point of the projectile or entity. The total energy loss isn’t precise in sum and fluctuates; when density is null, the next collision sustained will eradicate or heavily injure the user. They can combat with it after substantial material loss and even have the option to customize the warfare consignment devoid of it, utilizing only casual apparel.\n\nDefense Capabilities\nNote: \"dM\" = \"defense material\"\n\t* ES Rounds - [-1,000 dM] (per slug)\n\t* PS Rounds - [-2,000 dM]\n\t* SR Rounds - [-4,000 dM]\n\t* MR Rounds - [-6,000 dM]\n\t* LR Rounds - [-10,000 dM]\n\nMaterial Gain\nThe only method to restore the damaged material is through the physical replacement of armor plating. In combat the taught survival strategy is to obtain the material from incapacitated allies. Intentionally designed for this very purpose, the armor sets have interchangeable plating apertures which can be quickly accessed for replacement. Futurus soldiers are taught and expected to perform this practice to survive. \n\nDefense Apertures\nNote: \"damaged material cannot be picked up” \n\t* Helmet\n\t* Upper Torso\n\t* Lower Torso\n\t* Upper Limbs\n\t* Lower Limbs\n\nEvolutis Variant \nUnknown\n\n--------------------\nCombat Mechanics\n--------------------\n\nFirearm Classification\nThe classification of modern firearms is unsystematic; categorizations do not meet a common definition. Below is the devised system to fix this explicit fault, enabling the ease of location within the database, and concise analysis of the desired weapon(s).\n\nErratic Shot - ES\n\t* An erratic array of projectiles ejected simultaneously for each trigger pull.\n\t* Discharges at 100mps and has a range of 200m.\n\t* Maximum impact velocity of 10,000psi. (per slug)\n\nPrecise Shot - PS\n\t* A single low caliber projectile is discharged for each pull of the trigger.\n\t* Discharges at 200mps and has a range of 400m.\n\t* Maximum impact velocity of 20,000psi.\n\nShort Rifle - SR\n\t* A systematic discharge cycle of low caliber rounds with each trigger pull.\n\t* Discharges at 400mps and has a range of 600m.\n\t* Maximum impact velocity of 40,000psi.\n\nMedium Rifle - MR\n\t* A systematic discharge cycle of medium caliber rounds with each trigger pull.\n\t* Discharges at 600mps and has a range of 800m.\n\t* Maximum impact velocity of 60,000psi.\n\nLong Rifle - LR\n\t* A single high caliber projectile is discharged for each pull of the trigger.\n\t* Discharges at 800mps and has a range of 1000m.\n\t* Maximum impact velocity of 80,000psi.\n\nPerformance Factors\nSize 3\n\nEnviron Conditions\nDescription\n\nWind Resistance \nDescription\n\nCombat Systems\nIntended to be used frequently, these systems are vital to the gameplay experience, the core functionality of the squad-based combat design. This functionality is not acquired in the single player mode until the player has experienced a particular mission.\n\nTargeting System\nWhen a hostile target is marked with the F key, it enables trajectory calculation, adjusting the crosshair height and accounting for the distance, bullet direction, wind speed, and wind direction, assisting the player in hitting their desired target with ease. It’s built in to the top attachments. Each species has a form of this system to utilize with the same performance rates; however the designs are entirely differed from one another.\n\nCommand System\nThe command system permits the player to direct AI teammates during a given combat scenario, they are as follows. F1 directs the AI infantry to advance from their current position and towards the enemy locations. F2 initiates the halting command, which directs the AI to the nearest cover position; they will remain there until the next command is given. F3 instigates suppressing discharge. F4 commands precision discharge. The F key directs one of the six soldiers in the squad to a specific position that the player has selected within the confines of their perception.\n\nSuppressing Discharge\nIntended to merely suppress opposing forces, this strategy is utilized to cover allies while locked in combat. This is done automatically by the squad’s AI team mates when necessary, and can be used by the player when they are not aiming down the sights with rapid fire weaponry. When used, the weapon is loosely pulled toward the body and the soldier is at a drawn back and upright position; cover is recommended.  \n\nPrecision Discharge\nIntended for precision and target impact, this tactic is utilized to incapacitate targets while engaged in a combat scenario. The AI uses this frequently when advancing towards the enemy positions, and can be used by the player when they aim down the sights with any weapon. \nWhen used, the weapon is tightly clasped to the body and the soldier is at a hunched over and focused position; accuracy is required.\n\n--------------------\nEntity Properties\n--------------------\n\nCategory Statistics\nAltered with player customization options, these include properties that don't entirely pertain to combat, properties that would alter power levels, energy recharge rates, hinder or improve character movement. These are applied to every item in the game.\n\nEntity Weight\nWeight properties are applied to entities that are customization enabled, the default gear and weapon provide a solid statistical basis. Logical requirements are applied to objects the player utilizes, for example a larger weapon will weigh more than a smaller, more compact one. The square-cube law is accounted for when creating armor sets, the larger the armor, the slower it must be, limitations are to be specified which prevent high or low weight extremes. The standard set of armor for each species has the most balanced weight ratio, the default basis.\n\nEntity Density \nQuite similar to the weight property with a few acknowledgeable variations, this statistic acts as a means of determining the level of defense an entity retains. This property is a constant with the Sapiens species due to their nanotechnology; it does not however, remain a constant for the Futurus and Evolutis, resulting varied damage effects. The standard set of armor has the most balanced density to weight proportions.\n\n--------------------\nEnvironmental Effects\n--------------------\n\nWeather\nTemperature, Weather, Time\n\nSize 4\nDescription \n\nTime\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------\nWarfare Consignment\n--------------------\n\nDescription\nEntirely customizable and intuitive to alter in the game, the Warfare Consignments are the preeminent technological assembly available to all combat personnel. It cannot be physically accessed until an assigned combat scenario arises. However, it can be remotely modified via an interface that is integrated into the personal shelters for the Sapiens, Futurus, and Evolutis species.\n\nConsignment Attributes\nThe feature permits highly modifiable components for firearms, armor, and gear, resulting in alteration of gameplay whenever the statistical status is changed. Players can monitor consignment weight, dexterity, and any of the three species’ defense stats.\n\nModifiable Components\n\t* Character Customization\n\t* Firearm Customization\n\t* Primary Firearm Selection\n\t* Secondary Firearm Selection\n\t* Tertiary Firearm Selection\n\t* Armor Component Selection\n\n--------------------\nCharacter Customization\n--------------------\n\nFunctionality\nWarfare Consignment Armor has a wide array of customizable components that affect the overall performance of the soldier. Factors such as optical enhancement, material density, power supplies, equipment allocation, and carrying capacity can all be altered by swapping or modifying the numerous components that are attributed to each variable.  A functionality that is fully accessible via the alteration terminal in military personnel shelters. Available for each species, they each retain varying traits. \n\nUpper Body\nDescription\n\nEyes\nEyes: Optical Brightness, Visual Magnification\n\nFace\nFace: Field of Vision, Visual Focal Point\n\nHead\nHead: Material Defense, Material Weight - (balance)\n\nCentral Body\nDescription\n\nChest\nChest: Material Defense, Material Weight - (balance)\n\nBack\nBack: Carrying Capacity, Tertiary Weapon Slot - (swap)\n\nArms\nArms: Material Defense, Material Weight - (swap)\n\nHands\nHands: Material Friction, Material Weight - (balance)\n\nLower Body\nDescription\n\nLegs\nLegs: Material Defense, Material Weight - (balance) Primary Weapon Slot\n\nWaist\nWaist: Carrying Capacity, Secondary Weapon Slot \n\nFeet\nFeet: Material Friction, Material Weight\n\nThe visual example below represents the method which is utilized to balance an armor’s defense; density, with its mobility; or weight in customization. The change is visually represented by the increasing or decreasing armor thickness when scrolling, scroll right to increase armor density, decreasing mobility, scroll left to increase mobility, decreasing armor density.\n\n\n\n (Re-work image with a gradient to better represent balance)\n\n--------------------\nFirearm Customization\n--------------------\n\nFunctionality\nThis personalization function alters combat equipment specifications; attachments, appearance, and the overall performance of the indicated firearm. Combatant personnel shelters; or Nanobot Enhanced Shelters, are equipped with a firearm modification terminal for users to operate. Other customizable features include firearm name and free-hand or pre-set acrylic designs. These components and attachments do not require an excessive number of individual models to adhere to each change. Rather, parts will lengthen in or shorten in height, increase or decrease in width, or simply change numerically when alterations are made.\n\nComponents\nThese individual components affect firearm performance, adjusting the rate of fire, magazine capacity, discharge range, muzzle velocity, impact force, sound detection radius, and weight. Many of the components have multiple positive or negative effects.  \n\nReceiver\nThe receiver affects the weapon’s rate of fire and discharge mode. The frequency at which bullets are discharged from the muzzle is commonly known as rate of fire, the higher the rate of fire the less firing stability.  When alternating receiver types, the part weight alters only slightly. Each weapon category has a maximum and minimum rate of fire adjustment, based upon the frequency at which the barrel overheats. \n\nMagazine\nOne of the most potent firearm components, the magazine determines the ammunition capacity of a specific weapon. The larger capacities result in encumbrance and reduced firing stability, while the smaller capacities result in lower weight hindrances and increased stability. The stability decreases due to the prolonged firing rates. If used with a burst or single fire functionality, the firearm will maintain stability.\n\n\n\nBarrel\nThe barrel of the firearm affects the range and impact force of the ammunition used. These statistics can be raised by increasing the barrel length; however this will also increase the weapon’s weight. Similarly, be lowered by decreasing the barrel’s length, reducing the weapons weight. The adjustments in number values are not displayed to the player, the system require a logic based understanding of firearms.\n\nMuzzle\nMuzzle: Detection Radius, Weight\n\nAttachments\nDescription\n\nSides\nSides: Various Functions, Weight\n\nLower\nLower: Various Functions, Weight\n\nUpper\nUpper: Optical Scope, Weight\n\n--------------------\nCharacter Skill System\n--------------------\n\nOrganism Endurance\nThe ability of an organism to exert itself and remain active for a long period of time, as well as its ability to resist, withstand, and recover from, and have immunity to trauma, wounds, or fatigue. These instances are tracked and upgraded in the game’s background; no statistics are displayed to the player, and are permanent once achieved. They will not degrade when unused. \n\nRunning\nDescription\n\nProcedural Memory\nDescription\n\nReloading \nDescription\n\nPerception\nDescription\n\nStability\nDescription\n\nClearance Level\nEntities are unlocked via an ‘advancement-by-use’ system which in principle grants the player attachments, components, gear, and firearms for the continual use of similar items. For instance, when the player uses a weapon classified as LR for a prolonged period of time, new attachments, components, and firearms will unlock for that classification in accord with the clearance level.\n\nThe Clearance Level is determined via ‘experience points’ or ‘XP’ for the player to observe as points gained. For Sentience, these experience points are not revealed to the player, rather they are tracked in the background beside a number of other statistics. Effectiveness during combat is statistically calculated subsequent to an assignment, positive results yield increased clearance levels and previously inaccessible weapon or armor schematics, whereas negative outcomes hinder individual user progression.\n\n--------------------\nElemental Resources\n--------------------\n\nSize 2\nSize 3\n\nSize 4\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------\nTheme Color Selection\n--------------------\n\nDescription\nPlayers are granted the option to select a theme color; neon in appearance, which contrasts the game's aesthetic. Utilizing this option visually alters entities, functions, and interfaces throughout the game in accordance to the player's individual selection.\n\nVisual Properties\nThis visual change is universal within the game and only can be altered when in the shelter options menu. A limited selection of neon colors is included at release; they can be altered in hue and saturation. Affected entities aren’t applicable to all species. \n\nAffected Entities\n\t* Armor Secondary Color\n\t* Apparel Secondary Color\n\t* Shelter Secondary Color\n\t* Firearm Secondary Color\n\t* Heads up Display Scheme\n\t* User Interface Scheme\n\t* Muzzle Flash Color\n\t* Entity Scanning\n\t* Item Interaction\n\t* Map Waypoints\n\t* Night Vision\n\n--------------------\nArmor Designs\n--------------------\n\nSapiens Armor\nDescription\n\nEvolutis Armor\nDescription\n\nFuturus Armor\nThe Futurus have adapted similarly to the anaerobic organisms discovered in the Terra Facility. It enables them to survive in low oxygen environments, however it’s a double edged sword, resulting in the eventual lethality of highly oxygenated environs. Due to this, the Futurus have designed their armor to sustain breathable conditions on the surface. It’s constructed with a robust interchangeable plating system. The armor is manufactured with limited elemental resources and technological capabilities\n\n--------------------\nClothing Designs\n--------------------\n\nSapiens Clothing\nDescription\n\nFemales\nSize 4\n\nMales\nSize 4\n\nEvolutis Clothing\nDescription\n\nFemales\nSize 4\n\nMales\nSize 4\n\nFuturus Clothing\nDescription\n\nFemales\nSize 4\n\nMales\nSize 4\n\n--------------------\nStructural Designs\n--------------------\n\nSapiens Designs\nCircular in structure, they provide the inhabitants with a means of traveling \n\nPersonal Shelter\nSize 4\n\nSize 3\nSize 4\n\nEvolutis Designs\nDescription\n\nPersonal Shelter\nSize 4\n\nSize 3\nSize 4\n\nFuturus Designs\nDescription\n\nPersonal Shelter\nSize 4\n\nSize 3\nSize 4\n\n--------------------\nFirearm Designs\n--------------------\n\nSapiens \nThis species utilizes their nanotechnology in a number of ways in their defensive equipment. Issued ammunition is designed to incapacitate a target upon impact, enabling an artificial paralysis and temporary hibernation. Following successful armor and tissue penetration nanobots are dispersed to repair damage and enable the beneficial effects. Captured soldiers are moved to a medical outpost and are sustained till the war subsides. The soldiers are well aware of this and fight for an eventual armistice. \n\nEvolutis\nCrudely manufactured in assembly lines below the surface, the robust, brutal technology they possess is designed to obliterate foes. Upon penetration the ammunition tears up an entity with corrosive chemicals, resulting in catastrophic damage to the entirety of an entities body. Their barbarous war-tech maintains an irrefutably low survivability rate; fatality is all too common upon encountering their military forces. However, this is not to say there are those who are willing to cause such devastation.\n\nFuturus\nHand crafted tools of defense, honorary to possess, their technology is respectively formidable. The individuals whom are granted the schematics to create these entities act as a final means of defense, only to appear if absolutely needed. The designs for their weaponry utilize the many natural substances they encounter for a number of situational uses, ranging from lethal natural poisons to human-made toxins. Most only permit themselves to utilize the lethal chemicals as an absolutely final resort. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------\nNarrative Conflict\n--------------------\nSize 2\nSize 3\nSize 4\n\n--------------------\nHomo Sapiens\n--------------------\n\nSpecies Description\nExceptionally comparable to modern humans, they retain the physical and cognitive characteristics; however, the societal structure they have constructed is beyond our own. They utilize nano-technology for virtually every aspect of their metropolis environment, enabling self-sustained living and seemingly limitless scientific ventures. Individuals within this society are exceptionally sophisticated in voluminous facets of knowledge, and understanding of the ever expanding universe.\n\nSocietal Traits\n\t* Selective Evolution of Species\n\t* Average Lifespan of 100 Years\n\t* Reproduction at the age of 30 \n\t* Crimes Result in Banishment\n\t* Scientific Understanding\n\t* Technocratic Government\n\t* Resource Based Economy\n\nCulture Safeguards\nDue to recent events, the Sapiens species has recently established a tactical combat force known as the Discord Regiment, a highly specialized combat corps, designated for safeguarding the cities inhabitants from external threats. They counteract hostiles with calculated precision, utilizing an extensive array of firearms, equipment, and non-lethal nano-ammunition.\n\nSafeguard Traits\n\t* Strenuous Training\n\t* Attentive Selection\n\t* Tactical Maneuvers\n\t* Strategic Planning\n\t* Regulated Conditions\n\n--------------------\nHomo Evolutis\n--------------------\n\nSpecies Description\nNot entirely dissimilar from their ancestors, they preserve many inherent ancestral traits, only divergent in minor physical ways. They inhabit the immense forests of the planet’s biosphere, dwelling in shelters that amalgamate into the lush green environs, cleverly exploiting the natural resources and upholding its natural state. The species is profoundly sentient in understanding of themselves and the world expressing great veneration for complacent societal interaction and reputable skirmish competition.  \n\nSocietal Traits\n\t* Natural Evolution of Species\n\t* Average Lifespan of 80 Years\n\t* Reproduction at the age of 20\n\t* Crimes Result in Concession \n\t* Sentient Understanding\n\t* Meritocratic Government \n\t* Barter Based Economy\n\nCulture Safeguards\nUnchallenged in the natural world for generations, they've merely developed practices towards maintaining nourishment sources, hunting prey and gathering resources. In an attempt to keep the peace between the other two species, these practices have not been altered. However, recent subversive training has instigated, obscured by leaders.\n\nSafeguard Traits\n\t* Learned Practices\n\t* Role Acceptance\n\t* Absolute Scrutiny\n\t* Repetitious Steps\n\t* Monitored Conditions\n\n--------------------\nHomo Futurus\n--------------------\n\nSpecies Description\nRemarkably adapted to an isolated environment below the planet’s surface, they now retain few of the physical traits of their ancestors. The subversive atmosphere they inhabit is progressively hazardous, operating as well as maintaining regressive machinery to sustain life. Industrial assemblies span throughout their cities, constructing tools intended for the populace. Their societies are largely superstitious, adhering to spiritual prophecies and sacred ancient rituals that govern their way of life.\n\nSocietal Traits\n\t* Artificial Evolution of Species\n\t* Average Lifespan of 60 Years\n\t* Reproduction at the age less than 20\n\t* Crimes Result in Punishment\n\t* Spiritual Understanding\n\t* Geniocratic Government\n\t* Monetary Based Economy\n\nCulture Safeguards\nAn almost entirely industrialized society has enabled them to overwhelm their enemies. Sheer quantities of militant production and infantry recruitment, has made a significant impact on the proclaimed adversaries.

Once acquired, this hardware will unlock a wealth of game design possibilities for Veritable Games.\n\nGame Engine: Unity Pro\nThe Unity Pro game engine may have some minor technical and graphical fidelity limitations compared to higher end engines such as Cry Engine 3; however I feel we can work around them if we are able to purchase higher end computers. \n\n3D Modeling: ZBrush\nThis software costs approximately $700, well worth the price. The comprehensible interface permits anyone to create dynamic and detailed models with very little prior experience. The site gives tutorials and an extensive number of tools are provided. \n\n3D Texturing: Photoshop CS6\nPhotoshop CS6 costs roughly $600, the program delivers a wide range of tools to utilize for exceptionally convincing texture creation for 3D models. When combined with the texture tools of ZBrush these two programs will be tremendous assets to us.\n\n--------------------\nPersonnel Cost\n--------------------\n\nProgrammers\nHire to develop the desired features for the fundamental aspects of the game’s mechanics.

These features will ultimately improve the player's experience as a community.\n\nAchievements\nSteam achievements are an integral part of the Steam community; this function entices the comprehensive exploration of the game, and provides players with a profound sense of accomplishment as they are rewarded individual achievements. These will range in difficulty, scale, and level of exploration or effort. They are to be listed following development success. \n\nSteam Market\nThe Steam market is a feasible method to receive the necessary income to complete updates and release free or lesser priced narrative DLC's. When a player collects cards, sells related items, or purchases badge rewards, the development team will make a portion of the proceeds which in turn go directly back into polishing the game and working towards further updates. \n\nSteam Cloud\nThe Steam cloud is a free service Valve provides for the community, it allows game saves and the linking of player profiles to specific Steam Accounts, rather than creating servers on our own strictly for this purpose. This feature will save time and a good portion of funding. \n\nSteam Play\nThis is a feature that permits the game to be purchased once for MAC, Linux, and PC. Unity makes development for the minority operating systems simple enough for this possibility. Doing so will increase revenue and the overall game community size. \n\nFirearm Updates\nSize 3\nSize 4\n\nGear Updates\nSize 3\nSize 4\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/Sentience_GDD.docx.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, character-design, dialogue, item, weapon, location, feature, gameplay, mechanic, fix\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.072Z",

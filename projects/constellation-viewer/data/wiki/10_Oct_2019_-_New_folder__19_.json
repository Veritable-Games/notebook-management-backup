But do they have a workshop style? I imagine~~\n~~I have, I release the game, it does not have workshop first, and I release all platforms~~\n~~ideally, but then the website has a system of creation and creation content that got a~~\n~~form of people with creating stuff. So the biggest issue of that is the submit stuff and~~\n~~the integration of the game. Well, I just, if they did the model, how would they make it,~~\n~~how are you going to bring it to the game? How am I going to, I just actually did create a~~\n~~model and I put it into the engine, or you know where it is. Now we have to patch it every~~\n~~copy of that game. Yeah, so I've got to keep the scope small and can't be too large~~\n~~in asset, but SBI sets that are worth buying to the player's mind. So say we have~~\n~~a home decorating, right? This is again, this is far off, this is stretchable, this is~~\n~~out of scope for now. But imagine you're designing the interior of this house, and~~\n~~you can choose what the house is, and the model is obviously not big and so you have a few~~\n~~different options, and you get more options at a time.~~ Imagine you're decorating this home,\nand you buy things to decorate it with, and then out of scope again, but if you would\nbuy your friends over the home, you know, it's like a, and then you go out and explore\nwith them. Well, it's about possession. You ought to be careful, I haven't too much buying\nstuff. Well, this would be grabbed up on a failure or not and paid a wedding scheme.\nNo, no, it's not paid a wedding, so it's paid a donate. No, people will accuse that.\nWell, let's be able to actually make clear that the artist is 30%, we only get 20%.\nIt's meant to be a platform, but that's the hiding, that you're going to hide in content\nbehind the paywall. That's something you're going to be careful about.\nBut what if I produce content? I'm not going to call that. I produce content.\nI have free content. You're going to, as soon as you build a paid workshop, that's what\nis going to be accused. Can I keep you going?\nCan I keep you going? It's purely content.\nNo, keep knowing the boxes. You're just buying furniture up. It's a cosmetic thing.\nWe explicitly state we'll be copied if you need it. Or if you get people like on\nPatreon, you don't want to care like this kind of idea, but imagine\nyou have a patron of this. What do you think the decision is just\ngetting it all together? Yeah. What are you going to congregate all these?\nOn the upside, of course. They submit to them.\nThere's only so much on my website that can handle it. No, but it's about to have\na decent database.\nMost of the biggest thing that kills most of the developers\nis overexpansion. Yeah, I've got to be careful. Scope is the biggest thing. Scope\ncreepy, killed note, killed a...\nThat one game, that one sci-fi game with...\nNot...\nGoddamn it.\nIt's been built for seven years. A long time, three years, four years.\n25.\nStar Citizen.\nOh, that's why it's still...\nYeah, because the creator, he's like, oh, this sounds cool. We have money now.\nOh, let's do that. He gets over the excited.\nI know where I'm scytheed that, but then they fixed themselves.\nBut you go down the road. So I think the balance between that is like...\nSelf-funded.\nLike, uh...\nStar Citizen, but you're scoped with them inside.\nYou know what Sky Citizen is large?\nI can handle the update that they have.\nNow that I have cash for this, I'll throw a money over this, so they're expanding content.\nA bit, a bit, a bit, a little bit, though, not...\nNot like huge updates, but...\nOh, that over time.\nDo you have a cell phone charger?\nInside.\nI mean, look, that's the needs, like, maybe teething, but it's...\nI don't know what kind of...\nJust a vehicle, like, uh...\nWell, then the same as the X on, the charger.\nOkay, yeah, they can charge you in there.\nIf you want to get started, I'm going to switch work on it.\nYou can carry that on.\nOr not, if you want.\nOh, work on it.\nWhat would you want to store it for?\nIt is the course.\nAnd what did that restart for?\nOkay.\nSo, okay, all right.\nI can charge...\nSo, I'm trying to figure out what we could do here.\nOkay.\nSo, let's just start now.\nImagine that you take root.\nAs the NDI.\nSo, what was that?\nYou were never the person.\nYou weren't the person.\nYou were the person.\nFor now, because if you were the person...\nWell, because if you...\nNo, so, you're still not familiar with it from away.\nYou're more liable to describe detail if you were standing back from the action...\nOkay.\nSo, that's actually not a bad commercial question.\nSo, I think that that means...\nThe player has...\nThey start as a dog, right?\nThey're absurdists.\nThey can't even think of that.\nI don't mean from a coach, it's one of you.\nI mean from an aerator's point of view.\nOh, you don't want to be the action you want to witness it.\nThe best way to imagine it is you are the third person in the room.\nYou were merely the third person.\nYou were in the context of writing, not the story itself.\nYeah.\nOkay, so, how would you do about writing?\nLet me describe something.\nYou go about describing it in a literally...\nLiterally...\nLiterally...\nSo, imagine to show off as the dog.\nIt has taken root.\nAnd at home.\nSo, I'm taking root outside.\nOthers take root in homes.\nI'm trying to tell them where they are.\nThey don't know.\nIt needs regard to this family.\nIs there a family?\nYeah, there is one person.\nA psychologist.\nShe...\nDoes she have family rules and spouses?\nOr is it just so?\nNot to the player's knowledge.\nSo, it's always you know it's just so.\nAs far as you know.\nWe might add more content.\nI don't know how to turn that.\nSo, for now, just say it's open.\nShe could have ham and she could not.\nAnyway, she...\nShe is a therapist.\nShe is a sociologist.\nA psychologist.\nYou're getting caught up too much in the private detail.\nAnyway, so...\nSo, she's in a lounge.\nA lounge, bar,\na часть of therapists, office,\nagency in general.\nSlightly destazilly\nwith loose homed troop.\nNot as exposed.\nThere's a very conduct.\nYou take the ideal that you take a moment\nin its unmute zone,\nif it's Heroic�.\nIt's ideal to have a time.\nA moment for it's just an inspection before you\nwant to know.\nSo they have people coming around here.\nSo there's a divide there?\nYou're a divide between the room that the one and one such is.\nThat's an awesome view.\nOh, you can see the door.\nNot really, kind of a seat, dude.\nIt's OK.\nNo, I thought it's OK.\nIt's OK.\nThere's a big, OK-ish.\nTranslucent, but not.\nI don't know if she would.\nThere's a hospital security class.\nWell, a little more, I said it.\nOh, I got an office.\nOh, so it is a security class that, from one side,\nyou can't see with the other side, you can't.\nYeah, that's not that, actually.\nI suppose you can have some glass inside the building itself.\nBecause a lot of it doesn't look like Okinawa.\nOK, reference.\nI need to open the space a little bit more\nfor the pretty glass in front of it.\nBut, casually, in front of the office, not in front of it.\nTwo vehicles.\nSo a lot of offices they hide it by putting it as a wall?\nWell, you're not hiding it, do you talk about the wall?\nNo, it's not like they want it to hide it,\nbut they put like screens on it.\nThey said that we thought this, you know,\ngo in, this is some wall that's opaque.\nThey put stuff on the wall to get you something to look at.\nOK, imagine this.\nImagine you're stepping in the room and then on the actual wall.\nYou don't actually see the room you see outside.\nYou see the wall, though, those walls that actually\ncan shake like an oven.\nPsychopaths, which we see now,\nthey have these electronic walls that change NAR, actually.\nSo, cheers, these.\nI guess that the technology goes into your eyes\nand you can see the custom colors and the lighting.\nI don't know if you got the set up for that.\nYeah, it's energy efficient, and so,\nbecause you're classified your entire space in N-30.\nIt's again in the yard, but more than one at all times,\nbecause it's built in here, in your system.\nYou were talking about the washroom?\nWashers?\nIn a washroom.\nIn the show, washroom, you see it.\nThey have this thing, I think it's called the tube,\nthe bottom right there.\nThe one?\nIt's called the tube.\nIt's an attenuation room.\nI kind of like the design of how it does.\nIt is a box with a rounded top line.\nThe way that it's lit, it looks like it's going in here.\nAnd it's much more great.\nWhat do you mean by God?\nSo, it's around now on top of the tube.\nIt's the floor is lit up with white light,\nand so are the walls and the ceiling,\nand there's only one thing in the ceiling\nthat breaks up the whole view.\nBut when you look at the walls, the way\nthat they hide the roof with the light\nis it looks like it keeps extending out\nbeyond the room.\nIt's a visual effect that they tube light in.\nThat's cool.\nThat's also visual.\nI've got to find that difference.\nAre you good, good, good, good?\nThat's a timestamp, look at it.\nI'll figure it out there.\nI'll figure it out there.\nI'll try to get some timestamps.\nThere's a lot of stuff there.\nOh, no.\nOh, okay, okay.\nI've got a sponge.\nThere you go.\nOh, it needs to choke.\nOh, yeah, I don't know what to say.\nMight as well be fucking beautiful.\nIf you need a treasure now, should I go in there?\nJust a little bit, yeah.\nOh, yeah.\nI don't know.\nIt might have been the computer's empty.\nOh, shut up.\nNo, it's just dead.\nOh, I've got the cord, the school's even seen.\nOkay.\nI'm gonna run this fan, or shit, we can plug this in\nor I can help you when we can't help for a minute.\nYeah, don't worry.\nWell, because I've only seen it before,\nit might help to get us the sheet of paper.\n\n\n====== REC003.txt ======\nI intend the machine's AEI to be designed this way for a reason.\nI'm trying to articulate something, I'm trying to articulate the development of a sentient AI.\nYou're starting out from simple aggression and anxiety, you're able to go way up to one more complex emotions.\nUntil you have a full Dodeck.\nThe full Dodeck of emotion, Dodeck of expression, Dodeck of behavior and intent.\nIt's not a perfect, it's a more of an abstraction, but it's meant to convey the expressive nature of humans during interactions.\nIf you learn the language, you can emphasize more without them having to spell it out.\nIt helps the actors read into the character, play into the character, because they're given an exact direction in terms of their character's motivation and intent and behavior and feelings and such.\nOkay, well see you in the way forward.\nDodeck should be secondary to the main story.\nYou don't even have a war right now.\nWhat color the sky has, we can take a lot of steps back.\nAre you skipping a bunch of detail, which is what the storyboarding is?\nI know what the world is, the world is Chion.\nAnd Chion is a Chion.\nYou know what it is.\nI need to know what it is.\nI need to put it in the game as a document and then we can go from there.\nSo I can check it out to you guys, the full aspect of the story.\nSo I think when you hear a story, you're missing trouble putting it.\nI like rule building, right?\nYou like story.\nThat's why I need you, because you're more inclined to write characters.\nI'm more inclined to write world.\nIf I can do it, you don't even write in the world.\nYou don't have a war right now.\nYou have a name.\nHow much the world didn't know?\nWhat else do you know?\nThat's what we're going to do in storyboarding.\nWe're going to have to figure it out.\nThe color of the soil, the color of the buildings, the color of what people wear, what colors they like.\nI've got to use the references to find them better.\nI'm not just that.\nYou've got to build the whole social structure of this entire 20 billion population.\nYou've got to figure out what other taboo is, what's acceptable, what are social cues.\nWhen they scroll around their chin as I mean, I think it doesn't mean no.\nWhen you're able to hold a sketch in the chin, you have to figure out how they interact.\nDo they communicate more with their bodies, or do they vote for communication.\nOr it comes off second in populations, well, the simplest way of carrying yourself,\npeople know something that's on the view, or do they have to invade them.\nWe've got to figure out foods, social customs around food.\nSo we've got to define these aspects better.\nI think we can work with them.\nBecause right now all you really have is a scientist and explore some robots and a cube.\nThat's how a little moon.\nYou have pieces of a world we have to build the rest still.\nYeah, that's the social aspect.\nSocial space.\nThat's the social aspect.\nYou want to do this whole thing about conversations.\nYeah, conversations which is frustration, not suicide.\nYou've got to build the world around that now.\nBuild the world around the conversation.\nOkay?\nBecause you don't know that.\nYou want your world.\nSo you want your world to be communal and open.\nSo open, yeah.\nYou have to explain why.\nOkay.\nYou can't just have a date.\nI know like this.\nCould you come up with a list of questions about the world?\nWell, that's what we're going to do tomorrow.\nWe're going to do it on the day.\nYeah.\nSo I would take a minute to get what I need you to build us.\nThere's just a rough outline of like general behavior.\nOkay.\nBehavior and then that'll behave your sociology.\nMore sociology.\nAnd more culture and more, you know, anthropological.\nWe don't need to know what the world looks like.\nWhat we really need to know is what the world is.\nWell, the world, what it looks like is a part too.\nBecause it's a vertical structure.\nRemember, these are...\nYou know, I mean...\nI think you're getting caught up in it too much again.\nI mean, like...\nOkay.\nWe need to know...\nThe overall feeling, not the...\nI know, just...\nI need to know what it looks like.\nJust that.\nI don't need a bunch of stuff.\nI just need to know what it looks like.\nOkay.\nSo, like...\nBecause...\nIs it arid?\nIs there a fence?\nBecause people that grow up around the fence,\nsomeone pathetic, the nurse,\ngonna go up in the mountains,\nand the mountains,\nthey tend to be harsher,\nmore independent types.\nBecause...\nIt's a harsher,\nliving in a satellite,\nthough the communities are smaller and closer to it.\nBut,\nplanes community,\ntypically tend to be bigger and more social,\nbecause they have more supplies.\nThey're not struggling as much,\nbecause there's more,\nbut in game,\nit's not the only solution.\nUm, step up and I will do the exact same thing.\nSo, definitely,\nI need to find this more tomorrow.\nI'm sure.\nIt is a post-scarcity society,\nit's a society where there is...\nNo, no.\nNo, no, no, it's scarcity.\nSee, you're mistreating it again.\nIt's about like...\nThere's no plant life.\nYeah, there's lots of plant.\nIt's a solar conquery,\nthat's it's green,\nit's lush,\nit's gorgeous,\nbut it's also...\nSee, they changes...\nThis is the fact that those plants change them.\nPeople that are around plants tend to have a different outlook\nthan those that grow up in more cityscape.\nIt's more comfortable.\nIt's more natural as it's more.\nIt's not even that.\nIt's just more warm.\nIt's cozy.\nIt's...\nImagine the warmth of campfire and...\nSee, you're getting...\nYou're getting too precise again.\nOkay.\nYou have to be very abstract\nbecause you want to avoid locking yourself down\nbecause campfire was locked you down to outside.\nWhen we're talking about more like,\nif those plants, it means some more like\nthere would be a pathetic video in the mountains.\nOkay, that makes sense.\nYou're finding more care for traits and their actual thing.\nYeah, because right now we've got to figure out what the world is.\nBecause you know what it is, but now we've got to figure out\nhow to convey it to the rest.\nRight.\nRight now.\nYeah, we're going to have to...\nWe've got three hours.\nWe're going to do the storyboard just before we even do the story.\nWe've got to figure out what are the parameters.\nWhat's...\nSet the boundaries, set the stage.\nYeah, that's what I was trying to use that as an example before.\nBecause you have all the detail inside of it,\nbut nothing leaves it.\nSo, before we even get it going,\nwe need to figure out what it looks like.\nThat's why we need paper so we can do the rough sketching of\njust that specific video.\nBecause we don't want to build the whole world yet.\nBecause you want to let your cultivars do that.\nAll we're doing is trying to figure out the social aspect of it.\nAnd then we have...\nWhen we had that defined, we can better treat the characters in the world.\nBecause right now, we just kind of want to get a loose...\nWe're not trying to build a support as much as we're trying to.\nIt is to build something in the whole world right now.\nBecause we don't have everything together.\nYou want to let them...\nThey're going to be the detail.\nWe're just building the spine.\nOh, that's where I'm putting it.\nWe're literally just giving them the structure to build off of it.\nWe don't want to limit them to a sort of aspect.\nWe don't want to make the show...\n\n\n====== REC004.txt ======\nSo imagine multi-color plants.\nRed and orange and green.\nYou're going back and you're getting wake up.\nOkay, well, try to imagine...\nWell, vibrant social space.\nIt's actually a space where there's color in it.\nIt's not dark and you talk in a dystopic light.\nIf you see a modern section, use in that.\nThen I'll just say it's a solar pump world.\nThat's it.\nYou don't want to destroy the world.\nThat's a sunny point though.\nIt's a utopian non-combat game.\nWhat do you want to do?\nI don't want utopia.\nIt's a kind of a mixed meaning.\nIt's kind of a problem.\nI don't mind it.\nIt would be a better way.\nUtopia has got cold implications attached to it.\nBecause when you tell people you talk to them,\nthey just kind of shut off on you.\nWhy?\nWhy, why, why, why, why, why do you want to shut it here?\nI'm going to start with that.\nLet's start with that one.\nI was going to describe it.\nThat's when you're up.\nI guess.\nJust let me know.\nIt hasn't taken you out for this.\nIt's about seven minutes.\nThat's it.\nThat's not a bad idea, actually.\nI don't know why.\nI'm probably going to be a little bit lower because\nwe're going to be bouncing around.\nSo I'm going to play Lovecraft in the background.\nNot just, not for like an example,\nbut just so you can get a feel of what we're trying to do.\nOkay.\n\n\n====== REC005.txt ======\nmore than a surprise for you.\nIt wasn't that it was more terrifying out of here.\nSo we weren't supposed to understand what these things were.\nWe were supposed to exist in a plane that we detect,\ngo for a hint of them.\nBecause literally, when your story is the only one that can actually\nsimply look like what I'm saying to you.\nWhat do you guys know?\nThey seem so cosmic.\nThe older they know, the better it was.\nNice, really cool storyline.\nBack in that.\nI don't know your depth of discord at all.\nIt goes well with Jack, but I'm probably going to stay for\nan half hour or so.\nOkay, yeah, discord works.\nAnd then I'm going to pass out a broken place too.\nIt works.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nthe\nI'm

No, it would be how would you describe\nYou're setting a scene setting\nBut you have the character interactions in the world building and I want to do both, right?\nYou have the, uh, you're setting a scene, scene setting and you have world building, you have both\nAnd story building\nStory building\nStory building\nStory building\nSo I have this thing called NDD, especially a narrative design document\nThat's, I got to separate things out because you're right, it's, it's, it's, it's too dense\nIf I, storyboarding\nA narrative design document\nA narrative direction document, I can say\nStory building\nStory building\nOkay, should I cut like the, uh, creative direction document\nDo you think I could do both these world building and story building one document?\nYeah\nYou think they were sparse?\nDon't you, right? I think that we will need, uh, a good amount of room to work with\nThe pieces, what do you mean?\nOkay, so overall\nSo that's like the overall story, that's the character story, but, um, I think games have an interesting opportunity here\nWe have, we can have sub stories and we can have overall stories\nOh, the six main characters, the six, all right\nI think you\nYeah, I think you're in the redirection there, I think you're, you're accurately, or you're, you've got your description of what we need to do there\nIt doesn't make sense\nUh, there's a way to, on Google Drive at this, there's a way to, or I could do a Dropbox actually, I like it better\nWe could have sections, sampled out in a form, private form\nLike you have, it's always mechanically laid out in, but you have them done in order, like a PDF, not to the PDF for the team, they covers everything, like an actual game design document\nOkay, so I'm thinking here, look my screen real quick, I'll show you what I'm doing\nOops\nOops, uh, the screen share, okay\nSo I had information here, right, and I have, I've just a little bit, that I worked out, that I kind of finalized, but then over here\nOn this side, this is the actual game design document, or a part of that anyway, this is a gutted version, because I want to keep the formatting\nI need to, this is my focus, right, and I want to keep, provide the categories that work to explain it better\nSo let's see, um, one for characters, one for behaviors, one for like that kind of thing, and I, um, character behaviors\nFor example, how do you, what might, what might be a good way to, uh, flare or take you late one, I give you a character, any character\nLet's see\nSo I fully convey some aspect of, that, with that character, so let's say, um, with their character\nSo I, I think that works\nSo I've been thinking about the characters for a while\nUm, that was last year, there's still nothing, then, and, let's see\nOkay, well this is more, imagine, because of scope, and because of how difficult it is to create new languages\nEnglish persists, because there's like a hundred people who are so that, that call us the area and then it\nNot really\nOkay, all three things on, I've got to think about some more, um, what time are you going to be up tomorrow?\nOkay, yeah, just to be up and ready, I'm gonna stay up, I'm gonna kind of create a template for this, uh, process, like, um, ask me some questions about the world and kind of fill that, that knowledge\nUm, that time works\nOkay, let's wake up whenever I'm not, I'm not gonna rush you

inarticulate.\nIts low walls nearly hidden by the sands of uncounted ages.\nIt must have been thus before the first stones of Memphis were laid, and while the bricks\nof Babylon were yet undate, there is no legend so old as to give it a name, or to recall\nthat it was ever alive.\nBut it is told of in whispers around campfires, and muttered about by grandams, the\nintense of shakes, they think its folklore, for the rest of the world, the people in this\ndesert knows real, but everyone else can make the desert folklore, like the digit or something.\nDamn.\nWho's people want to go to the city, because anyone in the desert of the city either dies\nor comes back and say, they want to stay away from the city.\nTribe shunned without only knowing why.\nIt was of this place that Abdul Al-Hazret, the mad poet, dreamed on the night before\nhe sang his unexplainable couplets.\nThat is not dead, which can't eternal lie, and with strange eons even death may die.\nSo that is Azathaf, Azathaf, the Qatulah.\nThe number Azathaf I told you is the dead dumb dream that will exist in his dream.\nQatulah is the embodiment of his power within that dream, so as calm on the reports he\nwas Azathaf's son, Qatulah is the gatekeeper and the gate, he is the lock and the key.\nSo in H.P. Lovecraft universe, the gods know they're going to win, look great war against.\nThose are God known as Yagsaath.\nHe is the one that knows of the gate, so it's what they came to last time, and they know\nwhere it is they know how to open it, the promise is they need humans to open it.\nBut because they were fighting to do it, they were the group on all side, and as aware of\nit, this is that it's fighting the Sparrow to keep humanity going, they know eventually\nthey were going to lose or just trying to fight time.\nThat's the whole theme of Lovecraft, as we know we're losing the war, we're just literally\nbuying time as much as we can to see we can figure out a way to kill them, because the creatures\nthat killed them died in the process, so we only have wreckages of what they used to\nkill them in pieces, we can't fully stop them, we can just impede their progress.\nAnd so this whole group's purpose is they know that they've already lost, that they're\njust buying an extra day every once in a while.\nThat's like climate change, they realize they've lost, and they realize they're just\nband-aiding it as much as they can.\nAnd the doctor explains that he's like, no, we don't want to, so they win, so the creatures\nknow they win.\nSo because of it, they're not going to hold you to win, so they're just fucking of humanity.\nThat's like the yellow king I told you about, his sign, if you really wanted to, all you\nhad to do is put it in a cloud, and you could kill a whole continent, but he doesn't, he\nhides it, he has this quote, and he convinced them that it's religious, and all of it shows\nit can see it.\nThat's how they call it.\nSo the ritual is how you get shown it, and eventually it drives you fucking batshit.\nOne guy described it as static, but each time he slept, the static got clearer and clearer,\nand finally it turned to voices, it was whispers.\nAnd then the whisper slowly got louder and louder, and then I still feel like, you're forming\na consciousness here.\nSo you're grazing him in his sleep, and then it slowly turned to hands.\nAnd this was his dreams, he was envisioning this, and the only way he fixed it was he\npoured gas in on himself, and let himself look out.\nOh, go back to the grandfather and the grandson, did you explain the situation again?\nThe, um, explain the whole route from the grandfather taking control, the grandfather\nassuming a consciousness was in the mind of this grandson, yeah, taking control of his\nwas always there.\nWhat happens is he made a deal with a worshiper of the old ones a long, long time ago, and\nthey promised, cause so here on the site of the grandson's house, there was a house, there\nwas a swamp, and a path that goes through it, and at the end of this path is a broken\ntowel.\nOh my God.\nWhen a grandson inherited it, he was told, do you not touch the swamps, the towel, touch\nnothing.\nThe house exactly as it is.\nOkay, so, oh Leo, can I, can I go back to that?\nYeah.\nAlright, so I'm thinking, this story in mind, this analogy, you just come up with a general\nmap of the area, if this is the hub, and this is the area you explore, imagine this\narea being a little larger, but it's like this, and you explore more regions, or it can\nget larger as we produce more content.\nSo, the reason why they used the swamp is, because this towel was hidden, not everyone\nknew about it, so the interesting thing about the towel is it was made out of a gray stone\nand not from the area, and there was a symbol buried on it.\nIt was a broken pill with a torch inside, but you can envision that, a torch inside?\nYeah, a broken pill capsule with a torch inside of it, almost like a streak of lightning.\n\n\n====== REC008.txt ======\norder ones.

They understand that these are...\nNo, I'm not saying they understand these are just worms.\nThey think of the tower.\nThey don't give...\nThey do aspire to similar star meaning and they know it's Earth.\nOh, so they see the light and they know it's Earth.\nThey think that Earth is in spirit because humanity drives there.\nAnd they've been there because they drive there.\nBut why do we have Dyson's form? Why do...\nThe Earth has Dyson's form and I first...\nDoesn't have Dyson's form and this one does have a Dyson's form.\nSo what is the difference?\nWell, we've aspired...\nThey don't know that we've aspired to hold it.\nThey think that...\nBecause humanity drives there, because you're mentioning well that they've been allowed to...\nHe wants to keep the star of a lit.\nIt's what they believe.\nBecause they're...\nSo is that still a whole thing?\nThat light they see, that also not.\nIt is Earth.\nThe light is Earth, but then...\nSo...\nHe's thinking that the actual action...\nWe shouldn't reveal the door again.\nNo, I don't want to reveal the door again.\nI'm talking about it.\nYou said that most of the stars are in the Dyson's form, correct?\nYeah.\nYou said that those are single bright winded by stars.\nThis was all when...\nThe figure of the tower, we said that they draw strength in the tower, at least emotionally.\nIs there anything that they've applied to that store, it being the only wet store?\nDid they give it a meaning, like how we give our son, meaning our son is just a store?\nBut...\nThink of it, there were sun coats.\nThere were the tarot coat that was built around quenching the thirst of this god,\nnot because it told them to.\nBecause we looked at it, and we figured that there was something to it.\nWhat could they aspire to, if it wasn't superstitious?\nThat wasn't immediately...\nOf course, of course.\nOr imagine they...\nThey wanted to make themselves better for the youngness.\nOr they believed the youngness race?\nOr they...\nOh yeah, exactly the thing.\nThey could view it like the torch and the darkness.\nYou know what that means?\nTorch and darkness.\nGo for it.\nSo, the four of you would give it a fire.\nHumanity was a core dumb species.\nThis is a Greek man talking about, of course, they give it a fire for medias.\nBefore humanity was given fire, the guards would watch us suffer in the cold and the dark beast\nwould attack us at night because they were not afraid.\nThe darkness would hide them.\nHumanity was doing awful crimes each other because no one could see.\nWe had these dark spots.\nAnd in these dark spots, they weren't these people evil,\nbut the darkness in those swords amplifies.\nThere was nothing there to guide them, so they would lash out.\nImagine in this event, I'm going to go

city told of in strange tales, but seen by no living man, yet I defied them and went\ninto the untrodden waste with my camel.\nI alone have seen it, and that is why no other face bears such hideous lines of fear as\nmine.\nWhy no other man shivers so horribly when the night wind rattles the windows.\nWhen I came upon it in the ghastly stillness of unending sleep, it looked at me, chilly\nfrom the rays of a cold moon amidst the desert's heat, and as I returned its look I forgot\nmy triumph at finding it, and stopped still with my camel to wait for the dawn.\nFor hours I waited till the east grew gray and the stars fitted, and the gray turned\nrosy light edged with gold.\nI heard a moaning and saw a storm of sand stirring among the antique stones, though the sky\nwas clear and the vast reaches of the desert still.\nThen suddenly above the desert's far rim came the blazing edge of the sun, seen through\nthe tiny sandstorm which was passing away.\nAnd in my fevered state I fancied that from some remote depth there came a crash of musical\nmetal to hail the fiery disc as Memnon hails it from the banks of the Nile.\nMy ears rang and my imagination seeth, as I led my camel slowly across the sand to that\nunvocal stone place, that place too old for Egypt and Merua to remember, that place which\nI alone of living men had seen.\nIn and out amongst the shapeless foundations of houses and palaces I wandered, finding never\na carving or inscription to tell of those men, if men they were, who built the city and\ndwelt there in so long ago.\nThe antiquity of the spot was unwholesome, and I longed when a counter-somer sign would\ndevice to prove that the city was a deep patch on the by-man kind.\nThere was a second provocation.\nI think you catch what he said, do you agree with it?\nWhen he started off the city he was like, he said he couldn't find anything that showed\nthe men that had built the city and the men had built it.\nSo that with low cap, he doesn't really start off with its monsters.\nHe always has an out for the character to explain the phenomena.\nLike the character is in, he goes in, see something in all sense, oh it's a demon, it's, well\nI thought I heard music.\nSo like with this one, this guy as he slowly explodes, it's not what he sees, it's what\nhe knows isn't there, it starts hitting him off, it's something's off about the city.\nI had proportions and dimensions in the ruins which I did not like.\nI had with me many tools and dug much within the walls of the obliterated edifices, the\nprogress was slow, and nothing significant was revealed.\nWhen night and the moon returned, I felt a chill wind which brought new fear so that\nI did not dare to remain, and as I went outside the antique walls to sleep, a small sighing\nand the storm gathered behind me, blowing over the grey stone, the storm was bright, and\nmost of the city coming off.\nYeah, that's just the, imagine I awake, just it dawned, and I'm agitated with horrible dreams.\nI don't know why I was expecting this for so many times, no, no, this is important.\nI saw the sun, so this is here, the last gusts of a little sandstorm that hovered over\nthe continuous city down the slumark, and I know quite often that the two poor kids just\ntalk about what we have right now.\nI don't want you to rush it, don't rush it, I don't want you to rush it, don't rush\nit.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nSo here's a reference I want you to look at, because I think it's relevant to what\nyou're doing.\nRemember what I sent you yesterday in this corner?\nThe inside of those, that tarot David, let's see if we can find it in there.\nSo see how they torn these slices into actual spaces, are you sending it to the concept\notis?\nYeah.\nIt's referring to reference I suppose?\nYeah.\nSo you see how this is rounded?\nLook at what they did here, they torn the each slice into its own little section of life\npretty much.\nSo imagine the space between this, imagine the space is in between this, in large, that\nwhere there's enough sunlight coming in, that's what this is for, right?\nYou also got to remember that this is the opposite of what you're trying to convey, the\nbidding on a convex, you're bidding on a concave, right?\nOkay.\nSo imagine, I'm not even worried about the shape.\nWhat I'm talking about is exclusively the people, because see how they use all this space\nthey didn't waste anything.\nYeah.\nIt's efficient with space, but it's also comfy enough.\nSo what is the edging, or are you still establishing what they explain?\nThey imagine this is the same space, they can't expand it, hypothetically, but they need\nto have stronger structures.\nSo they're out of the limitation of expansion right now, you see?\nYeah.\nThese are little clones, this is how far they can build.\nSo then we want to convey that, and the narrative, you want to write that down in the\ndocument, that they're still building on the city.\nOkay.\nLet me just write that down.\nWell, because we have it here.\nOh, shit.\nMeo.\nOkay.\nLet's go.\nWell, because that's going to change the narrative, because if they realize that the city's under\nconstruction, the city is going to have a way to make the growth on the other side of\nthe city.\nWe're growing.\nIt's.\nBen.\nSo for example, don't have the careful walk by and say, oh, we want a construction, have\na walk by, but maybe nod to it, shucks, yeah, or the construction workers of robots, and\nthen the machine, the player doesn't know that yet.\nI mean, there's typical machines, there's no small robots, not just social, I don't know,\nthere's dodax.\nOh, there's no, there's human machines, but they're still going to be human oversight.\nThey're, they're autonomous.\nThey're what?\nThey're still being so annoying to be there.\nThey're autonomous to the best degree we can, we can make them.\nI'm not talking about what they're doing, I'm not talking about that, it's all the thing\nwe trust.\nWhat do you mean?\nI trust the machines?\nNo, not even that.\nI don't know if you would have a person there just to kind of keep the way that people\nfrom fucking with the robots.\nYou don't, not necessarily, it's trusting, people know that these robots help, and they're\ncute, but they're so annoying.\nThey're like, they're going too crazy, sir.\nYou need to slow your own.\nNo, people aren't as cruel as you, Mike.\nNo, I'm not even saying, so you keep saying that, I'm saying that.\nI'm not saying anything cruel.\nI'm not saying anything cruel.\nNo, not cruel, not cruelty.\nI'm asking you.\nI think you have some reason.\nI miss, I misspoke, I misspoke.\nSo literally all I said was I was so in at the site.\nOkay.\nThat's all I've conveyed.\nI haven't put in a motion on it.\nI didn't mean that.\nIt's all I've said was I was so in at the site.\nBut the human would be though trying to figure out the level of progress.\nThere's someone working on request, someone designing machines, maybe someone to ink\nwith them.\nOkay, but who's the thing?\nThere could be a local mechanic or whatever, but you need to get the code to send\nan interactive.\nBecause if you don't want to say there's a construction site, how are you going to have\nthem interact with the construction?\nWhat if that's the one thing the society likes?\nWhat if what if construction is the one thing that they know they need?\nBut no one is, there's not enough people going to do it.\nWell, it's not about the, there's a little bit, a little bit of, you can't cut it up\nagain.\nI'm not saying he's building on it.\nI'm just saying he's there at the location for the code to interact with.\nBecause he can't have a colonization for a robot, he said the basic robots.\nSo it doesn't have to be so in attached to the construction.\nI'm just saying those so-and-for-them interact with, it brings the construction view into\ntopic.\nOkay, yeah, yeah, it works.\nSo imagine, okay.\nSee, I'm not trying to say there's an overload or a watchman, I'm just trying to say those\nso-and-so.\nBecause we have to talk about the construction, so we don't want to say he's building where\nhe's watching.\nOkay, so imagine this thing.\nSorry, scratch.\nOh no.\nI'm starting scratch.\nTurn on suction scratch.\nI'm building off this.\nI'm trying to use your idea to read better, better convey this idea.\nOkay, so imagine you are the AEI, you're on the space.\nThere is a lack of maintenance, there's enough maintenance, it's well-camped.\nBut there needs to be more maintenance there is, and no one in this local space is willing\nto step up to do it.\nIt's a community effort.\nYou've got to have mechanical skill, you've got to have mechanical knowledge, like a social\ncultural thing.\nNo one's going to do it.\nBut no one has enough, these things are small, they're non-concentral, people don't do\nit.\nThere are small fixes on small stuff too, whatever, but I mean it's not going to process\nsome maintenance.\nI would illustrate that, not that it's being left behind, but it's being given a smaller\npriority.\nYeah.\nYou're right, they're building outwards, that's why the most of the construction focuses\non that.\nOh my god, Leo.\nOkay.\nThat's perfect.\nYou have to have the empathetic, so they're not just going to be like, oh, that's your\nguy, that's probably him.\nNo, it's like, okay, they're not on.\nPeople that could be doing this, they're instead they're out there and they're building\ntowards Utopia, they're building out the city, they're just going to be like, well, I'm not\ndoing that.\nYou need to explain why it's not being addressed, because you said they were empathetic,\nthey're Utopia, no more, so they have enough resources.\nSo for us, we would say, well, that's a little priority, but for them, we would have to\nfigure out why is a little priority for them, so we could use the construction outwards.\nSo we need to then figure out a way to bring in the AI into that process.\nMaybe have the Portuguese meeting?\nOkay.\nImagine that guy being a local engineer.\nImagine that guy going to be walking on this, or as he just passing by, that's something\nwe need to consider before he takes the wrong steps into the narrative.\nLet's say he's trying to find a location, maybe they know that the dodex can be conscious\nand he's trying to learn how to make it conscious, he's trying to learn how to make it, I know\nthey're trying to do this.\nHe knows how to make them analyst, he knows how to make them, you know, get them on the\nfeet, so to speak, put them in that moving form.\nAnd this AI doesn't get, doesn't get, go out to the get to the place.\nThis is, okay, this is the player, but they can't get an analyst to form, they're not\ndeveloped enough, they can't actually jump to an analyst to form that way.\nSo instead, they have to be tied to a body.\nThey're given a mechanical form, they're given a normal human machine form to latch onto\nthe nervous system.\nWe have to have a way to have the player talk to people.\nRight, and that's the beeping, that's the, so they, they get the,\nthey're not talking, I mean, we need to wait for force conversation.\nSo hang on, coming back to it, stepping back again, hang on.\n\n\n====== REC012.txt ======\nSo I imagine the player starting off as a camera as we discussed, and it can appear in different areas of the room.\nOkay.\nYes, it can appear in different areas.\nOr maybe it's sprouts in the point.\nIt cannot weave to the room.\nLike a lot on details could go on.\nAnyway, so it starts in the point.\nAnd how does it interact with?\nBecause people recognize it as a thing that's going to happen.\nThey see it's going to sprout soon.\nSo it's hanging in there, ready to wake up, and they're ready forward to...\nIt brings blanks to life.\nOh, hey, it's a wake.\nOkay, so they're awake.\nOh, hey, they're awake.\nThey recognize it as something that's a potential being.\nAnd then the player gets his first place eventually.\nThey find a mirror in the mirror in the bathroom.\nBecause that's a weird spot.\nBut that's when it's open when the one's there.\nThey wander in a mirror.\nWhoa.\nI think it's in my hands.\nBut it's more of a...\nHow would it force conversation?\nNot how he talks, but how are we going to get him talking?\nLike, what is the trigger for why he's at this construction site talking to this person?\nBecause it's around in passing.\nLet's say it's a little bit further on the story.\nSo pausing on the intro.\n\n\n====== REC013.txt ======\nAnd then we're talking to the guy that the sixth person that isn't in the room, he's talking to you.\nHuh?\nSo, you don't have to, this is why.\nSo imagine this construction, this engineer, this whole engineer.\nHe is, he's the maintenance guy.\nHe built this body for the, for the, for the dodaq.\nHe recognizes that it needs a form and it can't form into a,\nanything more complex because they communicated this.\nThey found out it's like, you know, maybe, maybe, hey, if you want to join us some time,\nbut it's rooted, it can't move, so we give it a new root.\nAnd the root is the body that they can move around in.\nWhy are they talking?\nThey're talking because they're trying to make sure it can move.\nMake sure he's inside of the construction.\nHe's not assigned, he's, he's, it's all following his work.\nNo, I mean, is he going to work on it?\nHe wants to work on it, he's curious.\nHe's interested in helping this machine,\nforming to a time.\nIf they want to, it's more of a curiosity thing in humanity.\nI mean, it's, it's like voluntary like the rest of the community.\nYou can go around fixing stuff you want to.\nAnd you can't stay with us against that, actually.\nNo, it is.\nIn this society, in this, in this society, fixing things is encouraged.\nIt's like, you, people are constantly, people can learn, people can learn.\nLet me get this kind of really quick.\nSo what I'm trying to figure out is, you want this AI to construction site.\nSo we need to figure out why is it at the construction site.\nWell, let's say it's pushing towards the construction site.\nLet's say it's not.\nWe've already said he's there because you're really shocked.\nI don't know.\nNo, no, this person isn't necessarily tied to the construction.\nHe knows the instructions, talk to the constructions,\nhe can inform players about the construction.\nBut he's interested in the social maintenance.\nHe's not interested in the construction maintenance.\nIt's respected.\nYou're getting stuck again.\nYou're getting stuck on our ward and not on trying to get away.\nOK.\nWhy is he talking to this guy?\nIs he talking to the guy?\nBecause he wants to spot on the construction.\nOr is this a passing conversation?\nHe's, he's, the character, the player, the player talking to the guy, right?\nYeah, but you need to figure out what is the intent of the conversation.\nOK, the intent of the conversation.\nLet's, let's, so the two bodies, the two bodies, intent wise.\nOK, so imagine.\nBut no, this is what you want to ask, right?\nNo, so, what I'm, I'm trying to get you to focus on these two people.\nI need you to figure out why they're having the conversation.\nWhat is the purpose of the conversation?\nI'm trying to explain that.\nI don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't.\nWhy they get there?\nOK, and how, so what they're, what they're about.\nWhat they're, what they're about.\nWe're worried about the point of the conversation.\nIntent, right?\nIntense, what you want to know, isn't it?\nYes or no?\nSo I want to know what the AI wants out of this conversation.\nconversation. The AI is the player. The player wants to have freedom. The player wants to have body.\nBut the player wants to have a goal for the conversation right now. We're talking about the conversation.\nOkay, they're talking to someone. Okay. Oh, we haven't established foundation yet. We can't build that yet.\nYeah, we don't know what the fuck they're talking about. They're trying to figure out.\nWell, we're going to go back to the foundation then. Alright.\n\n\n====== REC014.txt ======\nOkay, let's say we got established characters. Where's the seniors over there?\nWell, that's not the CD, but let's just a other side. It's not all right. Where's it at?\nAlso, we'll back the office. Yeah, I'm like that\nThis paper, okay\nOkay, so you need to figure out what is the trivial conversation between the AEI and the engineer whoever it is\nSo I think we need to establish we need to establish characters first before we can actually establish the way they interact with each other\nRemember these two are close\nWell, but okay, so yeah, we have to we have to we have to we have to explain the social context, right?\nWe need this this this player knows this player that we can we can add details like this relationship to close our relationship to co-work card and relationship to\nWell, so does this engineer?\nThis engineer knows them\nBy name, but they don't know them personally. He knows them in passing. Yeah, okay, so then we need just the engineer's name\nMarry this kind of getting in she is\nMarry him\nSo more it is in the room, so what would happen when she so she just came into the room when she's been in the room for a while\nShe this is later on she interaction passing. No, I mean Jake. She's coming to give the player\nMore means to interact\nLike joke of the players. Yeah, so\nWhole goal isn't to come to talk to the people\nOkay, so now we have whole goals the interact with the AEI saw that the city had that she talked to anyone in there and wondered if the sources of its greatness\nMyself I pictured all the splendors of an issue to come when she comes in that he talked to anyone\nNot a son\nBecause if she's coming to the door she would automatically see this process\nSo she greeted them she gets them\nShe knows\nCardin personally, but she doesn't know Kalesa\nOkay, so she was just getting from an informal greeting then\nInform a greeting. Yeah, she's she she\nGenose in my name all of my name, but she doesn't she knows some people more than others\nBut there's still not an extreme connection. You get buried in detail right now. Okay, yeah in personal\nNot personally, but not rudely casually. My hands are just more. Hello. Hello. What's up guys?\nSo she does she talked to anyone else in the room because we got a paint\nFrom what the player is going to see so the player they probably noticed them coming to the room\nLet's say cardin Cardin knows her well. So he comes up and he's uh he's\nKind of giving context for conversation\nLike what she's doing. She that intro they had to be able to\nEstablish a foundation of knowledge. So Ryan knows a lot Cardin knows a little. They're both interesting subject\nBoth talking about the subject of the player\nGetting a body, but that's just passing. It's not like\nLittle bit here in their little information. Not too much\nLike that is that is the main conversation. What's up? You're working on this. Oh, that's cool\nHow would you do how would you write that\nWhat do we? Well, dialogue wise. How would you write the interaction? How would you?\nSo can the player here?\nWe'll just describe the scene and then describe the talking the player can't hear\nUm\nThey can hear they can see they can't talk yet. Okay, so what perspective do you want it to be described for?\nUh, you're the player camera. Okay, so then what he would see is he would see the door open\nUh, she would come in\nShe would give her greeting to the person in the seat because there's no names yet\nSo he'd see that have a short conversation and then he would come over and approach\nShe'd probably wave to him just because he said that they were social species\nAnd then he would probably be to hold back and probably to his side\nSo he wouldn't see the engineer from the front. He would see probably over left shoulder\nComing over whole shoulder. She would probably see\nHis right arm right shoulder and head\nOkay, and then we have to figure out what is the next sequence that she told him to the AI or just she keep talking to Karen\nCollison or\nMariam\nOh, I need to write, I need to run this now\nSo let's say Mariam. Well, don't put it in the scene yet because we'll figure out a little path right now\nWell, I'll put it over here. I'm sure it's not the scene yet. This is this is before. This is\nSo we don't we know she exists. Okay, so we don't need to put it again\nSo I want to wait till we figure out when she interacts with the player so we know what a place\nBecause both she's a whole path she takes\nAfter this conversation is going to decide how much of the room the player sees at this side\nreal\nUm\nSo let's say\nLooking\nSo they they kind of have\nClissa in their far three of you over here\nAs easy as to a cone\nYeah, I'm trying to do a cone. It's just you got to\nStabbers\nSo that's a big camera then it's not our traditional Soko camera. It's more of a path Soko\nOr should I make it smaller shape? I produced a few of this. So\nMost off the field of view is going to decide the shape of the camera. I'm all focused food reviews a smaller camera\nOr a smaller lens as I should say a wider view is a wider lens. Let's say you pronounce like this\nSo it's just like almost like a light bulb then\nYeah\nSo then you know what you should do then what I would do is if I was you had have it wake up as she comes into the room\nAnd then\nHave a focus on home immediately\nHave hope have the camera follow the action. Well the camera is the player their full action and so I'm trying to use\nHuman biology. So the human eye is good at catching movement on the side\nUm\nOn the on the corner of their eye in the far area. So if you have movement over here on the screen\nPleasure like well, what is that? Yeah, but this is this is where we work\nNo, this is the closer moves\nSo they look lightweight and then they look over here to see marine come in. No, I know, but I'm not talking about them right now\nI'm telling my woman\nWomen's over there too, but you know what I'm talking about is have her come in\nTalk to these two so the player follows it and then when she waves just make the players for you follow that way\nIt's cool. Okay, imagine this\nImagine they're all reading they don't know when it's gonna wake up. Yeah\nSo they're all reading throughout the reading they're talking but then\nImagine the player wandering the space and then the first person they talk to\nSo you guys it's awake and they're awake under the space. Oh, they're just they're just think like a little\nA series as seed they're a seed, right? And this is their sparkling\nOkay, but if they haven't woken up yet, they can't be exploring the space. No, there are\nThere this is when they do a wake up and in marine comes a little bit after this\nSo the player gets to explore first and then marine comes a little little later\nThis is the first interaction right you have\nWhoever's talked to you first they interact they try like they say they say they give a little\nLower context world context the player interact anyway. They want so how can they they can I can I someone says can I pet you and you go like yeah\nAnd then you press yes or no and then they okay, you know\nBecause they recognize this person as being they recognize this this being as\nA person or one\nMaybe you would have to figure out that that's a person. No, they they know they know that these things can become conscious\nBut there's very few of them. No, I'm talking about from the seeds aspect\nJust see from the seeds perspective does it realize this is a different organism?\nNo\nI know it\nDoesn't have conversation yet. Okay, so you don't you don't have conversation until you\nWhen you get here, but you can you can you can interact a little more in the time of conversation like talk about when it looks at it\nDoes it realize that this is something different or does it look at it and just see something\nUh, I think you're the you're so these seeds\nBy themselves apart from the player\nOkay, uh as a thing in there's just the rules and you just throw because I'm thinking from the point of the this perspective so\nEight-Eye in themselves\nYou don't know their intent\nOkay, but you don't but they're perspective, right? They\nThey interact curiously that's all I can do\nThey can't do anything deal with what I just asked though. I don't even perceive they they is not a thing they know\nThey is not a thing they they they have\nIt's just so that they interact curiously\nWith the right for the player though\nFor the sake of the player you need to realize that they're going to be forming stuff in their head already\nWell, that's what the player is doing automatically. That's okay\nBut based on how you have that camera is going to affect how that player perceives himself in this world\nBecause he says you wanted a head height\nYeah, about about player height like by default they're up here. They're they're little\nYeah, they're offset just to be average. So I'm trying to figure out the like the body of it itself\nIt doesn't have about it yet. It's just okay. So let me try to try it. So how is it up here though?\nIf it's a small object, how is it going to be a\nIt's attached to the wall. So imagine it being like head height\nLike right here, maybe so it's not it's when you said they're going to be going around the room\nYeah, they like a style you can read that you motion about she getting away the body\nBut you move in like a character\nNo, how do you people in so you said he doesn't know he's what he is yet, right?\nLeft stick. Okay, I'm not asking what I'm saying. Okay, okay, if he's coming out of the wall\nIt means he has a spot where he's coming out of which means if he comes out for enough and then turns back\nYou see you see the body you see the body. Yeah, you see what it's connecting to the wall. Yeah, okay\nThat's a huge point. You have to get the feet per se or a tail or a\nI\nA string. I don't know. We're just so there's a certain length you get the connection\nOkay, so some trying to figure out we've got to figure out it's a great motion for that room because if he can't just have it\nLeave the corner and go around the whole room if it's a snake\nPeople are gonna have to walk through what it's going\nWell, let's just imagine that they're they're nice about it. They they'll look like oh\nYou know, we'll see that some trying to figure this because we got to figure out\nYou're trying to avoid because it's a rigid object\nSo the problem is I've noticed you're getting hooked on one perspective\nYou're right and we're trying to fill in at five we have to write percent of the time into it\nYou're trying to establish information. So I gave you the respect of the player\nand the respect of the AI and now we're working the perspective of kalesa marian\nrule met\nerasai\nand sorral\nWell, so the other two don't know this is happening yet. So right now we'll only focus on the three in the front\nOkay\nSo the player can wander out one of three directions\nThree because because it's a game they can nickname they can have interactions like you can interact with kalesa you interact with cardon\nYou can touch a moment and\nTheir interactions with the player differ\nRight? Okay, Wilman. Hey, the uh the\nIt's awake or they're awake or it's awake. It reads it. I don't know if you want to make a little more rude\nUh, it doesn't it be real. It's just it is good. Oh, yeah, you're right. So let's say hey, it's up\nHey guys, it's up and this guy says\nuh\nOh, hey, hey, you're up, buddy. Hi\nUm, this will maybe he's like uh\nPlaces like hey, they're up\nYou know or you can have uh\nUh, I don't really have you have different expressions of the dialogue\ndifferent expressions of the character in that short little beat of info beat of information\nHow long is this scene supposed to last?\nUh, that's the first interaction you have and then there's a\nsmaller interaction throughout that so\nNow if you interact with kalesa cardon will come and they'll interact together will map work on that comment\nHe'll wander in\nYou know he'll come in this space you you have a little time to speak with these guys\nAnd then will not come in or you can speak the moment for a long time\nGood chunk of time before these two guys\nSo how would they notice if you next to them you wake up\nLike how wouldn't they notice?\nWell, they're talking to each other. They don't remember they don't they don't and they know it's gonna wake up, but they're not\nJust said those emotion. Yeah, they have a tail and you gotta go across the room. We're gonna see\nWell, it's okay. Let's set an obstruction. That's like six feet long going across. Let's say they notice like right over here\nLike well, hey, it's up, you know\nUm to this point will be a little\ninteraction point\nAt a turning point in the air\nSo and then a wake on a wake\nTP for turning point\nUm\nI\nUm\nAnd then really comes in that this is TP one trigger one if you if you study with that direction\nThis is TP two\nLet's see you see how you callissa\nSo while I'm talking is I'm forced to the conversation length that you would have for the guy in the back\nHmm\nYou said if you talked about that force you'd have a normal conversation. Why would it be different than if you talked to the other's force?\nHe's not as\ncurious\nBut he's not as\nIntensive curious as they are. He's he's more interested. But why would it be him? You talking to them force the fact that the conversation if I'm letting\nI'm waiting. I don't know. I'm an idiot. Um\nThese guys\nThey interact quickly and move the dialogue quickly this guy if you the players more curious the longer\nYou know, they'll explore the room and then\nYou're after you talk to these guys\nYou can explore this but they they they can explore this place further and then talk to him\nOkay, but when you force describe that you said if they go to room and force they get a little conversation please out of them\nImagine if we have to have time we have an interval here because this is getting confusing because I think that\nI don't know maybe it's we have to write a time on actual time on events\nOf main events also trying to figure out the timeline soon\nWell, I think I can try better for have like uh\nThis event this this these two branching events. We don't need to write it all down yet, but we don't even have a fluid one for me now\nWell, you want the main events that for so long time to figure out is just come out of the wall\nWhat what I said has nothing to do with any of this what I'm asking is you told me on the force run through this\nAnd when he gets here you would have a longer conversation than if he went here for us\nwhy\nConversation and I think that was\nMiss bookend because you can't have conversation. No, I mean, but why would your interaction be longer down here than if you've done them\nWhat does he talk about philosophy and art?\nHe's guys talk about science. Why would his he talked less if you went to that post\nHe's not as socially inclined\nHe's not as intensely curious if these guys are easy. Okay, so let me try to explain this very quick\nSo you said if he cuts to him post you get a longer interaction than if you want to and then to him\nSo what is that difference\nWhy does going to them when you go to hand cut his interaction down\nWhat if you just made them same length interaction just uh because if this is if this is too\nOut there then no\nI have to figure out\nSo I'm just trying to figure out the chain of events because if we have him waking up we have the engineer coming eventually\nWe need to describe why\nIf so what you were saying were always if you talk to them it would show the interaction of them is because the engineer is coming in I think we need to establish more characters\nI think we're focusing too far we're going too far in the story and because we don't we don't know them yet\nWe don't know their interactions. You don't know how they interact. Well, this is how we do so we need to build the interaction post\nBefore we put what they're interacting with we need to build that interaction so we know what it looks like. Okay. Okay\nWell you just track it. I can you up to this point. Can you better? Can you better articulate the idea?\nI know the objective is you haven't told me what it is. It will be objective. They're curious and they'll interact in different way\nImagine a symbol of curiosity about to go overhead. Okay, so\nI'm trying to figure out when the engineer comes in\nWhen the engineer comes in\nOkay, so that's okay. So first\nAnd then they have curiosity that these two of curiosity is not interested\nSo what I'm trying to get is you can use the engineer as a break in the interaction you can use the engineer\nTo make the player interactive whichever one he did in the first time\nOh, I see it. Okay, hang on\nBecause he's not an inactive everyone at once. He's gonna have to pick one of the other first\nWell, I mean, it's more of a\nYou watch the character interact interact with each other, but he can't actually interact\nHe can't interact with them, but only when he's in the space with them\nI know but he's gonna have to eventually pick one to store with he can't interact with both at the same time\nWell, as it works out is you interact with Galisa, right?\nAnd then\nCardin comes in he talks automatically\nYou talk to Cardin then Galisa comes in and she talks automatically. It's more of a\nintroductory and then\nsomeone comes in and then cardin leads the conversation and then you interact with Galisa\nGalisa leaves the conversation and then cardin jumps in and then he's going to sort of if you go to world moment\nWhen it talks to you\ntalks philosophy a little bit talks hard or maybe you just says something interesting like\nI don't know if you want me to get into it\nNo, you're awake\nI don't know the characters\nSo here's what I'm trying to figure out is you gotta\nSo when you're the player you have to convey a path because no matter what there's only a limited amount of paths they can take\nIt's like you said they can either go\nHere or they can go to here\nSo we need to establish is\nIf he takes one how do we incentivize on that cure?\nOr advice was okay\nWell, let's say that so what I was thinking I'm doing is let's say you just want interaction\nOh, okay, the engineer comes in and then they can bounce off so light is actually they can bring people\nUh, interesting to space. So imagine as you start out this room this this entrance right and drive\nThis entryway\nWe're just in the building right now\nThis entryway is is dark\nThere are two lights here, but they're off right now\nSo the player interests the space and they they come around they like\nThey uh look at the window, you know, wow, this is really cool\nBut uh and then they recognize it as three space\nThey're come back and they're the bathroom. They see themselves. They go out and then your hands are available\nYou can like we're going around you can press\nR2 and L2 to see your hands only when you go to the bathroom. Yeah, you can see your hands then and then um\nUh\nAre you you're suddenly give yourself hands your hands kind of like wow?\nYou know, uh almost like you don't have to describe shocks me\nOkay, anyway um\nFrom there the player comes back out because they've explored the space to explore bathroom\nOkay, it's interesting enough to come out and you look in the window you look a lot and they're trying to look in the office\nYou can't see anything so you kind of move out um and then\nUh\nMarianne comes in she steps to the door the lights are on now that we draw the players attention to walls\nMaybe the lights are dimmer in the overall room\njust to further draw their attention to\nSo the wall is front and front of them\nMarianne comes in clissa and\nUh cardin interact will let stays aside to the far right\nHe's still reading his book. He's uninterested\nOr will then I should say cardin and uh clissa interact and they talked uh marian\nSo why not just share well met out of it then she's not going to be having an interaction\nHmm\nBecause you don't want to throw too much at the player at once. No, I do think they should interact with each other\nI think that that's why he's he's there. He's a character. You recognize he exists\nBut he's not interested. This is not throwing too much. This is avoiding throwing too much player\nI'm keeping her to the side\nBut he's still there. He's still waiting for therapy. He's still his relevance\nHis relevance is he's he's he needs therapeutic help and he's waiting for his his turn in line\nOkay, so he doesn't care for so is then he wouldn't necessarily interact with the draw\nBut he does he recognizes it is social space. He recognizes this thing is there. It's going to uh scrout today or some soon something soon\nUm and they come and check out about him and then\nUh\nColisell or cardin to be texted text uh marian like hey, I got your text\nSo it's up, huh? So they have a way to text each other\nThey have one interact and I maybe we use AR or I don't know, but there's there's a means that she found\nLet's say she does pick her phone and text real quick\nWell, or she can text and text and text each other. We don't need to say I know how to say each other\nWe just need to know that she got a message\nSee you're getting so full detail\nAll right, you're right number. We're trying to keep the bare bones right now\nSo all you need to have is the interaction is they the AI woke up\nIt's now exploring the room they now notice so now they contact her somehow\nSo now she's on the way\nNow we got to figure out what is a woman doing while they're talking and watching the AI\nIs the interacting with the AI or is he ignoring it for the most part\nWhat I'm trying to figure out is does he break off\nWhat he's doing to talk to the AI or do we make the player come to him\nBecause that's going to shape the narrative because if he has to come in\nBut that means maybe when Marin comes in he comes into a conversation. They're having\nBorses if he had stayed here and then Marin comes in this immediately\nWe'll let the two's over here. He doesn't actually go come over here. He stays in his little corner\nHe's sitting in chair reading. No, I'm talking about another branching point for you. Okay another breath. Okay, so\nWe give the player the choice because he doesn't have to talk to him. Yeah, so let's say the player doesn't and Marin comes through\nIf\nIf we have it if he doesn't talk Marin immediately turns to the sprout and addresses it\nBut maybe if the player has decided to come over here\nWhen he comes up this way\nMarin's having a conversation\nOh, I see what you mean. There's okay. So potential. Okay. If you announce will let because you want to have action\nWell the player isn't because it's a real world\nIt's interesting to freeze because he's not there. Yeah, you're right. So that's good\nWhat if the player attracts a moment when it comes to join the group if you interact with well not even room it comes to join the group when the player is interacting\nMarin arrives the player gets a chocolate to this area\nWhen the player comes up. It's intentional. Okay, you got to be drawing the intent here is to draw the player\nYeah, well, I'm trying to just give you different ways to run this scene\nBecause you want to have different branches in the same scene\nLet's just say you cross touch to a minute and then you can go from a moment\nTo here or something you have will make be the trigger\nBecause the player doesn't have to talk to women to go to the bathroom. No, no, but there's the ones straight across the desk\nYeah, well they can just go like\nIf they really wanted to\nSo what I'm saying is if you have them talk to will make reward them with a conversation these\nForces that if you had it will they went to the office and went back to the main conversation. Yeah\nBecause then once they realize that maybe not on the force playthrough, but on the second if they choose different choices\nIt shows them that there's narrative built into the world\nAnd so incentivizes them to explore more\nIt also incentivizes them to play it again because then they need to figure out when and actions and that's the first time\nThat's brilliant dude\nThat's a great great first time. Oh shit. Okay, um, all right. How do we do that to me on the force scene?\nOh\nYou played them all the times. Fuck now. I played it once and then I watched my streamer my streamer when he did it\nMake different choices and he was able to convince them so I just shot the chairman in the face\nOh, dude, I I talked everyone, but in the end there's only two choices. No, so I mean that's what I meant\nIt sucks. I took the power. No, there's no choice. You can't you can't kill them. No, there's a thought choice\nIf you go to the golden you take the power regulator from home\nYou go back to the city you talk to him and you talk about the food\nYou can convince him to step down\nShe moves in takes over the colony and you're ending what the fuck talks about how they get off of salt tuna\nAnd the colony becomes independent because they grow their own food. Oh, shit\nYeah, my streamer did this and I was like what the fuck all because he clipped on an extra dialogue line that I had\nBut I ignored on my bridge, which one is that which one triggered it? So you have to\nTake the power regulator from the botanical golden\nYou take it when you take it after the quest\nWell, no, you have to do the quest where you get power to edgewater and you take the power regulator out of the botanical golden\nYou talk to whore. So I gave it I gave it to the pianist for council dargette\nOh, see you can't do it then you have to take it and give it to the city. Oh, and then you can then you talk to whore\nYou can she explains why did you do this and you tell her I needed the regulator she gets pissed off\nThis is my playthrough. I went back and I took the money\nBut when you go back to him that you get a dialogue option\nTo talk about the food and the disease because if you talk to the mayor\nHe talks about how the villagers out of the town have a plague\nAnd you find out there's a plague born into the town if he talked to okay. We're gonna call the people\nI made a choice. I'm game it and if you do that you can actually make them unite together\nAh, it was damn because what happens is you explain but I was so close. I took the wrong one\nI thought I thought I thought I thought I was literally one conversation piece away, but I was in a hurry so I skipped it\nBut literally all you have to do is go talk about the food and eventually it breaks off a path\nWell, he's not talking about nutrition. I built a doctor dude. I built a head high intelligence. Hi\nI uh mechanical skill like I don't dialogue heavy, you know\nHe convinced me on intimidating and but I did all the interactions, right? I was like yeah\nDoing right doing great and then suddenly there's this choice. I'm like\nWell, can I can they work together? Can they get that little my streamline is can I make them work together?\nBut you you have to do it immediately you can't do it gradually\nI thought I could I thought I could convince them talk to them more\nLike hey, why don't you join these guys or hey? Hey, I can talk to the citizens of the city like hey\nWhy don't you guys join us here? I can help you we can we can we can work to develop to build we can work work\nWe can work together to develop a community. Oh, so I know so you can't go that far\nYou can't interact that no show the brainwash. You got a number. No, I mean you can't. They're not right. They don't they've talked to bartender\nShe's wonderful\nEveryone is I'm talking about the workers. Oh, no, everyone there is a nice thing. They should be real people for the knot. No, no, so\nThey're more on that phone the game. Have you I got the ship? Have you got some more? Okay? I know when you get some more\nYou find out that the board\nRuns propaganda campaigns and it tells the citizens what to think\nThose are religion call the scientific OSI. Wait, do you think if I come back to the sit to that clamped pilot later? It'd be different\nUm, do you think they'll be able to help anyway? It changes your narrative at the end of the game\nSo if they go back there, there's gonna be stock their aesthetic. Well, no\nSo at the end of the game it does what followed the legacy will went to each place you went and it explains your interaction and how it affected it\nSo on mine because I talked to him. I told him look. He pushed for people to hold they left because you're an asshole\nHe got softer on them. He got realistic and\nThey became more productive. They became happier. They became a happy town. How the shit? How do I get him? I missed that too. What the fuck?\nNo, so what I did is I took the power from the botanical godans one to the two\nLittins convinced them both to come back so everyone else came back\nAdelaide stayed by herself in the godans. Everyone knows move back to town\nAnd then when I talk to the mayor of Thompson Rude, I sort of look you're pushing the people to hold if you don't fix it\nThey're gonna do this again and next time we're gonna fix it\nAnd so he realizes okay, I've been pushing too hard\nAnd he pulls back a little bit on them and then in my ending playthrough it talks on my city was happy. I'm gonna re-play the game now\nI can't I can't I can't just look at those two forces doesn't know the quest that does the same thing that I've got on accident\nI know but I gotta redo it because I want to see that ending\nNo, I mean halfway through the game. There's another quest that does this\nI didn't realize it. I found it on accident\nHe was a binary choice and by fucking around and talking to him. I made them come to an agreement\nI pretty much said look I can just kill you both\nOr you can walk together or I can take one\nAnd it was something like okay, we'll come doing the code I guess\nBecause that's what I told the guy. I'm like look I have enough weapons\nI could kill your whole town and then go kill the other one\nSo you guys come doing the code or I'll check this out\n\n\n====== REC015.txt ======\nThere's a difference when conversation, then if you have it, no one shows up.\nAlso, if we have it, and then someone opens the door, we pause.\nAnd then the conversation restores, typically it picks back up, but sometimes it restores\nbased off of what that door pulls and drinks.\nSo they used to say, well, I hope...\nWell, don't really do it so boldly, because we have to figure out who will\nthe player interact with, and at what time, because we've got to build the sequence of events.\nI think that we can do that, but it's got to be like this, and it's got to be gradual.\nNo, but I'm talking about four stories, one you can also dress, draw, talk down,\nor you'll get tired of it.\nYeah, so I'm trying to guess.\nSo I'm going to...\nYou're going to put this one in the middle, so we know that this is our main piece of action\nthat we're discussing.\nWe're discussing, as I'm in this room, but also the tower around us.\nSo, because that's the thing, is you kind of want to build the wall.\nSo the thing is, I want you to get this context, because this is the doughnut where you see it.\nYou're just going to imagine there's something here.\nImagine that the swarm of...\nOh, so that's not something you're explaining to us.\nThat's what I'm sorry about.\nI need its ports in there.\nSo the doughnut.\nSo the diced swarm of stars.\nThey're making these doughnuts, and they're setting towards the center of the gas.\nOkay, but...\nAnd they gather them gathering in a large net.\nSo that would affect these people right now.\nBut we do need to explain that.\nBut you might want to put that in your back pocket for a second.\nOkay.\nBecause you're able to play, it was just like you got to room...\nRight, I'm going to fire out around like that, you're right.\nSo I need to...\nWe're not that you're going before.\nYou're going to see this.\nBecause you got to envision yourself walking behind the plate of the whole gas.\nSo you have to figure out what are the details you need to cover, what are the details you need to see.\nBecause we don't need to throw everything at them right now.\nWe want to kind of see what's along for them as we go.\nBut that's what I had.\nThat's what was sort of...\nBecause this is giving us a way to make the interact...\nThis is not working.\nThis is not...\nI mean, it's scale-wise.\nIt works, but we need to be focusing up here, right?\nNo.\nNo, you do this.\nBecause this is all gathered throughout the fight again.\nBut you're not using the entire gas.\nNo, but we're using it as a framework for the narrative.\nOkay.\nBecause if all they know is this galaxy in that single store...\n...it's not supposed to be in the world.\nWe're just trying to build the narrative and then we'll have to figure out what we want.\nRight now, it's kind of like building a puzzle.\nWe don't need all the pieces in the exact order they need to go.\nWe just need to get the pieces up right now.\nThere's two of the pieces.\nThe four contacts would be the map that you're going to figure.\nSo...\nSo here's what I'm trying to...\nHere's what I'm trying to explain of this.\nThere isn't everything.\nAll we're doing is trying to flesh out the boundary lines of all the little story right now.\nNo, I got that.\nI understand that.\nThis is...\nNo, this is to me.\nNo, let's say nobody could add a dead in them with the sticky notes.\nThat's true.\nOkay.\nSo, imagine that for contacts...\n...skill, really.\nLet's say that...\nWe don't really need to worry about that.\nLet's say that this...\n...just heard kind of...\n...visual contacts.\nThis is the...\n...atmosphere.\nOkay.\nSo, this is the...\nThis is the four-way view.\nThis is the top-down view.\nWhat the cities look like.\nThis is the Galaxy view.\nAnd this is the real-world story.\nSo, the next one we need to build is the construction area, well...\n...AEI, the player.\nAnd the person is going to be...\n...and then they'll path to that area.\nBecause I don't forget, we're also going to build into paths.\nWe're out.\nOkay.\nSo, we need that as well to explore that.\nHow much space do you think we should have to be okay?\nImagine the hub being somewhere here.\nSo, we don't really need to...\nNo, if you want to build a map, like Dirtual's map.\nThis is the 3D slice.\nRemember, you want to talk about this.\nYou want to get this layout, right?\nI just want to put paths.\nHey, lumbars, I'm not going to get it.\nYou're cruising games.\nNo, what I mean is...\nWhat I'm talking about is...\n...you suddenly don't have vehicles to build.\nIt's literally going to space a little further.\nSo, when you build your map, consider that in mind...\n...the way of moving around.\nThat's what I was trying to figure out.\nBecause that's going to change the narrative of when the person can...\n...marry and walk into the city...\n...we're using the charm to the city.\nIt's going to control the narrative...\n...because both taking a track...\n...was his walking.\nYou're going to notice more walking than if you're taking a track...\n...on a track, maybe more folks than the conversation.\nBut when you walk, you focus on the destination and the conversation.\nBecause if they're on a track, they're just going to be buzzing by still.\nOkay, so, watch the destination of VBN.\nDestination is the answer.\nThey're working towards exploring the area.\nThey want to.\nThey want to turn it on to explore Marin and the AEI...\n...specifically destination after they leave the office.\nWhere are they going?\nOh, okay. So, let's say that...\nThe player is planning with that.\nThe player has a body now.\nAnd so, they've been sent to...\nThey've found a way to...\n...capoeil where they go.\nWhere are they going?\nShe's going to build him legs.\nBuild them...build them legs.\nSo, kind of a level doesn't have legs.\nThe player doesn't have legs.\nThey're being carried by this character.\nSo they're being carried?\nIs the character walking or taking a vehicle?\nThey're walking with some stabilization equipment.\nSo then that's going to alter the narrative.\nYou're going to be either facing outwards from them,\nseeing ahead, or you're going to be facing ahead.\nWhat if you were playing a little set of wheels,\nmaking me look around now?\nOkay, so she's bright and temporary legs.\nSo where are they going?\nThey've changed our buildings.\nShe's going to workshop.\nOkay, so we'll describe the path to a workshop.\nIs it far beyond the idea of why you need to be straight?\nIs it busy?\nIs there traffic on it?\nIs there other people that are going to be acting?\nWhat are some of the significant things that are going to be locked in the past?\nIs it going to be construction, tower, buildings?\nIs it going to be like, go ahead and do something to be home?\nWhat is the area she's walking through?\nIs it in dust or oil?\nIs it in the dead show?\nWhere is it over towards the base?\nIt's basically just a statue.\nSo, can I do it here?\nSo, about the structure being as it is,\nit's pretending on the space,\nbecause I don't know if it works.\nSo, here's a question.\nDoes she have stairs to the office?\nOr is that a flat path for the main entrance?\nDoes she have stairs?\nShe has stairs.\nThere she's above the main area.\nI imagine there's a little shop down here.\nOh, so there's another interaction place.\nSo, great.\nTrigger plundry.\nShe or her home is down here.\nSo, I don't know.\nWhat?\nTrigger plundry.\nSo, this is another interaction.\nSo, we have two interactions right here.\nShe has to put on the new legs.\nSo, this is going downstairs.\nThis is to downstairs the bottom.\nYeah, but you said she has wheels.\nSo, I mean, she has to carry them down with stairs.\nSo, let's say that there's...\nThey plan for it.\nSo, this thing is not actually a wheel.\nIt's like a...\nOh, so, it can adapt to stairs.\nYeah.\nSo, it can adapt down.\nIt's adaptive.\nOkay.\nSo, then, what we need, then,\nall the trigger plundry we have,\nthen it's opening the legs onto the body.\nYeah.\nThe reason is...\nSo, let's write that down on some of the view.\nBecause that's important,\nbecause that is a break in action,\nwhere we can force into the dialogue\nto keep the player busy,\nwhile not involving the player.\nYou shift the camera view\nso the player knows of those motions,\nand then you have them talk\nlike she's setting it up,\nor asking questions,\nmaybe ask questions about the legs.\nSo, that way the player knows what's going on.\nOkay.\nSo, because you said the player can talk.\nIf the player was forward,\nthis is a...\nPoint.\nIt's notation.\nIt's notation A.\nI need to explain the...\nWhat?\nThe rock will start through the sand,\nand follow up.\nAnd here I saw with joy\nwhat seemed to promise further traces of the ending.\nWell, this here's what I'm trying to figure out.\nQ will be on the face of the people in view.\nWith an unscathed both the sides\nof several small swathed areas\nof the ancient world.\nThose interiors, my concern,\nis watching these two talks.\nThose swathes come into long,\nsince they're asked to fit on,\nand then she's interacting with the sand.\nI would have them interact\nand go and smash open the door\nand ask them to give me.\nBut I cleaned one with my spade,\nand there's no one to waste them.\nThey're the ones that I received,\nor at least one of them.\nMaybe you don't have those outside,\nso only have I received...\nI think I missed both of them out,\nand I'm going to use them.\nIs that what they said on the back?\nIs that a chick that's coagusted, though?\nWhat's going on?\nPillers, insects.\nYou want to back them?\nSeriously?\nNo, tell me about this.\nNo, they're talking.\nThere's no such a new door here.\nNo, I know there's a basket here.\nYou don't need to see that.\nI'm talking about the tricky door here.\nI had an invisible door.\nIt's like a hallway.\nBut the solutions have an open door,\nso there's no such thing.\nFor I can hardly read the needle up,\nto this area, if it was locked here,\nor it's a door.\nIt's a door.\nOkay, but what would that be?\nIt's a door.\nThis is a house.\nWhy would it still be all such jizzies?\nForgotten rights.\nIt's a chair floor.\nIt's a floor.\nIt's an inexplicable niche.\nOkay, but just trying to talk more about it.\nOkay, but if we're in here,\ntalk.\nThere wouldn't have anything open.\nNo, no, it's a place.\nAll that the place can be.\nI'll try to keep the clothes for her.\nI find what the other two are.\nSo there's a clarius trap to you.\nWhat I'm saying to show the office, they don't think I can see me in the other floor right now.\nI'm talking about some work about this from the long moon campus.\nThe fire was on the back.\nShe's installing the legs.\nIn the twilight.\nThere's another aperture coming to the real cold.\nIt's like finding more vague stones as symbols.\nBecause we need to convey the motion happening around.\nSo we know what the interaction is.\nWe're not going to have someone screaming if it's a constant scene.\nThere you go.\nYes, I'm calm.\nJust action.\nDo you want me to shoot?\nAbout the shrine that's crying.\nWhen the noise of a wind and of my camel outside open the stones.\nAnd drew me forth to see why I put his fright in the beast.\nWhat are you trying to do?\nThe moon is moving vividly over the planet.\nSo it's close to the Earth instead of blowing on the shield by a strong wind.\nAnd decreasing wind from some point along the cliff ahead.\nI knew it was this chilly sand.\nYou figure it out.\nWhat are you doing?\nI was about to leave it in place.\nThe same as the cardboard is back.\nI changed it.\nYes.\nAnd saw that there was no wind on top of it.\nThis is stung.\nIt made me fearful.\nAnd I immediately recall the sudden local winds I had seen and heard before.\nSome rise and suns it.\nAnd judged it was a normal thing.\nI also have twilight inside of this museum.\nI decided that some rock fisher leading to a cave.\nAnd watched the troubled sand to trace it to its source.\nSoon proceeding that it came from the black orifice of the temple\na long distance south that we almost out of sight.\nLet me see how you describe it.\nThe shadow of the sand clout I planted toward this temple.\nYes.\nWhich I'm interested in, right?\nThe larger than the rest.\nAnd showed a door way far away.\nThat's what I'm trying to explain.\nWe need sand.\nOr sand.\nIt's a woman door into the door.\nSuch as you see it just told me.\nBecause maybe we have the person in the living signal.\nAnd so there is a strange ingredient.\nIt goes with the toilet as an excuse.\nThey see it.\nThey see the thing.\nAnd they see a woman goes to the back.\nThey don't know what's back there.\nBut they see something back there.\nBut the presence.\nBecause that's when they come back to that office later on in the game.\nThey know to go to that back room.\nBut you didn't tell them to go to the bathroom.\nWell, you showed them.\nI was more afraid than I could explain.\nYou're right.\nBut when you're in the game, you're going to have visual in a walkway.\nSo we don't want to put everything down or down.\nOkay.\nWhat we're trying to do is just paint a loose portrait of a sequence of events.\nSo then we can go to narrow it.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nSo, okay.\nBefore you start tearing up more sheets from that small one,\nwe've got to use these cycles.\nSo we've got to use the ones we got.\nOkay.\nSorry.\nYou think they're going to find more paper for this shit.\nIt's like six months of book.\nI have so many.\nI have so many.\nYes.\nThis one.\nI know you know, someone had ideas.\nBut we've got to just stay focused on them.\nA little threat right now.\nAs you're getting to teleport.\nFocus back on what we were doing.\nSo many tangents.\nWe'll build it.\nI know.\nThat's why we're doing that.\nWe've got to build it.\nThat's where we're going to get to.\nJust slow the bit.\nThis is the slowest down.\nThat's why I made you jog the office.\nBecause it slows us down.\nIt knows we're dead.\nWe know we can't believe this office.\nOkay.\nSo we have to talk to the other soul.\nIt's just a joke.\nYou know we're not going to stop it.\nTo those remote areas when it's time to go to the office.\nBecause it slows us down.\nWe know we can't believe this office.\nOkay.\nSo we have to talk to the other soul.\nIt's just a joke.\nAnd I'm going to ask you now.\nTo those remote areas, this is what you're doing.\nIt's just a joke.\nWe're doing what we're doing.\nSo what we're doing is to have she's taking from the office\nsupport within.\nWe're holding a black tunnel.\nSo we're ready to try and get an entire schedule.\nI've got a little wrong map.\nThe only thing to see in these maps,\nwe just need to top down with the pouches from the tables.\nWe don't need to know everything on the path,\nor I can't even build that in the narrative.\nBut the path is also where we should rest in peace.\nAnd it is because I've been so busy.\nYou're jumping to your forehead.\nWe've got a build for most of these deaths,\nand then we'll build the awards.\nThere's need for the pouches going to box\nas it belongs to the desert from the land.\nSo that's what I mean.\nBefore we build the rest,\nwe've got to build a story for you.\nIt's like sketching before you pack.\nYou've got to do a slight sketch there.\nWe know what we're going to do.\nWe're not free-handing.\nWe're not free-handing.\nIt's a steep passage, feet first.\nThere's no one on that.\nLet's say to this thing.\nBecause only in the terrible weather,\nit doesn't have to be exact.\nIt just has to be something that can get us tough.\nWe're having a schedule, right?\nDon't worry about a schedule.\nWell, I have a narrow schedule.\nIt's part of what they're in,\nsome of the battles like us.\nBut right now,\nwe just need a path to the towards me,\nwhere the dots could not lie.\nThey were connected to the dots.\nWe're not drawing a picture where it's connected.\nI lost track of the art,\nand I never got to consult my wife,\nthough I was frightened.\nSo then now,\nwe just need a path that takes you to the workshop.\nThat we challenge as a direction,\nand of steepness.\nAnd once I came to a long,\nterrible passage,\nwhere I discussed this,\nafterwards,\nalong the rocky floor,\nholding my torch and arms,\nand I was beyond my head.\nThe place was not high enough.\nIt was the past straight after\nwhen we moved on with the steps.\nAnd I was still scrambling down,\ninterminably,\nwhen my failing torch died.\nIt was a bit of a nightmare.\nSo,\nis it going to be such a nightmare?\nIt was a nightmare.\nSo, when I did notice it,\nit was still holding it high.\nI mean,\nit was like,\nwrongly loose or cause,\nlike you would see in a conventional city,\nwhere his wife is on the road\nor benches in the end.\nSo,\nlong,\nlong,\nlong,\nhonest,\ndunes or fables.\nAnd one of the things happened happened.\nHere,\non that attic,\nthere,\nthere,\nI was lucky enough\nto think of something I musst\nfound when I discovered\nsomething which was\ndecorated with mud.\nWhy do you find that?\nDo I have a\ngood idea?\nCan you feel the moisture of my\nAll that back, those two were forced to use from one of the ones that were leaving the\narthas.\nWe don't even need all of them.\nSo all we need right now is the path she takes, the path that should be the full\ntrail.\nThis is how to, and then that's what I can solve the path, and the path is more, until I\nfeel it.\nSo now we just want to draw the path that she starts on, and it's like, well, the path is\nblack.\nThis is what we have a direction to roll with the head, so then we just don't even know\nwhat to do to see on this path.\nI'm looking to look at foot might pass down through that pasm I saw beneath, as far\nas vision could explore the jetty sides as smooth as glass, looking as if just varnished\nover with that dark pitch.\nOf course, really.\nIt's not that short.\nIt's more like a time and quite cease to exist when my feet are filled with the same\nopen.\nI'm not sure if it's like a place like this.\nI don't have the time to draw the exit from this, so we would calculate any far above\nmy head.\nI could not quite stand, but could kneel upright, and in the dark I shuffled and crept\nhere.\nThis is the first and second floor.\nI soon knew that I was in a narrow passage whose walls were lined with cases of one\nfloor, having glass fronts.\nAs in that paleozoic and the visible place I felt of such things as polished wooden glass,\nI shuddered at the possible implications.\nThe cases were apparently arranged along each side of the passage of regular intervals,\nand were oblong and horizontal, hideously like coffins in shape and size.\nWhen I tried to move to a three for further examination, I found they were firmly fastened.\nI saw that the passage was a long one, so floundered ahead rapidly in a creeping\nrun that would have seemed horrible at any eye-watched me in the blackness.\nCrossing from side to side occasionally to feel of my surroundings and be sure the walls\nand rows of cases still stretched on.\nMan is so used to thinking visually that I almost forgot the darkness and picture the endless\ncorridor of wooden glass in its low-studded monotony as though I saw it.\nAnd then, in a moment of indescribable emotion,\nI did see it.\nJust when my fancy merged into real sight, I cannot tell,\nbut there came a gradual glow ahead.\nAnd all at once I knew that I saw the dim outlines of the corridor and the cases\nrevealed by someone.\nSo when he started to smell this, he was in a pitch black fuss for us all the way.\nFor a little while, all those kinds of times I was in hope.\nHe saw a glass.\nYou can see it all as it is.\nHe saw a glass and it would head into the stronger light.\nI realized that my fancy had been but feeble.\nThis hall was no relic of crudity like the temples in the city above,\nbut a monument of the most magnificent and exotic art, rich, vivid,\nand daringly fantastic designs and pictures formed a continuous scheme of mural painting\nwhose lines and colours were beyond description.\nYou see, this is like that city.\nThis is one of a strange golden wood with fronts of exquisite glass\nand contained pieces of art.\nThis is the mother of five more beautiful creatures,\nand I was particularly impressed.\nThis is the most chaotic dreams of man.\nTo convey any idea of these monstrosities is impossible.\nThey were of the reptile kind.\nWith body lines suggesting sometimes the crocodile, sometimes the seal,\nbut more often nothing of which either the naturalist or the paleontologist ever heard.\nIn size they approximated a small man,\nand their forelegs bore delicate and evidently flexible feet,\ncuriously like human hands and fingers.\nAt strangest of all with their heads,\nwhich presented a contour of violating all known biological principles,\nto nothing can such things be well-compared.\nIn one flash I thought of comparisons as varied as the cat,\nthe bulldog, the mythic satyr,\nand the human being,\nnot drove himself at so colossal and protruded forehead,\nif the horns and the noselessness and the alligator-like jaw\nplaced the things outside all the established cannibals.\nI debated for a time on the reality of the monkeys,\nhalf-suspecting they were artificial idols,\nbut soon decided they were indeed some paleogen species,\nwhich had lived with the name of the city to live.\nTo crown their grotesqueness,\nmost of them were bortiously enrobed in the costliest of fabrics,\nand lavishly laid with ornaments of gold,\njewels, and unknown shining metals.\nThe importance of these crawling creatures must have been asked\nif they held first some of the wild designs on the frescoe.\nSo what would you think if you went to an ancient city?\nYou went down the tunnel for,\nyou don't know how long,\nyou were just in this pitch black tunnel,\ngoing down and down and down,\nand then you found that,\noh, it's just a path that you have to crawl on.\nSo now you're crawling on your hands and knees,\nyou don't know how long it is,\nyou can't see.\nIt's this pitch black,\nyou're feeling your way along,\nand it's a rough cut tunnel,\nand then suddenly you come to like,\nyou could tell it's been walk-stone.\nIt's chiseled.\nAnd then as you're going through this dark chiseled hole,\nyou still can't see anything,\nwhere you can do this touch and see by feel.\nAnd as you feel along,\nyou'll eventually start feeling,\nedges and shapes on the wall like pictures.\nAnd then it slowly changes\nin these dark filling wood boxes of glass cases.\nAnd then as you get to see,\nwell, there's finally like,\nat the end of this massive tunnel,\nyou look in the case,\nand it's a humanoid puzzle puzzle.\nThat's how he is right now.\nHe's like, oh,\nand he can't play it off like,\noh, they're not actually human,\nlike, because they'll jack down and close,\nand the jewels,\nlike Egyptian and the Pharaohs,\nwhen they were baby.\nThey were buried in pretty much the same way\nas the Egyptians.\nAnd that's pretty much what he's found\nunderneath the ground,\nand he doesn't know how long he's been going.\nA wall and ceiling.\nThat's kind of what I'm about to imagine.\nHe's still banging on the road in the tail.\nHow much time has he had?\nHe's guarding the fashion to suit their dimensions.\nAnd I could not but think that their pictured history\nwas allegorical,\nperhaps showing the progress of the race that pushed him.\nThese creatures, I said to myself,\nwere to the man of the name of the city\nwhat the she-wolf was to roam,\nor some totem beast is to a tribe of Indians.\nHolding this view, I thought I could trace roughly\na wonderful ethic of the name of the city,\nthat the tale of a mighty sea coast metropolis\nthat ruled the world before Africa rose out in the waves.\nAnd of its struggles,\nit's like, oh, this is an artificial thing\nthat I would want to roam and believe in.\nI saw its wars and triumphs,\nits troubles and defeats,\nand afterward its terrible fight against the desert\nwhen thousands of its people here represented in allegory\nby the grotesque reptiles,\nwere driven to chisel their way down through the rocks\nin some marvelous manner,\ninto another world where of their files\nor in our natural portrait.\nIt was all vividly weird and realistic,\nand its connection with the awesome descent I had made\nwas unmistakable.\nI even recognized the passages.\nAs I crept along the corridor,\nthe right of the door.\nI saw later stages of the painting.\nA ventilation,\na leaf taking of the race that had dwells\nin the city and the valley around for 10 million years.\nThe race was so strange,\nwith the seas, their bodies had known so long,\nbut they had settled as known as the world's youth,\nqueuing in the virgin rock,\nto those kinds of shrines that which they never sought\nto worship one being the Lord is the Lord.\nNo, but the light is better.\nI studied the pictures more closely,\nand all the earlier side reptiles must represent the unknown men,\npondered upon the customs of the nameless city.\nMany things were peculiar,\nand inexplicable.\nWell, so here's my thing.\nWhat is the story?\nWhat is the story?\nWhich included a written-out decriminately written-out\nto a viral order that knows it everably later,\nas an independent definition in Bologna.\nIf there were curious, what was the story?\nI could, for example,\nat first you had no pictures to represent death,\nso funeral customs,\nsaved such as were related to wars,\nviolence, and state of justice.\nAnd I wondered if the reticent is shown\nfor a certain period of time.\nIt was as though an ideal of earthly immortality\nhad been fostered as a cheering elude.\nStill nearer the end of the passage,\nwhere painted scenes of the utmost picturesqueness\nand extravagance,\nwhere the third bottle of trust in the universe,\nthe name of the city and its desertion and growing ruin,\nand of the strange new realm,\nmore paradise,\nto which the race acued its way through the stone.\nThat's my corner.\nIn these views, the city and the desert valley\nwere shown always by moonlight,\nbut golden in the suffering of the fallen walls,\nand half remaining the spell in perfection of former times,\nshown respectfully and indecently by the artist.\nThe paradisal scenes were almost as dramatic as to be believed,\nportraying hidden world of eternal day,\nfilled with glorious cities\nand deferial hills and valleys.\nThe very last, I thought,\nI saw a sign of an artistic anticlimax.\nThe paintings were less skillful,\nand much more bizarre than even the wildest,\nand the earliest scenes.\nI mean, I think they seem to record slow decadence\nof the ancient history of that.\nA couple of the growing ferocity toward the outside world\nperished was driven by the desert.\nThe forms of the people always represented by the sacred reptiles\nappeared to be gradually wasting away,\nthough their spirit had shown hovering about the ruins\nby moonlight, gained in proportion.\nSo the place where it started,\nwas displayed as reptiles and ornament roads,\ncursed the upper air and all who preached.\nThere's one terrible final scene,\nshowed a primordial looking man,\na pack of hideeer of ancient durend,\nthe city of Peneternis, he's torn to a place\nI don't know, and he was happy to be running away and saying what.\nI remembered how the air,\nthe city of Peneternis,\nand was glad that beyond this place,\nthe grey walls were ceiling up there.\nAs I viewed the pageant of mural history,\nI had approached very closely the end of the low-sealed hall,\nand was aware of the great gate\nthrough which came all of the illuminating phosphorescence.\nCreeping up to it, I cried aloud\nand transcendent amazement of what lay beyond.\nFor instead of other and brighter chambers,\nit was only an illimitable void of uniform ladies,\nsuch as one my fancy when gazing down\nfrom the peak of Mount Everest upon a sea of suner mist,\nbehind me was a passage so cramped\nthat I could not stand upright before me\nwas an infinity of subterranean effulgence.\nReaching down from the passage into the abyss\nwas the head of a steep flight of steps,\nsmall numerous steps like those of the black passengers\nI had traversed, but after a few feet,\nthe glowing vapor's casted look was easy.\nSwung gravels, but against the left hand wall of the passage,\nwas a massive door of brass,\nand decorated with fantastic barriers,\nwhich could have closed,\nshut the whole inner world of light away\nfrom the vaults and passages rocked.\nI looked at the steps,\nand for the non-steered night tribe,\nI touched the open brass door and could not move it.\nThen I sank prone to the stone floor,\nmy mind aflame,\nwith prodigious reflections,\nwhich are not even a death-like exhaustion,\nbut vanish.\nAs I lay still with closed eyes,\nfree to ponder,\nmany things I had likely noted in the frescoes\ncame back to me with new and terrible significance.\nScenes representing the nameless city in its haven,\nand the distant lands,\nwith which its merchants traded.\nThe allegory of the crawling creatures\npuzzled me by its universal prominence,\nand I wondered that it should be so closely followed\nat a pictured history of such importance.\nThe frescoes, the nameless city,\nhad been shown in proportions fitted to the reptiles.\nI wondered what its real proportions\nthat magnificence had been,\nand reflected a moment on certain oddities\nI had noticed in the rules.\nI thought curiously of the loneliness\nof the primal temples and of the underground corridor,\nwhich, without dishewn thus,\nout of deference to the reptile deities\nthey are honored,\nthough it perforce reduced the worshippers to crawling.\nPerhaps the very rights had involved\nthe crawling in the notation of the creatures.\nNo religious theory, however,\ncould easily explain why the level passage\nin that awesome descent\nshould be as low as the temples,\nor lower, since one did not have a meal.\nAs I thought of the crawling creatures\nwhose hideous, mummified form\nthey were so close to.\nI felt a new throb of fear,\nmental associations of curious,\nand I shrank from the idea that,\nexcept for the poor primitive man torn to pieces\nin the last painting,\nmine was the only human form\namidst the many relics and symbols\nof primordial life.\nBut as always,\nin my strange and groving existence,\none day soon drove out fear,\nso on after the luminous abyss\nand what it might contain,\nbut it presented a problem worthy\nof the greatest explorer.\nThere being the weird world of mystery\nlay far down that flight\nand I'm too nearly small,\nand I hope to find there\nwhich is going to worry\nor which the painting court\nhad failed to get on the doorway.\nThe frescoes have pictured\nunbelievable cities\nwhose new vows\nand snow were one of them.\nSo this is my fancy,\nand it feels like the stairwell\nthat's lost,\nand it's weak buried down.\nLess like this,\nbut now here's a deep,\nI can certainly pass\nin my opinion.\nIt's almost like one,\nnot even the physical horror\nof my position in that,\nit's cramped,\nor your days of trials,\nand to have the frescoes\nor miles in the shadow\nof the world I knew wouldn't face\nby the door of a living,\nor life like this.\nCould match the people's red\neye-feld,\nand ancient,\nso vast,\nancient,\nnotable,\nseem to lear down\nfrom the pride of the stone,\nand rocky antennaes\nin the name of the city.\nOn the very outside\nof this town,\nthe maps of the frescoes\nand the spiritual shadow\ncaught on the list\nthat had this fountain\nwith only here and there,\nsome vaguely familiar\noutside.\nSo what could have happened\nin the geological\neons of the painting's face,\nand the death-hating race\nresentfully succumbed to decay,\nno man might say.\nLife had once teemed\nin these caverns,\nand in the luminous realm\nbeyond.\nNow, I was alone\nwith vivid relics,\nand I trembled to think\nof the countless ages\nthrough which these relics\nhad kept a silent,\nand deserted,\nvisual stations.\nSuddenly,\nthere came another burst\nof that ancient fear,\nwhich had intermittent\npieces,\nand the ever since I first saw\nthe terrible valley,\nand the nameless city\nunder God's will.\nDespite my exhaustion,\nI found myself\nstarting frantically\nto a sitting pass\nwith an amazing back\nalong the black corridor\ntoward the tunnels\nthat rose to the outer world.\nMy sensations were much\nlike those which had\nmade me shun the nameless city\nat night,\nand were as inexplicable\nas they were.\nIn another moment,\nhowever, I received\nstill greater shoggy\nin the form of a definite sound.\nThe first which had broken\nthe other silence\nof these two light depths.\nIt was a deep,\nlow moaning,\nas a distant throng\nof condemned spirits\nhad changed from the direction\nin which I was staring.\nIt followed you rapidly\nthrough till soon,\nthe reverberating\non my shoulder,\na little passage,\nplaying at the same time,\nI became conscious\nof an increasing draft\nof cold air,\nlikewise flowing\nfrom the tunnels\nand the city above.\nThe touch of this air\nseemed to restore my balance.\nFor I used to recall\nthe sudden gust\nwhich had risen\naround the mountain\nof this each sunset\nand sunrise,\none of which had indeed\nserved to reveal\nthe hidden tunnels to me.\nI looked at my watch,\nand saw that sunrise\nwas near,\nso braced myself\nto resist the gale,\nwhich was sweeping down\nwith cav and home,\nas it had swept forth.\nBut there is movement.\nMy fear again waned\nit.\nSince a natural\ncould it be known\nto exist so that\nthe distance of\nthe patule could take the\nminutes.\nMore and more badly\npoured the shrieking\nmoaning night wind\ninto that bell\nfor the inner\naesthetic.\nI dropped pro again\nand touched vaguely\nin the floor for fear of\nbeing swept bodily\nthrough the open\ngates of the\nphosphorus\nand actresses.\nSuch fury\nseemed unexpected\nand as I grew aware\nof an actual slipping\nof my form\ntoward the abyss,\nI was told\nby a thousand new\ntensions\nof apprehension.\nPurple\nfrom a sheet\npurple\nfrom a glass\nto winking\nof a feather\nand once more I could\nhide myself\nshudderingly\ninto that\ncorner.\nI tried to crawl\nagainst the murder\nas invisible torrent,\nbut I could not\neven\nthink of rage\nall the storm\nbecause it was\nlargely impotent.\nI think I screamed\nfantically\nin the last\nI was always\nout of control.\nBut if I diesel,\nmy cries were lost\nin the hell-born\ndabble\nof the howling wind\nrays.\nI tried to crawl\nagainst the murder\nas invisible torrent,\nbut I could not\neven hold my own\nas I was pushed\nslowly and in extra\nbit toward the\nunknown world.\nFinally,\nreason must have\nhold.\nFor I fell\nto babbling over\nand over that\nunexplainable\ncouple of the\nmad air about how\nshould it be?\nThere's a gateway.\nAnd suddenly the\ngateway is\nreaching the end.\nAnd with\na revolving death\nmay die.\nAnd it's\nborn to\nreimbruiting desert\ngods.\nAnd there was nothing\nin the dark\non the door.\nAnd now it's\nso\ncompletely\nnow it's\npulling around.\nAnd all is\nremembered\nin the nightweight\ntill oblivion\nor worse\nclaims me.\nMonstrous,\nunnatural,\ncolossal was the\nthing.\nToo far\nbeyond all the\nideas of man to be\nbelieved, except\nin the silent\ndamnable small\nhours when one cannot\nsleep.\nI have said that\nthe fury of the\nRussian blast was\nin my friend.\nPack into\nmaniacal.\nAnd that it's\nvoiceless,\ngenius, no doubt.\nAnd this is the\ndesolity\ntraumatized.\nSo I have a\npresently those voices\nwhile still\nchaotic before me.\nSeen to my\nbeating brain to\ntake\narticulate form\nbehind me.\nAnd so I\nwere there in the\ngrave.\nI am\n\n\n====== REC016.txt ======\nOkay.\nLovecraft has an interesting means of conveying character through interaction.\nWell, not just code, but it's in the world itself.\nHe has a very unique style of showing, but not telling.\nOh, you are.\nHe shows you through like descriptive dialogue.\nInstead of saying it's an old tomb.\nHe's using feelings.\nYeah, he expresses, well, he uses events to tie the theme.\nBecause that story took place in Egypt, or a desert planet.\nAnd so he mentioned Mesopotamia.\nHe mentioned Babylon.\nBut he never said, well, you will.\nHe said Mesopotamia was still young and with bricks of Babylon was baked yet.\nThat gives you an age of a few thousand BC, but it doesn't tell you when.\nHe didn't tell you, oh, it was this date.\nHe makes you a little bit to the details, and you connect the dots.\nSo it feels like a puzzle you're unwinding.\nIt's really good analogy.\nLike this, like how he describes on the city to us.\nBut it's the care of the talking, so.\nOkay, so, oh, you want to go back?\nLet me just try it.\nSo, keep going.\nYou want to pause for a bit?\nYeah.\nBecause it is interesting.\nI really like it.\nI need more examples.\nMore context of how this dialogue is going.\n\n\n====== REC017.txt ======\nGood?\nYeah?\nNice and smooth.\nThat was a good hit, too, because you just have to knock off some of the ATHC.\nThat's the thing I got to remember is this one doesn't mean anything.\nWow, that play was amazing, now.\nSo, what I think you should do when you are showing the play over the wall is don't tell them what they look like.\nWell, tell them what the wall is.\nSo many games make not even games or even movies today.\nThey tell you things like, oh, it's, it's called, oh, it's a bad town.\nThey don't elude to how it's about town.\nThe character just mentions, oh, this is a bad neighborhood.\nLovecraft, the way he shows that places are dangerous.\nTake for example, he did a story about, he was a grave keeper.\nHe would bury the people.\nAnd the story took place from his perspective of having to care for the tomb the night.\nAnd felt the story he had referencing one of the coffins was off.\nLike, it didn't look like he should fit.\nThe person who was maize for, because the person that they put in the coffin seemed bigger than what we've been there.\nAnd by the end of the story, it turns out that the guy was building substandard coffins.\nAnd he cut off that dude's feet.\nBecause the end of the story is he stuck calling out and the guy's army chews up his feet.\nYou don't have a lot of stories that have overall branching narratives.\nSo it's like, you have top ones.\nSo we're trying to establish the main characters right now.\nWe're trying to establish the initial action.\nThat's great. It's perfect. We should do that.\nBut I think we should also establish the overall thematic direction using plot points.\nSo what I want to establish here, let's say plot.1.\nYou are a dodeck, you can't observe.\nAs soon as you can see others, they'll talk to you, they'll interact with you.\nYou can't interact yet.\nAs soon as you go into the bathroom, you see the mirror, you see your hands,\nand then you can back out.\nYou interact with characters again.\nAnd then you're going downstairs.\nYou're exploring the space downstairs. I want to design that space still.\nIt could be the repair shop.\nOr it could be just another social space. It could be another.\nIt could be a fireplace.\nI don't know.\nYou're not extending the scene too long because they wasn't getting bored.\nYou're just watching cutscenes.\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\nImagine you're in a kitchen, it's a dining room, it's the rest of the house.\nI know, but you don't want to wrinkle at you all, I know.\nI mean, this is important because I need to re-\nI need to decrease the scope.\nThe scope can't be too large. I'm going to be careful about how far I expand.\nSo it's more of a careful consideration for how the player interacts with content,\nhow the player explores.\nAnd using the exploration as it means to encourage more playtime.\nEncourage slow and courage.\nIt's curious.\nNo, they can slip.\nThey can slip.\nRemember, they can slip through the task space, and then they give them legs.\nI know, but then they can walk around.\nThey want to explore the legs.\nSo they walk outside, they walk in the dining place, and then the door opens.\nOkay, but what I'm going to explain is if they don't have anything to do,\nthey're not going to be interested.\nOkay, let's say that downstairs.\nThere's going to be another walking simulator.\nOkay, I got an idea.\nOkay, what if, in that in relation to that, remember how we'll met?\nWho's in there right now?\nUh, Sorrell's in there.\nAnd Sorrell, as the player leaves,\nleaves with Kolesa.\nAll right.\nShe pinged that in to the player.\nBecause these two are close.\nKolesa and Sorrell are close.\nSo how do you establish that?\nSorrell, I've said that his point would be over and about.\nOr his point would be over soon.\nWe're almost ready.\nCan you, you want to come and talk?\nYeah, towards.\nThey're there.\nAnd we each other there.\nSo who's texting who?\nSorrell is texting Kolesa.\nOkay.\nOr not, or Kolesa is texting Sorrell.\nAnd that's...\nShe's in there, be style of things.\nShe wants to help him work.\nDoes she encourage him to do this?\nUm...\nShe leaves my loan until it's over.\nRight, but their friends, they want to hang out.\nOh no, here's how it is.\nIt's stepping back.\nUh, therapy is not a social stigma.\nIt's not stigmatized.\nIt's a stigma.\nIt's a stigma.\nIt's moral privacy.\nThere's no need for total privacy in this situation.\nIt's not about total privacy.\nTherapy is normal.\nTherapy is normal.\nTherapy is about a conversation between two people.\nIf that is the reason why would you inject\nin the middle of that process?\nWhat if they're also...\nThey also consider themselves to be helping.\nWell, why not just wait for them to come out?\nFor their friends that are understanding.\nWhy not just wait for them to come out?\nWell, that's what you don't need to have.\nThey'll be at text.\nYou can just come out of the room.\nBut they need to know that they're planning to hang out\nafter my therapy is over.\nWell, you just haven't mentioned it when it comes up to them.\nSo that way the player was involved.\nBecause if you do a text and you have to somehow\nillustrate the text to the player,\nif you just haven't come out and talk.\nYeah, that's talking to them.\nYou can still convey it to the player when you don't have to.\nWhat would they say?\nWhat would they say?\nDo you think?\nHow would you convey that information?\nYou don't have to necessarily say everything.\nYou can imply it.\nAnd I think the implication that these characters act on\nis more interesting than outright saying it.\nSo imagine, this is their path they have internally.\nBut the player doesn't know this.\nThey have to infer that it's too close to the friends.\nAnd they've interacted together in a way that's reasonable.\nLike, hey, they don't say this,\nbut you can infer that they're going to hang out\nafter their therapy is over.\nLike, just say it always too long.\nAnd then you understand that conversation break off.\nYeah, I'll be selling.\nLet's, you won't come with me.\nAnd they're like, yeah, and then they hang out.\nWell, they come to the credit system.\nThey're like, hey, oh, hey, there you are.\nOr no.\nI could be like, oh, hey, do you think you're thinking about it?\nOK, well, why isn't pooling that the player\nknows that they hang out?\nWhat if Cliff asks if she can hang out\nwith your therapist right now?\nYour therapist over?\nLike what if Cliff asks, OK?\nHey, are you feeling it?\nWhen I hang out?\nHey, how are you feeling when you want to hang out?\nI was just, that's just doing the whole thing.\nYou're not wanting to say it.\nWell, there you go.\nYou don't say anything at all.\nYou just let that interact.\nDon't say anything.\nLater, space doesn't make a difference.\nNo, but you don't think that that is...\nNo, you have to let curiosity, the characters,\nand the background of the characters.\nAnd you can do that.\nYou want to convey that they want to hang out.\nYou don't have to say, hey, let's hang out.\nExactly. You don't say anything.\nYou can talk about the entity that is just\nwalking up in your area.\nYou can just talk about them saying let's hang out.\nThey had planned hang out.\nIt's a coincidence that the thing actually woke up at this time.\nNo, but what he just recorded was you saying, hey, let's hang out.\nIf we're trying to avoid directly saying that.\nOkay, what if she comes in?\nOh, hey, it's awake.\nOkay, so now we've changed the scope.\nWe're talking about him and Ho.\nInteracting in front of the AI, different trade.\nOkay, but they'll set the back, set the back, set the back, set the back.\nLet's say, okay.\nBecause we're hoping again.\nSo we're trying to establish...\nYou can do more of the thing I said.\nJust spring it back.\n\n\n====== REC018.txt ======\nSo what I'm doing here, what I'm doing wrong is that I'm\nConnecting these two characters for the intent that they are to hang out, but I am\nAlso also needed to connect that the event of this character\nAs a wolf in these guys are attracted these guys are attracting and these two branch off they get on stairs\nSurprise because I was going to be by the AI so he's going to be curious about what's going on\nSo you don't need to talk to him you can just have him come into the situation naturally\nHas him come in and then you have them have the conversations that are talking about the AI\nBecause you said you want to do branches. Yeah, branches. So demonstrate those branches to the play over what they do\nSo imagine we talk about the AI to\nMarina or Maria whatever that mission is\nAnd have Melissa jump in and ask if they're still hanging out imagine those that the commosations branch\nInteresting idea here. Okay, they're don't like right the symbols though. They don't\nSo all right\nImagine\nThat the symbols\nWhen someone talks they it pops up above their head right the symbol appears in the first time you see curiosity\nwhen\nThe player wakes these characters\nCarden and Melissa curiosity curiosity\nOne than the other and then film it later on you're talking whatever curiosity it sees you\nYou think huh and then he also sees something else\nYou see the symbol for distrust why does he just trust the Dodeck?\nIt's\nHe said this is\nOr not distrust maybe it's what's the other one there's okay. There's enmity empathy a\nVersion attraction anger aggression\nI think you're trying to just put too much\nThis is how it's right here gets there\nBut you don't have to show it all on the whole scene you can show it on the street no no the player uses this is language\nSo imagine you can show this on the street. You don't need to have one more have a second symbol\nIf you're going to the street\nYou can show that second symbol in passing no wrong. It's it's it's only seen through the player's perspective\nThat's what I mean you don't need to throw all this at the magic\nImagine like you you see those symbols right you see those two symbols. That's it\nYou don't see those two you see the curious symbol you see others somebody don't it. Why does he don't know emotion?\nYou don't know to that with some others. Why is there another emotion because it needs to convey more information\nHe's out really curious but he's internally what what's his internal hot process?\nWhy because\nemotions are more complex than just\nAggression and\nI get what you're trying to do but why would he have it to a Dodeck if it's someone everyone accepts\nIt's a process that happens in your brain internally. You can't control it\nNo, but why what do you have it you already said that they accept it? It's it's there\nIt's like implicit. It's an incident. Plus it. Maybe it's not\nSo no, so maybe it's crazy, dude\nLet me show you I\nGot to show you killing your own narrative\nSo do you know it is at the\nIt's like being angry and hungry you have you're hungry, right? It's combination. It's another word\nThere's 150 words plus word. Why does he have a second one?\nBecause it's a behavior is an interacting together to make a outcome wasn't interested in the object their force\nHang on, dude. Okay\nSo\nYes\nAre you jumping in context? No, you're jumping up and down\nOkay, no, I guess you don't agree the 12 sides and then you take three days combined to make a make a make a feeling\nTo make a make an expression to make a to make him I know what you're trying to say. Yes\nOkay, so three. He's pop up at once. These are you have curiosity immediately and you have another one\nWhere's the other one?\nEveryone doesn't have to be distressed. It can be the one that said distressed though. It's attraction\nI did but I I was trying to explain it didn't have to be building me a note of when you're getting mad\nI'm following the narrative. I'm not mad. I'm just trying to explain this better\nNo, you're like giving me one and then you're changing and then you're getting frustrated\nYou're trying you're criticizing your criticizing you're criticizing correctly, but I'm trying to criticize\nI'm just trying to figure out why is there a second emotion being attached\nBut then you're criticizing that second notion and that's exactly what you should be doing\nRight, and if I'm not a Christian, it's just the question of what you're questioning it\nAnd then I'm saying that that's not quite right. That's not quite I'm trying to express it. That's not quite right\nThat's not quite I'm trying what that needs to be so because you're making points\nSo I'm trying to better articulate that this second expression\nIt's internally motivated\nOkay person. I can't control it\nThere are so such things through well. It's an expression out there\nOkay, so you throw in the free will thing and then again, I know we'll go out of free will\nWell, it's let's say it's it's the affect of your emotion\nOkay, so why do the other ones have this happen too?\nIt happens every one\nEvery one of these is having the woman as a symbol\nThe second one pops up and let's say this person is a symbol\nBut it's just immediate curiosity is the biggest you can have one two three\nOkay, depends on intensity and intensity for them. It's it's it's it's immediate curiosity\nSo you're saying that the others are feeling the same emotion as well, but you're not feeling the same emotion\nThey feel more senseless, so I imagine\nI'm not saying why have they only portrayed one symbol, but he's portraying two\nWhat is the difference there?\nBecause he experiences a little more complex emotions\nIt's not that's not a bad thing. No, but what is he imagine? Okay, imagine\nHave you seen such a secret? You know a symbol pop up? Yeah, so why are you making this like a calm a contest?\nIt's not a contest. This isn't journaling the player. This is communication. This is language\nThis is they can't be saying because he's focused second genitalities for the more complex the player can use words to communicate\nHe's your symbols. No, I know that. Well, I'm talking about one month symbol\nUh, but\nYou didn't see the symbols. I'm sure you saw it all talking about will make so you say woman's fill fill\nHas having a more complex set of films because he's having a second symbol\nYeah, the second symbol wouldn't that be the same for them?\nNo, since they're more interested in the dough that wouldn't show curiosity and something else like maybe\nOh, oh\nOkay, that's a good point. Okay, let's say okay. Let's let's let's do\none character shows extreme curiosity that would be cardin\nBecause he's interacting with\nMarian and then\nCalissa has\nElation in curiosity. She's happy surprised, but she's\nNot as intensely curious as cardin\nThat's not a bad thing. It's just how her knowledge of the situation. We don't have to just say anything\nBut that's why I'm justifying it's like half half. There are two emotions there. So she's curious\nWell, she's also happy really happy about it\nAnd then because she's aware that these things are cool. She likes a lot or whatever\nUm, and then you have cardin\nYou know, he's he's curious and Tancy curious about it. So he wants more. I can't wait to eat and then\nAs soon as Calissa pops out you see a second notion\nDesire\nAnd\nThe secondary so you have the the interaction her being there\nreplaces the intense\nUh\nWhat do you call it? The\nThe intense curiosity kind of halves it because now he's still interested to curious, but he's also\nAttracted this person\nUh, that's not necessarily an exceptional traction. It's also a traction as in social traction\nI don't know what she means, but who's attracted to who\nUh, cardin is attracted to\nMarian, but isn't she supposed to do getting therapy? No, Marian comes in. She's the engineer\nMy bad, I'm at the service. And then Calissa is the the person next to the friend of cardin. It's\nInterested. Okay. No, I got through the issues mixed up in my head and happy and then there's will met who is\nUh, so woman is curious. He's by himself from the room. I remember these simple\nCalissa's friend is next to her who will sit here and begin her that is in the therapy session. Yeah\nThe dude that is with Calissa also has a crush on the engineer\nAnd we have an established the therapist yet. Okay, so those two\nerasine and\nWhat's that?\nSurrell\nSo the way I would convey that this is a therapist type of setting\nis\nAfter he leaves\nMaybe don't necessarily say on his therapy\nMaybe it's asked how did the session go\nBecause session has a wide setting so you could have it be a variety of things\nYou're right, and that's a more of a what's more casual how to go, you know? Yeah\nWell, you want to kind of hand that there's something going on in the office because then it explains why there's so many very people sitting in this room\nIt's okay\nSo\nYou have to put a plot on the events\nWhat else could we do here? We need a second for us. We need us to try to\ncertainly hop around\nLet's get this reticulated\nSo\n\n\n====== REC019.txt ======\nI don't know, when you read to a tricky like this, it's like, let's look on this track\ncloser again.\nSo I don't want you to miss that in the next track, yeah.\nSo I need to draw, so we have, we need to draw right now, we need to figure out, we need\nthe floors as, as, as context for certain events.\nWhat's up?\nWe need the floors as context.\nWe want to know, so before we get to the second floor, we need, well, I know, we\nare going to draw this and then we're going to draw it to the point that they're\ninteracting with that.\nNo, no, but folks, we need to plot out the interaction in the top store right now.\nOkay.\nBecause right now we have all this actions we want to do, so we need to write a scene in\nthe sheet.\nIt's bullet, bullet pointed like you're in a screenplay.\nOkay, how do you, oh, there's actually a storyboard in that, right?\nWell, we can't just, we need to grab some sticky notes, we'll set them on to here.\nBranch and storyboard.\nBranch and storyboard.\nWell, because, no, we got to figure out, scene one is, you wake up and you look around.\nScene two, you will have noticed.\nThe transition between scene one and scene two is, you hear the conversation between\nthe two sitting next to you.\nScene two is that noticing you and then you gain the ability to move around the room.\nOnce you get the ability to move around the room, we need to figure out scene three,\nwhich is either talking to them, or you're not listening to interactions, you're actually\njust giving the train events.\nYeah.\nThat's what we're trying to do right now.\nGive the train events online.\nBecause once we get to the chain of events for a good out, we'll figure out the conversation\npoints.\nAnd once we figure out the conversation points, we'll flush out the conversations by doing\na screenplay writing on the, because what I'm trying to do is get the, the flesh figured\nout now of what the screen button needs to be, but to do that, I need to know the sequence\nthat an event's take place in.\nWe'll just add on as we go, because we'll start with that phenomenon.\nRight.\nOkay.\nSo first of all, we have the seed awakening.\nYeah.\nI'm just fucking, don't use that on the wall.\nHuh?\nDon't use that.\nTake that off the wall and write on this.\nI don't want it bleeding through to the wall.\nOkay.\nAwakening is A or E?\nAwakening.\nAwakening.\nA-W-A-K-E-N-I-M-G.\nYeah.\nThat's good.\nAnyway.\nThat's in copy details.\nSee the Awakening.\nSo, uh, let's do the player point of view.\nLet's do the player point of view.\nTry and advance.\nWell, we don't need to do the point of view on that.\nWe just need to do that.\nNo, it isn't kind of important.\nI mean, it's like it's conveyed to us.\nWe're more worried about what they can do now.\nSo now, let's go away and then we can look around.\nBecause you said they're going to unlock as they go.\nYeah.\nBecause you said next they get their hands on the go to the bathroom.\nSo now, we've got to draw the sequence of events that leads into the bathroom,\nwhich is the conversation between the two next to them,\nand then either talking to one or the going moment.\nSo we don't need to convey everything on that right now.\nWe're just trying to pull up.\nNo, we're trying to pull up.\nWe're trying to pull up.\nSo you're right.\nThis is stupid.\nI shouldn't be doing that.\nI shouldn't be doing that.\nIt looks like you're actually building the game.\nFirst person view of view.\nYou want to note that they can now move tethered movement.\nSo the next one is a locked event, you want to note that.\nLocked event?\nWhere is Jesus ticking out on the wall?\nUnlocked event?\nWait, let's just use the second one.\nWe have already fully stocked out of new ones.\nAre you right here?\nDo you want to run away from right in front of you?\nNo, I mean, why not?\nI just have to use these ones before we start having new ones.\nSo this is the second new details before this?\nAnd let me try to read my first time.\nSo the next step is he wakes up.\nOkay.\nOh, okay, you're going to give him an axe.\nWell, so he's obviously going to have to wake up and then you can move.\nAnd then no matter what, he said the interaction with these two is locked.\nBecause they're going to notice you.\nSo now that he's noted, we have to figure out what happens next.\nAll right.\nAll right.\nSo in this space?\nWell, so we might as well write down the conversation between those two.\nBecause no matter what, the players are going to be part of it because they're next to them.\nYou're right.\nSo that's what we're going to play.\nThat's all right.\nWe have to figure out what we're doing from there.\nOkay.\n\n\n====== REC020.txt ======\nI hope to have it, I hope to have it, I hope to have it, I hope to have it, I hope to have it, I hope to have it, I hope to have it, I hope to have it, I

I was going to do subtle choices like listening to conversation or not.\nThat is a good subtle choice actually.\nBecause if the player waits they can loan but if they just jump in they just get back in and it's not something major but it kind of just shows how they can manipulate conversation from the beginning.\nJust like how all the woods did what you can have that maybe take over but they didn't make that option literally unknown.\nThat's the 5th of the time.\nYou might be wondering what I'm referring to is the save course.\nI mean this is this sort of commission for it so that I need to convey this.\nWell how can you do a physical mockup and then just make...\nWell no words don't do it. Words don't express enough.\nI mean have them draw the symbol for you.\nOh I got it. Like that.\nAnd then have them make you a template so that you can just draw inside of it.\nThat's true.\nKind of like there's only one ETC for different quotas.\nI need frontouts.\nYeah.\nAnd then you just turn off the letter here.\n\n\n====== REC021.txt ======\nso get printouts of these symbols\nlike lots\nor a page of for it\n\n\n====== REC022.txt ======\nyourself get stencil, or make stencil using cardboard for the symbols for the, uh, effects.\nHuh?\nUh, the so called caro, it's, uh, you heard it because you can shoot on it, let's see, make\nyou have stencils and images.\nOkay, I'll talk to you.\nI'll talk to you.\nI'll talk to you.\nI'll talk to you.\nI'll talk to you.\nI'll be right.\nYou play how to print out.\nI have a pretty monol.\nOh, it's a little token.\nIt's a metal token.\nI can make that magnet on them.\nOr better yet, I could have them attached to text or, um, also if you do just the empty stencil.\nI can make the magnet, I can make the, I can make the magnets get a magnet board.\nYeah, but the stencils are also, then we can draw them into something else and move it\nthat piece.\nWe just need that one physical copy.\nOkay, yeah, that works.\n\n\n====== REC023.txt ======\nI'm gonna, so real quick, just grab the scene, we have a desire for curiosity, and this is who?\nThis is, and then you have, and this scene, you have someone else, someone else's reaction,\nso what's the immediate reaction that is?\nYou can have some attendance.\nYou have Kalissa and Cardin.\nSo the interaction with the panel and the characters level will be invested in the event?\nKalissa sees first, and then Cardin reacts.\nSo, how invested is Kalissa and do this?\nShe's curious. She's excited.\nOkay, so...\nOr no, no, actually neither of them see the player has to interest themselves to them.\nOkay, so then what would the, so the interaction with each other would be a mix of curious and what?\nCurious and...\nRelation.\nIt's a relation with either...\nYeah.\nAnd then, most of what she's saying, she is a...\nSpots the Dodec.\nSpots the Sprout. Spots the player.\nOkay.\nRecognizers the player.\nHer, no.\nShe's, becomes, is, if...\nShe becomes aware.\nIf aware.\nIf aware, then...\nAnd when she, what does she feel?\nThen...\nOh, look.\nI'm surprised.\nNo, no, no. If, if, if, if then aware, what does she say?\nI should say.\nWhat's up?\nThis is, this is, this describes the entire thing.\nYeah.\nIf aware, then what's the interaction?\nWhat does she say?\nWhat does she mean?\nWell, you're just surprised to rather be a simple escalation to you.\nOh, look, you're weak.\nHey, you're weak.\nYeah.\nOh, hey, you're weak.\nYou could be as simple as, oh, just, hey, where you would look.\nOh, hey, there, I'm weak.\nOh, hey, there, I'm weak.\nYeah.\nAnd I'll use purple for that.\nBecause that's character.\nThat's...\nKalissa.\nYeah.\nThen Kalissa.\nKalissa should be...\nIn...\nOh, we are dark.\nOh.\nWe are dark.\nWe are dark.\nWe are dark.\nJust...\nIf aware.\nMight have sight.\nThen...\nCharacter and Tract.\nHey, there.\nOh, hey, you're weak.\nSo we have...\nOh, we didn't actually...\nThat's...\nYeah, what?\nSo she's leading the action to the action.\nOh, hey, you're weak.\nYeah, what?\nSo she's leading the action to the action.\nYeah, what?\nSo she's leading the action to the action.\nYeah, what?\nSo she's leading the action to the action.\nYeah, what?\nShe is.\nJust one more time.\nJust say that.\nMake it very obvious to myself.\nThis is...\nThe method I use.\nThis is...\nThis is...\nIf any...\nIf any...\nThis is...\nThis is...\nThis is...\nThis is...\nThis is...\nThis is...\nThis is...\nThis is...\nThis is...\nCome on, no, it's hard to be come on.\nLet's meet her.\nSo the whole force actually pull this way, the whole point of the effect.\nSo what is she doing, and the one that comes up to me, she's talking to the other guy?\nSo what is she doing when the dough didn't approach us, you said she's talking to the other guy?\nYeah, they're talking to them.\nSo what was one of the conversations of the person, can you hear the story of the conversation?\nHe can, does he wait up like the story of the conversation?\nHe wakes up in the middle, they wake up in the middle.\nWhat are they talking about then?\nThey're talking a little bit about art.\nSo I'd have artists read a philosopher, read me a scientist, and depending on, read an artist\nthat is interested about the world, and a scientist that is interested in human violence,\nis that who they were, or was that what you thought it was about?\nThere was those two people, those they're background knowledge.\nSo how are those interacting, how are the, that's one of the answers, so, philosopher, scientist.\nSo in our every conversation they have, what's going to be about the philosophy?\nNo, not necessarily, but like Dirt Tash, this is the background, this is, I know,\nbut you can talk about it in a casual way, or you can have socialization experience.\nYeah, but not every one of those socializations in the year-round, it's how it is.\nSo this is one thing I need to find, so there's art, science, philosophy, and then there's\nanother one that I'd like to posit, and that is socialization, or socialize,\nright, socialize, socialize, and not on sociology, that's the science I'm talking about,\nthe art of socialization, the, not the art, the, the human form of human expression,\nif art, philosophy, and science are forms of human expression, socialization is just important,\nand that is the form of art I'm trying to convey, using these symbols.\n\n\n====== REC024.txt ======\nIt's called an affect, and there are 12 affects on the dodeck.\nOkay, but an affect isn't pulsing out of each other.\nAn affect is a result of a person I train. It's an affect of...\nOkay, but that's not something that you'd be talking about right now.\nNo, no, no, no, no.\nTo figure out what someone is really talking about, you need to understand their context,\nunderstand their intent.\nUnderstand them well, you need to know their motivation, their behavior, their expression.\nThat's what the symbols are for.\nBecause we've used...\nOkay.\nIt that?\nSo what are they talking about?\nIf aware.\nNo one's not talking about it, so we can know what symbols to use.\nThese are four.\nThat's what the symbols that...\nNo, no, we're trying to figure out what they're talking about to know what symbols to use.\nNo, we're not talking about what they're talking about.\nYes, but what are they talking about?\nNo, this creates this.\nThis implies this, this curiosity.\nOh, I'm curious, and I'm...\nI'm not talking about the emotion, I'm talking about the topic that they're talking about.\nOkay, the topic they're talking about, so let's see...\nThey're talking about...\nDo you see curiosity?\nThey're talking about what they're talking about.\nOkay.\nI'm talking about...\nWhat is he hearing after?\nWhat is the conversation that is taking place?\nWhat could have been that conversation?\nWhat's the time of the ethics?\nI mean, can it be...\nWe're going for an after-term conversation.\nNo, we need conversation that's relevant to the theme relevant to the area.\nSo give me something.\nThrow me a bell here.\nThrow me an idea.\nOkay.\nSo you said there's another guy in the back.\nAnd you said that the well of the seed is going to wake up.\nSo all they're waiting for the seed to wake up.\nAll they're waiting for more friends.\nThey have different intense.\nBecause you also mentioned one has a crush on the...\nAnd you knew a shake.\nSo he is more...\nI'm trying to figure out the intent of being in the room.\nWell, they're doing therapy, but they don't think that this seed is going to erupt at any moment.\nThey're not sure.\nThey're anticipating it, but it's been months now.\nNo, I don't mean like...\nThey don't wait until they don't...\nThey don't switch between anticipation and expectation.\nSo expectation is you know it's going to happen.\nIt's going to happen immediately.\nOkay, it's mundane expectation.\nThey know it's going to happen, but they don't go away.\nYeah.\nSo they know they're going for therapy or for their friend.\nYeah, they're on therapy or...\nWell, because I'm trying to figure out the intent.\nSo all they patient, so it was just him.\nThey know it's all of them.\nThey're all patients, but then Marion is not a patient.\nOkay, so they're all there to talk to this lady then.\nYeah.\nOkay, so then that gives us a reason why they're there.\nThey're all there for the same reason.\nSo then you don't have to necessarily shake that.\nI wouldn't maybe talk about reasons to be there,\nalthough maybe talking about the previous visit.\nBecause if their friends are willing to share it,\nbut they're not going to share it every single detail.\nOkay, so...\nSo if you want their establish,\nif she's someone that they go to the council,\nyou could say, hey, they're really hoping I don't ask.\nI'm hoping I can get the same result.\nAnd they've had the other folks who go, me too,\nmaybe she'll help us again.\nWhen you go deeper in conversation than that, though,\nit needs to be a more...\nNobody needs to talk to me to walk on that.\nOkay, let's talk about the topic.\nLet's go deeper than topic.\nSo what are they talking about?\nThey're talking about interacting with each other.\nThey're talking about using therapy as a means of therapy.\nYeah, they're talking about the use of therapy on their bodies.\nSo the philosopher is talking about the non-truth,\nnot like philon philosophy,\nbut the casual philosopher is talking about...\nThis is healthy means which take care of yourself.\nIt's a good thing to do.\nThat's a social...\nI'm not a philosopher, a sociologist.\nSo a sociolite.\nIf it makes sense.\nYou are an artist.\nYou are a scientist.\nYou are a philosopher.\nYou are a sociolite.\nIf that's too bad.\nI don't know what you mean, but no.\nIt's just...\nGive me another word.\nI'm trying to figure out a natural conversation\nbecause the way we're trying to get rid of this conversation\nis the time to hold a deep conversation.\nYou're trying to get back on the characters.\nAnd I'm using these four...\nI don't have to throw everything out at once.\nYou can start off slowly\nbecause we're going to have more time to explain.\nSo you need to start off immediately\nthat's the scientist.\nYou can start off at a slow pace.\nYou can just have it be a Monday topic.\nBecause you want to give the player a reason to dig.\nSo if you start off immediately,\nwhat everyone's worrying on,\nthey'll see what they are.\nThe player has no reason to dig.\nOkay, so the player does not know what they're...\nbut we know what they are.\nWe know them.\nWe don't express this in the end.\nWe have us to background in our minds.\nThese are who they are.\nSo let's make characters.\nSo this is what we're doing.\nLet's make characters to traits.\nSo Ryan, she is an engineer.\nOkay, so what are you talking about?\nI know we're not.\nBut I need to...\nI'm listening to them all.\nLike...\nEngineer...\nCarden is...\nLet's just focus on what we need right now.\nLet's probably get lost.\nWell, I can...\nCarden is attracted to...\nRyan.\nThe moment is...\nA player should be there too.\nPlayer.\nNot enough.\nThat should be there.\nSo right now,\nwho should focus on...\nis the chick,\nand the person that she saw directly.\nBecause we need to figure them out\nso we can figure out the conversation.\nOkay, so there's Kalissa.\nCarden.\nIt's a Mario.\nI didn't know no traits there.\nAll right, so Carden, he is...\nKalissa, she is...\nthe scientist.\nCarden is the...\nlost father,\nbecause he's super excited.\nOr should we let him be around?\nIt's okay with this.\nHmm.\nI want Carden to be like...\nWe'll close this more later back.\nShe's more...\nintrospective.\nAnd Carden is more...\nCarden is more...\nHow does that work?\nHow does that work?\nHow does that work?\nHow does that work?\nHow does that work?\nBecause then that peaks the players interest,\nbut it also gives you a chance to talk about the walls.\nLike, we don't need to pick this specific project.\nWe use those projects.\nBecause then they get talking...\nit's an event that's still relevant,\nbut it's not tied to one build.\nSo then we can bounce around.\nShe can talk about more of how she's excited about some of the new...\nconstruction materials they've developed.\nAnd he can talk about maybe more of what he plans\nthat they hope to do for the space.\nBecause if you send ones socially based,\nand that means they'll probably be more interested in maybe...\nwhat's going to go in that space?\nWhat are they going to build?\nIs it going to build community areas?\nIs it going to be housing?\nAnd maybe the scientists want to be more interested in...\nthe tourism they're going to be using,\nor it's very easy to do what they're researching\nto help with building the new expansion.\nBecause then you get...\nhow coated you have about both,\nbut also you cover the wall.\nBecause you get, I realize,\nyou're not going to have a lot of room for dialogue.\nYou're typically going to want to keep your conversation short\nbecause you don't want to play it to get too...\ndisinterested.\nYeah.\nSo a little...\nmaybe if they'd oxygen-free?\nWhat's up?\nIf they'd oxygen-free or not in the woods?\nI've seen oxygen-free, yeah.\nOxen-free.\nWhat?\nOxen-free.\nWhat about neither woods?\nWhat is it?\nNight in the woods?\nNo.\nOne about...\nwhat's the one?\nFirewatch.\nYeah, we normally talk about firewatch the full time today.\nOkay.\nYeah, that's all three different stories.\nBut I'm thinking more in terms of dialogue from Oxen-free\nor...\nor, in other woods.\nIn other woods to describe it,\nthey have these...\nI'm sure that a burst of conversation.\nThey're not long-winded discussions.\nThey're more naturalistic back and forth.\nIt's a conversation of friends.\nWhat are some times to keep it that way?\nYeah, so it's like,\nwhat are they saying?\nOh, hey, they're awake.\nWhat's next?\nThis is natural.\nThey just go through it.\nWell, so we haven't figured out...\nso what are they talking about?\nBecause they're not going to know as the player instantly.\nWe were just at the point of figuring out the conversation.\nWe said that they were talking about the construction connection.\nSo this is...\nthis is technically how it's towards them.\nThis is after that.\nSo who's speaking?\nPolice or the other one?\nCan let's say speaking.\nI mean, she's talking about...\nis he the science one or the social one?\nOh, right now.\nCardin says this.\nYeah.\nOkay, is he the science one or the social one?\nSocial one.\nSo he would probably begin the conversation with...\nwhat do you think they're going to put\nwhile we're expanding?\nAnd then you would have to either...\nadd on to that or begin her own point,\nor she would be...\nI don't know, but...\nand then she would either tie into the scientific processes\nthat they're using to build materials\nor what she hopes to be put there,\nkeeping up the conversation.\nSo you have to decide if she follows the flow\nor goes against the flow.\nBecause if she goes if the flow,\nthen the poor fire will probably be...\nsomething along your lines...\nwhat she hopes this faces\nand when she's moving the whole topic.\nBut if she goes against the flow,\nthen she will just immediately state the whole topic.\nGood point.\nOkay, so is she...\nanxious about her or is she aggressive about it?\nI think she's...\nShe's excited.\nShe's just about it.\nNo, she's curious.\nShe's curious.\nAnd maybe pleasure.\nBecause you're excited, you're happy about it.\nYou're thrilled.\nPleasure and...\nno, pleasure, relation and desire.\nAll three.\nIt's very complex.\nNo, we get through right to this down.\nOh, I haven't...\nNo, here, but...\nYeah.\nOh, they can last again, actually.\nIt's easier if the visual is normal.\nSo, I'm going to...\nSo, pleasure.\nRelation.\nAnd desire.\nAnd then it would be...\nIs she...\nOn start.\nIs she following the topic or is she

this time around\nDo you think we'll a commission for do you think we'll what do you what do you call it?\nI'd be do you think we'll sponsor no, it's like a oh, yeah, but\nIt's not that zoning zoning is controlling the government. It's not like a collective agreement to both here\nIt's a it's a\nZoning is\nZoning is not a thing in this kind of society. There's no cards. So people built people people people people spend people\nPeople expend people have the resource to build larger, but they need to work together to expand\nWhich is why they have\nOkay, imagine this imagine this imagine city being built out worth and as things are built people would come together to build them\nThey build a platform and then they built\nHuh, you going to have a deal?\nYeah, they will they're\nPeople will get built wherever they want to if they want to build right next to their office. They can\nWhy don't you have rules for that? It's just\nImagine rules about efficiency. It's not about efficiency. It's about socialization\nIt's in that lab\nYou really want that lab being next to the house. It's not the okay. I think you mean there those more rigorous facilities need to be\nHigher up\nWe know but but the casual facilities the ones that are not of science that that is potentially catastrophic is\nIs\nOr more technical needs more space. You know, I feel like I was I'm not you're getting that in the details again\nWe're walking on more reply. She said she wants resource facilities\nCorrect. Yeah, so then what is this is a pie to that?\nHmm\nHe's sold it away\nThe expansion projects and he hopes he asked so what does she think?\nIt's been a bit of support for the research facilities because he has a positive group by the way\nI hope okay. Yes. Oh, nice for any more knowledge. No, I don't really think that this is a little better than that\nWhat are you guys what field are you guys in?\nWhat field where fields are came in and what field field field is your group? I'm a field is your your your\nSo he's interested in the topic your comrades. You're what do you call them?\nYou're your resource\nNo, no, you're you're your positive your group. You're your family. You're who what?\nWell team team your team. Yeah, that's always a photo as a team\nBut it's not like your\nCo-workers, no, not co-workers. No, so the collaborators. It is collaborators teams\ncollaborators or teams\nTeam collaborators. What do you call that?\nLittle they they discuss. No, you you want this team, but there's also they didn't really express\nThey're also funding together to do this\nThey already do that as a team as a resource team to leave each person brings their expertise in the research money. Oh\nOkay, yeah, that works\nThey just use team because they're not focused on titles that focus something and result together\nOkay, on start\nWhat do they say they say?\nWhat's the role of the title of the organization is he's talking about the expansion garlics\nSo response is she wants resource facilities his response is\nWhat is your team studying?\nAnd then now we have to figure out the shoe respond or does she change topics?\nMachine is not pushing its science\nIs no it's\nTechnology\nBecause the flexion is in the same bad thing. It could be maybe she's isn't what's on the whole thing\nHey, she's been doing it for\nAll day and she doesn't even break them in\nSo does she stick the topic that she deflect?\nHow is your team expanding?\nIt's not a one horse horse response. Oh, I'm his question was what is she\nResulting and then who response little on there she answers this is what\nShe answers openly\nWe're looking into I mean it's it's it's almost done. We we started a week ago\nI mean, I mean it's another another few days of their construction, but it's almost finished\nFor the time of the research for the building of the structure\nYou need to convey that's outward building\nNo, no, so\nShe's starting her own facility. I know, but okay, so you just\nYeah, you gotta change his reply then, okay, because you're his reply is what is your team researching and the whole\nResponses what two days done, okay, so we're building so we got a chance to respond\nOkay, let's change his response. What did you say?\nHonestly, why?\nOkay, I'll say on start what is that's what he says, okay, so is he is talking to all about\nThe expansion and he asks\nI mean he stays\nWhat are they going to build or what do you think they're going to build is what he asks so\nIf what did you want to try to do that?\nSo what is your question to be currently you asked two questions one question was okay, so what would you for the thing to ask?\nHow did you get to the question? How do you get that?\nOur team\nNo, so what is the opening statement he gave he gave that they're expanding the facilities\nUnderwork backwards here. Yeah, they're expanding the facilities. They're uh, and he talks about the instruction and he hopes that they build what social spaces\nNo, he doesn't he's he's social\nI'd be socializing. He's a show. He's a socializing. Yeah, but what does he hope is be built does he ask so\nHe's more curious. I think okay. I'm trying to I know I don't need his traits. I need you to give me what he's asking curious and\nUh, wanting\nNo, that's the same thing actually\nYeah, um, okay, so\nWe have established she stated that the facility is being expanded\nHe asked so what does she hope is being built what is her response\nher\nresponses\nOh, we're building a facility we're building a facility for um by engineering\nnot by engineering let's say uh\nOh, we're building a yeah, yeah, by engineering. We're building a by engineering. We're we're almost the facilities almost done\nThe biorenger or uh, we're not doing anything yet, but um our biorenger\nBy our engineering facility, we'll be up in a few days\nOkay, so then what do we go from there?\nUm\nPardon says maybe\nThere's no going to have to build this conversation like five times\nBecause now we know that this is joining the only one is this once. Oh, so there's no branching. There is branching\nBut it's it's it's very it's spaced out\nA little more than I think no much for this conversation\nNo, because you can't interact you can't do anything yet\nOkay, so these are conversations with me over there\nBut it's it's it's instigated by the player's interaction\nSo the direction it takes can be changed a little bit\nSo I mentioned like you're\nYou talk to close the first you talk to your first and then card jumps in you talk to cool. It's hard to card\nAnd then it jumps in there's subtle variation of this conversation is happening before they realize the AI's up\nSo you have to forget him for now. Okay, let's focus on what they're talking about. I need you to come up before response\nNo, here's the response she has an out-to-intent that\nThey're building an environment you're knowing lab and it's finished in two days. So what is it response of that?\nOh, yeah, no, it's um\nYeah, I'm excited. It's gonna be cool\nYeah, I'm excited. It's gonna be fun. Yeah, I'm excited. It's gonna. Yeah, we're really excited for him because season's not a sign to season so for that\nYeah, we're really excited you should come visit\nNo, we're on his response\nYeah, we got to fight his response. You got to make it a little more because you asked\nYeah\nSo why is she inviting him on his response? Oh, damn it. Okay. So he responds\nAgain, nobody say\nDamn it dude. It's so hard\nI think we're focusing to about to that that was great\nThat was the dialogue is\nNo, so right now we'll try to figure out what the AI is over here and before he approaches\nSome of them are having a conversation. This is that's really difficult because you have to as far as out of conversation. It's unnatural\nBecause it yet that we're we can't drop never think we have to actually you start somewhere\nWell, no, so what I'm trying to do is build a conversation because once we get a conversation going\nWe can find a cutoff point in the middle with this is how you start this hard part of your story\nIn the first flow of that information\nWell, yeah, so what I'm trying to do is we want him to come into the middle\nSo if we figure out what he's talking about we can then expand the actual dialogue\nThis isn't the actual dialogue. We're just building bullet points to expand from okay, because you said he's gonna come into the middle\nSo can you can you just so let's get this expanded and then we'll figure out a cutoff point in the middle\nSo that was hold up for the AI to figure it was happening. All right, let me try this for that. I'm gonna do\nLet's go back to getting let's grab to cardinette the question. Okay, so causes question was\nDid you hear about the expansion projects? What do you think they're going to build?\nYou\nYou don't want these pants up for us. We're gonna burn these sticky nuts. What's it? They're lots\nOkay, this is up for me\nUm, what did we said her response was because this isn't going to be the extra dialogue\nYou're gonna have to walk with your voice actors and figure out that. Yeah\nThis is one of the script dialects both of us so we did\nWe described situation they can turn it to better dialogue later on. Yeah, this is just so that they have something to walk off\nDid you hear about the expansion projects?\nYeah, they're they're interesting\nUh, no. Yeah, my team's working one of them. Well, so it wouldn't be working on it if she's a scientist\nShe would say\nYeah, my team is getting one of the facility's\nNo, we'd be given because they're not paying for so we'll be given one of the new facilities\nNo, no, yeah, we collaborated on the new facility\nYou know, it's like well because we know they'd work together on this. This is their team. Yeah, my team collaborated on one of the new facilities\nWell, have we have we're expressing excitement because\nShe's getting a brand-new testing facility which for a scientist is like a golden egg\nYeah, my team kind of what my my team's uh because you gotta realize if this is a new expansion\nThat means if you who research is priority so I mean she's excited because\nOkay, I got she's being chosen out of this 20 billion population to get lab\nOkay, so if she would be pretty excited that relation. Yeah, she'd be pretty elated\nAnd she'd probably be gushing about a walk because and desire because she wants to she she she wants no more. She's curious. She\ndesires curiosity\nPlease fees there, right?\nToday is\nTuesday. Yes, I have Wednesdays Thursday and I believe Friday off. Okay, and then what else pleasure?\nYou think oh\nYeah, definitely I\nWell, we gotta remember there's actually a few more here. I want to list\nUm, they're not in the dough that I can't\nBut I conveyed it's my artist. He's gonna do it since it before to pay him\num\nenmity\ndistrust empathy trust shame embarrassment prime confidence\nSo the interesting ones there would be pride and shame and then trust distruster and empathy enmity\nAs better describers. We can't forget about that. Would you see empathetic grand pathetic against\nUsually right now. She's starting. She's yeah, it's not\nYeah, I know you want to use the other ones really. Oh, it's a shame embarrassment. I don't think these ones are relevant yet\num\nPride confidence\nSo what do you have already\nFor to we have\nUh\nAnd it's not I don't have memorized yet\nWe have\nlittle not pleasure. We have elation\nindesire and then we have\neither one um\npride\nSo then what does she say\nFor case Peter pride um\nWe want to stick with yeah, what my team was given one of the facilities. Yeah, my team was given one of the facilities\nOkay, so then let's stick with that\nSo then his response was the question. Oh, what filter you guys in\nYou\nNo, it has to be more forcing than every it probably would be something close to like\nCongratulations, oh really and then it would be followed by what is your team\nresearching\nOkay, did you hear within the project spent did you hear about the new uh expansion projects? Yeah, my team's working one of them\nWhat a whole team was given a laugh\nAnd my team collaborated to build a lab\nYeah, my team collaborative. I don't know\nYeah, my team got one cold\nNo, I would just you pick\nI'm just trying to\nSo we're trying to bring it to what she's describing called fill great. Yeah\nSo\nIf\nIf she's talking about the expansion projects will team wouldn't be the focus of the conversation would be the project itself\nSo it would probably be along the lines of we were given a lab my team was given a lab or I was given a lab\nAnd then after he asked about the wolf as one should probably\nSo\nThat'll be the name forever heard the person talking\nRepresentative my text. Representative my colleague\nUm, and then\nShe says\nDid you hear about the new expansion did you hear about the expansion?\nHas your team expanded yet?\nHe does know about how close is your cuz he's your close member and how close your team to be finished\nOkay, so\nHis question is flawed then from the beginning. Yeah, it is so I need to go back\nSo he knows he's curious. He's more uh\nWell, so\nShe might not know that she has a lab yet. No, no, they're close friends. Yeah, but it doesn't mean they're talked about it like she wants to\nShe's in some regard. They're fine. She might collaborate on the lab, but she might not know. She was being given a lab yet\nNo, no, they worked together to build it\nI know, but she might not have not known. She's receiving the lab\nShe might have just thought she was walking on the lab\nWhy would you not have an expectation if it's built up machines and they have an expectation of one if you don't\nCollaborate so collaborativeism resources wise. No, I know, but that's what I mean. She's realizing she owns the lab as an after\nShe might think this is a project. She's being assigned to welcome. No, it's not an assignment. It's her her her and her team want to build this\nHer and her team are building this. There's no government involved. It's just them\nOkay, but then that thought makes that question pause. Then we have to fix that question. No, no, it's fine as is\nIt's just my team and I are almost done. It's through a few days away. No, so he's asking so the way that I question his phrase is\nHe doesn't know what they're building\nSometimes we have to rebuild it because the question is\nDo you know what they're doing with the expansion projects? But if she knows he's building if he knows she's building a lab\nHe wouldn't ask that he would ask how far along this will allow\nOkay, yeah, that's that's that then\nSo let's see that's\nSo would that be that'd be desire to know you're very curious\nAnd then you have\nWe'll get ones and many empathy and then\nSo what we're talking about the lab\nWe're talking about the symbol and then yeah, but they're expressing his\nRelations of the lab was what we're trying to discuss\nYeah, I know\nI just hold that thought hold that dialogue bit. I'm trying to articulate using this\nNo, I know, but we're trying to use that to figure out emotions\nSo if it's his friend, yeah, it's the first emotion you have written down\nIt's desire\nOkay, so it's curiosity. It's curiosity or desire. It's both\nErosion desire one of the same they are want there. It's also curiosity. It's it's okay. There's a whole torsum too\nI need to know what the symbol you're in now. The symbol is what it is right there. This one. Yes, this one the second one\nThis one is a footnote of desire. Okay, so we have a desire already\nSometimes we need to be able\npieces of that\nWhat is what he'd be feeling though in that whole lab is being built?\nUm\nIs he asking how far the lab is?\nWe can't make the empathy trust this trust\nAnd then there's another one there was so trust wouldn't be enrolled. Yeah, all right. They wouldn't be enrolled\nSo then you have to the one\nWhat is it?\nBrain come out here\nJust would help me out here\nShameless and bride confidence\nI don't know this fit. So let's just say it's extreme curiosity\nThat's why you need to say really. Okay\nYou only say more than that\nAnd that he would be\nWell, let's just do that\nTake some of those\nYou\nCharton\nCloser\nAll right\nYou so who's leading in the conversation very cardinous the question\nMoving\nSo cardinous question. Yes, so how's your facility going along?\nOkay, so then let's write that down. That's a good response\nYou\nHow is your facility coming along and then she says\nUm\nOh, we're just a few days away from finishing. Oh, oh, it's only a few days away\nIt's uh\nAll right, we'll be done in about a week you want to come visit\nYou want to check it out? So let's add that down\nWe'll be done in a week\nSo but is she inviting him right now. Yeah, she is she's expressing it's almost done. She wants to show him what he's done\nSo she's inviting him though. Yeah, okay, because we need to lead over responses that there\nAll right, you want to come visit it'll be over every it'll be done in a week\nLike that. Yeah, so\nUh, it'll be it'll be done in a week. You want to come over then\nThat'll be maybe done a few days when I come over. It's done\nIt'll be done over. It'll be allowed to show it. Yes. It's open space\nWell, there's still be some kind of securities\nHmm\nTypically in a distrustful society we don't lock her doors\nUh, in a distrustful side we do lock her doors. I bet\nIn a distrustful side we do lock her doors in our in a trustful side of your lock her doors\nWe do lock her doors\nOkay, well, it isn't about trust. It's just if you have labs\nIt's an overall trust. There's maybe some minimal security. Well, it's more just safety security\nYou need a layer of safety because you're gonna have chemicals and materials that are very corrosive and dangerous\nOkay, so we're gonna have like either doors or obstacles or gold or some kind. So I imagine there are doors\nThen there are the locks on important things in the house\nLike on things that we potentially hazardous I should say so the lab if it's a lab that does allow visitors\nIs it would probably allow visits into the lobby\nSome of the labs and it would only be like the extremely sensitive testing equipment\nWouldn't have visitors. Okay, yeah\nBecause I wouldn't have someone around a mass spectrometer. That is not to do it\nBecause that is at a hundred thousand dollars piece of equipment and if they fuck us it they break it\nWell, you might bring them into the basic lab. Well, you guys take the samples and do the testing because\nIt's just okay laboratory sinks and cabinets to what degree in the social space is the player allowed\nIt is his his card with permission\nProbably everywhere but the area of the expensive stuff\nOkay, so typically the only place in the lab that are locked or biological samples\nBecause it's HIPPA\nAny corrosive agents so typically acids and solutions like that and then\nTypically expensive equipment and expensive medicine samples\nThe rest of the lab is typically free roam\nBecause they know scientists are going to come in and out anytime\nThey only typically lock up the dangerous stuff the infectious stuff and the expensive stuff\nSo pretty much if she's allowed to have a visit then he would probably have free roam of the lab\nExcept for some of the most secure areas\nShe would probably wouldn't want to bring them in because so it's an expensive fix so she'd be like\nDo you want to take a tour of the lab or do you want to take a tour? Well, it'll be done a week\nThat'd be a good way to slice it\nYou want to do you want to go on a tour or do you want to\nDo you want to go on a tour?\nBecause more safety stuff than labs isn't about the theft\nYou know what they just don't want to stupid people to kill themselves\nYou would have had your flow of acid\nHave you seen what it does to people? Yeah, it fucks them up if you know that if you don't know your force\nExpose you don't realize it. Oh, that's fucked. It's a slow bone so you could get it on you\nAnd then it will be an hour or two later where you get the results\nThat's what makes hydrofolics such as it's not the fact that it's an acid is\nIt's not one that is a normal acid or you fill the effects immediately\nYou can there are stories of people touching it going the bed waking up of these giant wounds\nThat's not that you're that that's tough like a slits. It's corrosive and it fucks you up all the time\nIt told us the fat cells instead of the actual flesh\nAnd so it eats away within the flat cushion in between the flesh and the skin\nAnd then it still is eating the skin because the skin is made of fat cells and then it strips down with the red flesh on the bone\nTypically people will get it on their hands and then they'll touch their face\nSo they'll get it on their body and spread it around because like they touch the spot and they rub it around\nGeez\nYes, so that's assuming that it's hydrofolics that the other isn't glad it's super strong\nIt's just super corrosive over time unless you wash it off\nWell, that's the thing is you can't wash off because it absorbs easily into the fat of this game\nJesus\nThat's terrifying\nLike when these people handle it you're talking like the spot as big as that can be lethal in the human body\nBecause it just eats straight to the red tissue\n\n\n====== REC026.txt ======\nImagine that you're exploring this area, this world, right?\nAnd you want to go out and navigate the cold.\nThere is some danger in that.\nPeople have lost, no one's died.\nYeah, but people have lost fingers.\nThey've lost limbs.\nThey've got corrosion and noses.\nThey're face.\nSo it was one of the issues of that.\nThose that have to be extreme outweighs,\nbecause the city is able to produce its own life,\ngiving heat to have enough to build a golden in this climate.\nWe're going to have pretty damn good protection.\nThat's true.\nYou know, that's me.\nYou're right.\nEspecially if it's that symphs that you built with an irregularity.\nExactly.\nSo you would have this be like extreme anomalies.\nIt would be injuries.\nYou're right.\nSo that's kind of the issue of who you're talking to.\nBecause you painted yourself in the narrative corner\nof some pits, because you removed injuries.\nIt has to be now accidents.\nThere's no play.\nAnd that's fine.\nThat's fine.\nYou're right.\nI should remove that.\nThat's going to be a thing.\nIf you want to keep out the mystic,\nyou want to keep it in the threat of the theme.\nSo it wasn't like what I was saying.\nThe mystic's just the advanced stuff.\nWell, this is like petty shit to them at real estate.\nIn an orthic dungeon, but they have goadins in this town.\nIt's cool what I got in here at the end, you're right.\nAnyway, so try to avoid trebs, try to avoid trebs.\nSo no frostbite.\nIt's really cold, but technology's\nsufficient to keep them warm without any injuries.\nWith the advanced past, the point of injury is pretty much.\nYeah, it's not really.\nPeople live for thousands of years.\nIt's accidents, you know.\nAnd the attention on what is that?\nOne piece of technology I want to kind of give you\nis kind of infer to you.\nSeeing how there's large structures.\nI have these towers, these buildings.\nWhat if there's these little drones?\nNot drones, but like they're like 60 devices.\nNot drones, they're more of them.\nThey're safety nets.\nThey're safety balloons.\nOh, so they're looking around for movement.\nAnd if there's a ride movement, I'm like flailing\nor something standing, and then if something's falling,\nit's going to be fast.\nFast movement, it shoots in a balloon and it can catch them.\nBut here's the thing.\nSo some of the passive defense systems.\nYeah.\nSo it's for safety measures, but there's not extreme.\nSo like you're climbing a tree, there's.\nIt's not going to be people who get injured,\nbut you have technology to fix those minor injuries.\nNo, I mean, I mean, there's a people that fall off the pillow.\nBecause that's the extreme, or the pillar itself,\nor the larger structures that could kill them if they fall.\nSo they have a passive safety system.\nYeah, it's automated safety.\nYep.\nWell, that's what you call a passive, because it's not a thing\nthat has to be controlled.\nYeah, it's not a constant observing people.\nIt's just observing movement.\nIt's like, just checking it on an X.\nAnyway.\n\n\n====== REC027.txt ======\nthat it has moved beyond the conventional phase of injuries, injuries, or either going\nlead to short accidents, health problems, mishaps, or just the other case, no, dose of\nbad luck.\nYeah.\nOoh, that's going to make you know to hold.\nWell, it's more interpersonal conflict, it's not like the sci-fi setting in themselves.\nSci-fi setting is a means of curiosity.\nPeople are intrigued.\nNo, I'm intrigued.\nPlayers are intrigued.\nBut it's built around characters, for example, I mean, out awards.\nI mean, one of the areas, there's a dialogue thing with the guys, I'm like, yeah, I'm\nwalking in space, because my jewelry's too fast, we all die.\nThat one's like, wait, what?\nHe's like, yeah, don't worry, I used to hang out with him for granted, but no, I don't\nanymore.\nIt just brings up, because it just reminds you, like, hey, yeah, that's right.\nYou could die in a second, these are like colonies.\nYeah, but I'm going to call the opposite direction of that.\nNo, I know, but I just thought that was one of those.\nThat's where we went from.\nIt was you were talking like, oh, frostbite, it's like, well, wait, we have the technology\nto grow stuff here.\nYeah, it's a big deal.\nYeah, you can grow, you can imagine like having some of this, I think it was you, actually.\nYou mentioned that if someone lost a limb or whatever, you could have these temporary limbs\nthat you hold onto until you have to choose to have your own costume, so I'm nice, you\ncan have, like, placement, placement over 7 and X.\nHe was a little camel of the feet in his face, and he tried to look like an X.\nWe started talking about 7 and X, and that's the time when I've been being in a candy\none, because I've worn out this, like, a place hole.\nYeah?\nThat's just a good way of putting it.\nSo here's a question about them, and so obviously, injuries don't scare you to them.\nSo for the sake of narration, since they don't have to worry pretty much about death,\nit's kind of like an outlier for them, they don't really have to worry about injury,\nwhat we're going to need to move to an area of them is not action-situentious, but\nall of them are making the player make a choice.\nSo I'm going to try a CDN to keep walking, getting distracted, my man, I'm just frustrated\nby keeping doing this, because it's important to the

wouldn't affect you.\nI know.\nBut this is something I want to explain to me myself later on.\nI can go back to it.\nIt's a tangent from the time.\nBecause if you write the dialogue is one point.\nBut I need to flesh us out.\nSo from that secondary point, after you've gone through\nMario's interactions and the interactions in that first area.\nYou in a dark source kind of way.\nNow like you unlock a new section of the world.\nThis pillar area is on that construction.\nYou go through.\nAfter it's done.\nThis is how we'll add new content.\nBut it's also how we'll...\nBecause you expand the world way.\nBut at the same time, you give the player a temporary barrier until they've gone through a barrier\nwhich they didn't have late.\nWell, it's like a metroidvania, right?\nYou get late.\nAnd then what do you get next?\nYou get actual hands, maybe.\nMaybe you get a body.\nMaybe you get...\nMaybe it's Mario's going to get...\nGive me a body.\nYeah, but first we're going to get...\nThis is temporary.\nHmm?\nOkay, but first we have to get to the point where the AI is interacting.\nBecause all we have so far is two pieces of a conversation.\nBetween man and...\nBecause it's...\nOkay.\nWell, I think there's enough.\nI won't move on.\nSo...\n\n\n====== REC029.txt ======\nWe all are right now and start our own ways.\nThe player needs to lock the top a little bit.\nWe have an introduce to player yet.\nSo let's finish the conversation they get the player to do.\nBecause once we get the player to do,\nthen we can finish up the dialogue with Marion\nand then still flesh it off the outside.\nBecause I know we have mainly honestly about\nfive minutes of the game.\nSo let's work on another one.\nLet's do the five minutes before we build the rest of the world.\nFair point.\nLet's give this to a 10 minute point.\nAnd then we can worry about the rest of the world.\n15 minute demo.\nThe vertical slice.\nAlmost.\nYeah.\nAs I imagine, it's the first.\nIt's the only just the initial level.\nYeah.\nWe got like maybe like 30 seconds of actual content here.\nMaybe not like 15 or 5 if that.\nWe need more than 5 minutes because you have open and credits.\nProbably about a minute of music.\nAnd then a few minutes like about maybe a 30 to a minute of just\nyour eyes or your lens waking up and watching this.\nAnd that's what we've talked about at least.\nOkay.\nThat's what we've got.\nIt is, you know, working up and you hold two people,\nsay at two sentences and then you try to jump into the next one.\nI mean, I'm going to try that.\nWe got to backtrack a little bit.\nLet me move forward.\nHey, Carden.\nHey, how's your facility coming along?\nSo we've already got her response.\nShe says.\nShe said it's a week away from going,\ndo you want to take a tour?\nHey, do you want to take a tour?\nIt's almost done.\nYeah.\nBecause we already established,\nyes, the facilities have secure support\nwith the public areas available because the way the society is built.\nWe trust them.\nWe're worried about theft because it's a post-scarcity society.\nSo theft is an issue and that is injury.\nIt's just more.\nThey have any matter,\nanother dangerous shit in there.\nSo then we need to build his response,\nwhich is probably a yes,\nprobably positive and probably,\nhe's already curious about the lab.\nSo then he would probably ask,\nso he would of course say yes because of friends.\nAnd then he would probably ask,\nwhat are you researching?\nOr what do you plan to start researching?\nIt would be about a question.\nSo probably one of the lines of yesterday of course,\nbecause of friends,\nso it wouldn't be much hesitation.\nAnd then the next day would probably be,\nwhat would it be?\nWhat do you guys hope to start working on once the lab is done?\nOr does she not have a privilege yet?\nBecause now on a whole response after this.\nSo let's finish this question.\nHis response to the yes.\nSo those are positive responses.\nWe'll start with happiness.\nBecause yes.\nOh, you know what I'm saying?\nYeah, sure, that'd be great.\nAnd then the second half of the question is a question.\nAnd that is a question asking,\nwhat is your team working on?\nI hope you're still working on it.\nSo okay, we need to get rid of it.\nSo we have curiosity,\nelation,\nand we've already done desire,\nso let's get desire.\nLet's just do curiosity and elation for now.\nA curiosity, and layman.\nUh.\nCuriosity and elation itself.\nYeah, sorry.\nElation.\nI'm sorry, I'm drowning it.\nCuriosity.\nYou sure it's right?\nWait, what was that for?\nIs this one older?\nElation was that.\nBut earlier on, it was.\nAnd right to the end of the film, actually.\nI'm sure that's right.\nYeah, curiosity and elation.\nSo desire.\nSo this is wrong there.\nYes, that's what it was.\nSo his response.\nI don't know anything else.\nSo like, you know, that was a great response.\nWhy did you kill it?\nElation is the real little Jason bull.\nOh, fuck.\nAnd the desire is.\nYeah, damn it.\nJason's going to come back to this house, like, like, a madhouse.\nHere you will.\nIt'd be funny.\nWell, let's take a moment to pause.\nLook at what you have to do.\nYou have spread out sticky notes.\nWe have what looks like badly,\nbut it's fun there, right?\nWe're doing some, I feel like we're making progress.\nWe're making progress.\nWe made it.\nIt took us only four hours to come up with 10 minutes of gameplay.\nAnd for your 10 hour game,\nthat ratio we should be done in about a year or two.\nNo, it's not about timeline, but it's terrible time, right?\nWhat do you mean?\nBecause it's not going to be that fast.\nBecause...\nOh, you're right.\nI'm going to end soon.\nAnd I'll be back down to Sunday Mondays off.\nYou are correct.\nIt's not all right.\nI can't get the white curve.\nI keep making it a B.\nSo, maybe let's not get out of the symbol right now.\nNo, it's important.\nBecause this isn't getting so much more information than you realize.\nThen...\nMost people...\nI know we're going to have to eventually start using these.\nSo I'm just trying to get in the habit of using them now.\nInstead of getting the chat too.\nAnd we're like, oh, now we have to.\nIt's a good new thing.\nWell, let's just get the symbols down now.\nLet's get used to using our reference items.\nBecause I realized we're going to have to have these about the player's head.\nSo they were the...\nI went with the player that said beat.\nThe character's head.\nSo they were the player who knows what the hell is going on.\nBut damn, there's a little wheelbarrow thinking.\nIt is, but it's clever.\nIt's making to pay more information.\nNo, we can, but...\nIt's hard when you're used to explaining everything to local ones.\nBecause then now you've got to stop.\nThere's a couple of symbols that you know represent it.\nAnd then go to the conversation around those symbols.\nYep.\nBut you're using the symbols to make things that are randomly expressed by humans.\nNot only cheating.\nLike, I know why we have to use them.\nIs this a weird way of trying it?\nI think right now.\nI'm just hoping I'm bored.\nWhat's up?\nNo, my mind just likes to peel.\nHopping.\nSo I just need a ton of stimulus.\nIt's kind of perfect then, huh?\nI appreciate you saying that when I play with you,\nI'm also listening to a show and researching topics on my phone.\nYeah, and you're going to do multiple things.\nBecause I can't do that.\nI get so distracted.\nI get a focus, focus, focus.\nOkay, I get a lot to go.\nI get a lot to go.\nMy job is all glenial thinking and it's so boring at my job.\nBecause it's not challenging mentally.\nIt's only physically challenging.\nYeah, so I feel work too.\nSo, okay.\nSo that's why I research new school of vision by Isaac As well.\nYou should really do some more Isaac Arthur.\nHe's great.\nI know you're listening to him.\nLike, he gets me.\nSo Isaac As well as his father of new school of theory.\nWell, I know.\nBut I mean, there's also Isaac Arthur.\nAnd you can do both.\nThere's multiple.\nI mean.\nNo, she's not the only one.\nHe's the most recent one I'm listening to.\nI ain't got you.\nOkay.\nSo Ian, what did you say again?\nHe says, how's your first cut?\nHow was your facility coming along?\nSo he expressed...\nYou're not going to be done soon.\nYou're not going to be done soon.\nHe expresses a positive response to her question which was to the tour.\nThen he expresses what?\nOh, yeah, that'd be cool.\nOr yet?\nWell, what did you team walking on with the question?\nYeah, so it was...\nHe's still positive.\nPositive and the curiosity.\nIt was excitement.\nPleasure.\nNo.\nElation and curiosity.\nElation and then the curiosity.\nHe stores his depositivity.\nEliposit response.\nBut he switches to a question being...\nWhat?\nWhat is he asking?\nA whole resource.\nThat's right.\nHe's curious about what is the project they're going to be starting.\nSo his response would be, yeah, what do you guys know?\nIt's when are you guys starting?\nWhen are you guys starting?\nNo, it wouldn't be when.\nBecause you gave the timeline.\nThe timeline is in two weeks.\nIt would be what?\nIt would be...\nWhat are you...\nWhat are you producing?\nWhat are you researching?\nWhat is...\nWhat is the process?\nLike, what is she?\nShe is...\nBecause we know she's a scientist.\nBut is she researching?\nIs she building?\nOr is she testing?\nTesting.\nLet's say she's part of the group.\nIs she part of the science group?\nBut it's talking to Temuish.\nTemuish?\nIs that your character?\nYeah.\nIt's called Dodeck.\nThat has the body and he talks to people.\nWait, you have name for him?\nHuh?\nYeah, we talked about it on Discord a while ago.\nTemuish?\nIt means made of iron.\nI don't think I actually...\nThat's a cool name.\nWe talked about this a couple weeks ago.\nIt's in the Discord.\nBut we would be...\nThat's because of how I started helping you on this.\nHuh.\nI was just faced out.\nThat's crazy.\nThat's a good name.\nBecause that's how we came up with the patios.\nTemuish.\nSo...\nKami?\nKami.\nKami.\nKami could be the name...\nFor who?\nFor the player.\nKami.\nOh.\nSo...\nBecause Temuish is sort of what Temuish is.\nOr is that a Mongolian from Man of Iron?\nTemuish.\nTemu.\nTemu.\nOh, you're going to play out about Temuish?\nTemu.\nTo my.\nTo my?\nTo my...\nTo my...\nTemuish is an extraction of an actual war.\nBut I've already made it not a war because I only extracted the part of what I like.\nSo...\nBecause technically the net war was Temuish.\nTemu.\nHey, Temuish.\nAnd I showed it to Temuish.\nTemuish.\nSo...\nWhy do we not become a weapon with the patios, man?\nBecause we make it too close to another character.\nSo we're going to assume a connection that's not there.\nWell, that's why I have all the names of different cards.\nSo...\nMaureen and Wilmet.\nOkay.\nSo...\nDo you want any of the players?\nOr do you want any of the players of the freedom of the name themselves?\nWell, we want the...\nWe want the...\nThey don't have a name yet.\nSo they...\nAnd they can't speak.\nSo they're just given...\nThey're given a name.\nAnd the player...\nOh, you know what we could do?\nWe're going to have Temuish is just the placeholder name of the species\nuntil the assignment name.\nWell, I was thinking the species name would be the edict.\nNo, I mean, not the actual one, but the one that they call it.\nOh.\nLike a critical...\nIt's a...\nIt's a dimension.\nWe're not a dimension, but they just call them Temuish when they're small like that.\nTemuish.\nOkay.\nBecause...\nIt is a Temu, a Temu.\nYeah, it gives them something they call the player when the player can introduce themselves.\nAnd it's not...\nI had a day gone, it's not dough day.\nOkay.\nIt's a Temuish.\nOkay, I like that.\n\n\n====== REC030.txt ======\nYeah, it sounds almost empathetic. It's like a little, yeah. So the player's name is, or the name is regarded as\nTemu. That is the name of the Dodax. They're like, hey, doggo, hey, Temu. But it's more empathetic, it's more human, it's more, it's just a empathetic as it should be.\nIt's a way to empathize with it since they can't describe a little of the names. It doesn't have a name, so they give it a...\nA name of a placeholder. Yeah, a nickname or a placeholder. Until I can express itself and choose a name. That's cool though. Temu.\nTemu. Temu. That's why that is wheelies in some...\n\n\n====== REC031.txt ======\nThey don't really. The trout doesn't need a name until the first year.\nBecause until then they believe the guys might claim the child.\nBecause it's just a hole over from where we found three, so it's so terrible we'd know.\nAnd death rates are so terribly high.\nWe would have six kids only two would live.\nThey had infants dying, and so if we were cultural, we don't name the baby before the\nfour-year-old. It has to own its name.\nThat's pretty crazy. A lot of cultures won't cut their hair for the\nlast year for that same reason.\nLiterally we cut the child's hair with bad luck.\nOr invite spirits to it.\nYeah, there's so much weight superstition.\nThis is for the map.\nI don't know if I should ask you for some design.\nCrazy.\nI can go over here and project it, actually.\nI've got enough still. This is the second or the thing to do later.\nThis is how I'm using now.\nPat that pat.\nDon't need a phone right now.\nYou must either sleep fucking, be free, be focused.\nWe've been in the long tangent.\n\n\n====== REC032.txt ======\nSo he says, yeah, sure.\nHave you guys figured out you need a project?\nOh.\nFigure it out?\nWait, because she might have...\nSo she's working with team.\nIt means that they have to come up with consensus on the topic\nthat they're gonna research.\nAnd maybe she doesn't know yet,\nbecause we haven't figured out a whole place on the team.\nMaybe it's whole lab,\nbecause she's a member of the team.\nBut it doesn't mean she's a leader.\nWell, Marion's the engineer.\nShe's a equal part of the team.\nYou don't know.\nYou're cooking upon it.\nI'm talking about for the science side.\nBecause we're talking about...\nOh.\n...cliffs.\nWe don't know who's placed on the team.\nOh, okay.\nSo if you want to fix the point,\nbecause you said you wanted to tie to 10-ish,\nthe order one.\nWell, I mean, we could make a team made of the scientists\nthat we'll be talking about, the broken Dodeck.\nBecause that would bring all of our narrative points\nfull-sourced votes then.\nBecause the player wouldn't know yet,\nbut all the connections would be the Dodeck.\nBut the player doesn't realize he's the Dodeck.\nHe's only seen his hands in the ball.\nHe gains more symbols over time.\nThank you.\nMore symbols over time.\nNo, no, no.\nBut, so, you've only shown the player his upper torso\nwith his head and his hands and his legs.\nRight, but then they're showing him that he's a Dodeck.\nSo it starts on first person,\nbut then as soon as you see yourself, it's in their person.\nBut does he see it in the back?\nBecause you don't have to notice it.\nWell, let's say it seems to you expand.\nAs soon as you...\nLet's see.\nHow can I do it?\nI can take when you like to do it.\nNo, you don't see the back of your head.\nYeah, I've had you.\nSo, imagine...\nWhen the player sees the mirror,\nthey suddenly...\nThe screen goes dark.\nYou see himself.\nThe screen goes...\nIt kind of jumbles up.\nRight, just down.\nAnd we forget it.\nOpen.\nYou got recording?\nNo.\nBut it does...\nIt goes dark.\nAnd...\nYou can look around the player.\nYou can navigate around.\nAnd they see his points of light.\nThey reach toward the first point of light.\nThey touch it.\nAnd then it expands outward.\nIt branches outward.\nThe player is thrust out into the world\nand they're in third person.\nThey're now speaking to the word\nyou, I, one, self.\n\n\n====== REC033.txt ======\none self. Oh my gosh I'm gonna tell people who shit. Oh that horse. I mean it's good\ndialogue but all I can think of is whack or lose trying to sell bullshit. It's just my\nparanoia person myself ignore it. I'll probably just pull it off then that last piece.\nNo no it's no that's a really good introspective phrase but for me you know\nI want to whack a dude who's a they cover up how they do this so hard. Hang on let me\nshoot some of your shots too. The word to say. So heads up A3 Lovecraft is a racist\nasshole before you get to the rest of it. I'm not gonna lie it's a heads up on that.\nI don't think I'm gonna. But he was in the 20s and it's not like he was super racist he was just\nhe was his racist. Ted. But because it was the 20s so not what you could do back then I suppose.\nI just don't want you to be surprised if you look at Lovecraft and you find a bunch of\nother things about that. Did you see it?\n\n\n====== REC034.txt ======\nwell\nI am good\nDon't know a thing.\nFuturistic, underdeveloped,\nRobotic, Android-type, vegetable thing?\nWait.\nAsk it and quit.\nAsk again.\n\n\n====== REC035.txt ======\nMore time asked that. What do you ask? Oh, I said it's a\nDo you have familiar with the time like I'm like it's the\nAngel vegetable tank. Okay, let me try to just joking around. Oh, you know what? Yeah\nYou know it looks like though\nI know it looks like I'm just joking because you said we sprouted out of the wall. That's what the vegetables they came from\nBut that I that's the I need a reference of Damon\nOh, I hope it seems I'm I should have seen\nOh\nI'm not sure what your machines in there yet. What's up? I'm not sure what your machines in there yet\nWhat do you mean?\nWell, I had some robots. Oh, yeah, it's my reference to steer, but I think I think they're I think they're in your chat actually\nOne of us maybe they're in Roberts chat actually now some of them are here, see?\nOh, there's one of them, but I think I haven't heard the rest. There's a lot more I need to put on your damn\nNow we have something to bury\nBut I have more I know I have more. Oh, keep going on\nWell, they're buried in they go from robots because we were supposed to be robots and statues\nIt was both at the same time. I try pull us off from a post. So everything is buried in with each other to see what's in the real behind\nThose more the aesthetics\nThose move the robots\nIt's kind of just mixed up. Okay, we got it. We got to mix it and on the cell same. We got to figure out a way to organize this\nWhat if we have references in the top world? Oh my god\nThen I'm gonna do the work. I can't do it actually. I mean, I mean maybe you moderate it. You can join me in this\nOh, no, no, you're on your\nNo, no, because I need I need you. I need this computer with you to articulate the different\nSo I'm trying to discover that use my words because if I keep it's not here then\nYeah\nYeah, the robots\nWell, we don't need to describe the TEMMU, the TEMMUSHA the TEMMUSHA TEMMUHA TEMMUHA\nThe TEMMA\nIt's a temporary body, so it's not going to be any special\nYou said that there are so\nFruble with those supplies, so the homes are skeletal. It's tens of you. I mean the pieces are located in the chest\nSo what if what if most TEMMU most of them are\nGofully fledged they have the most of them are actually more machined and more animalistic life\nMajority of them are animalistic like but at some point at some of the so few of the TEMMU are humanoid by pedal there\nThere's social the same way we are they express the same way are the use of music and body language to convey thoughts and feelings\nBut they don't have facial expressions and they don't have traditional words\nYeah, so they use the\nEdict the\nNot the edict the\nthe\nThe effects on the dough deck as in the body\nImagining that they have a very defined chest\nBut Lucidine bones think about it more like\nWas it more close to the guy in the middle did I show you this one?\nYeah, you showed me that already. Yeah, yeah, they had that more silicone like well\nNo, but I was talking about for like the temp bodies because we're not gonna make everybody that the fact if it's temp\nBody, they're gonna do something a skeletal like this just to control resources. Okay, so the right. It's just\nBecause if you already said that she gave him a body because it was just a camera. Okay, I brought a torso with him\nAnd then when they get to the lab, she's going to give him legs to imagine the temp body being this is not something that happens often, right?\nYeah, they're not fully prepared for it. So I was they're giving you shut down pieces or what if they get what if they get a player components of robots\nThat around the area like these are spare parts that can use them to give it a body. No, I know\nBut that's why I was thinking like instead of a whole chest piece, but it's all fully figured it filled in to define more like bastion\nYeah, well that's what this is because if you look this is mainly just\nI think that's the advanced version maybe\nThe she's one of the poor people. This is one of the lower and yeah\nBut it's in order the in order the background in order the expression during the context. Yeah, I'm just living exclusively at this piece if you look this is an illusion\nThese are all more placed if you look behind it. It's empty. It's in space. It's too. I'm right. Yeah, you're right\nSo I have a human wouldn't have these all these pieces. I have to show you some references. I've got some good ones, but\nThey're not a hurt go here. Oh\nYeah, see I figured this would be the final version because it's completely go ahead and post that real quick. That's good\nJPEC\nJump present\nAll right\nYou have seven right in there\nSeven seven oh\nWhat do you have\nThat's great perfect\nSo that's the advanced piece\nWill we say that this one is the beginner go to\nThat's the context to kind of rinse it. What do you mean the context makes this look more vile?\nBut it is it's because you have the arms you have the armor or you want to be alert. You want to do me over calm. So imagine\nWell, it's not over. It's just space pieces. I've got more references home, but I got\nBut ration up there real quick\nSo keep writing because we gotta keep pushing this conversation. You're right\nUh\nGo with something more something work. That one's pretty passive one. Yeah\nSo what response are we on\nChris response over here\n\n\n====== REC036.txt ======\nthat can lay a simple system in, and then somehow I'm going to go to a hotel who can't speak\nor interact and only watch or not.\nFor now, but then they can't.\nYeah, but, I mean, that's what we're all trying to do at once right now.\nSo we're just, that's why it's taking so long.\nOkay, so what actually will fleshed out spaces will be easier?\nBecause here I know we don't even have a makeup tutorial yet.\nWe'll kind of flush it out with everything.\nOkay.\nThat's why it seems to be taking us so long.\nOnce we get everything defined, the next session, we'll get more productive as we figure it out.\nI think you're right.\nSo, alright, just real quick.\nHow would you hate pardon?\nHow's your facility coming along?\nWhat's that?\nOh, you want to take a tour?\nBefore he said yes he wants to tour.\nIt'll be done on Tuesday, whatever.\nAnd then he says,\nWell, who are you?\nWe've already answered this.\nWe've answered this three times.\nI know, yeah, but I gotta keep, I put it back my head.\nOkay.\nI'm responding to a positive response so properly.\nYes, of course.\nThen he asks what kind of research is your team looking into storing?\nWell, what is the project that you're going to be doing here?\nSo he says, he says.\nBecause he's not.\nYeah, I know what a project is.\nHe's trying to figure out what a project is.\nOr this aspect.\nYeah, you know, I'm kind of curious.\nWhat are you guys working on?\nI mean, or, yeah.\nYeah.\nWhat's your project about?\nOh, they had to be great.\nWhat's your project about?\nNo, that's all right.\nThat's the second time he told me that it'd be great.\nHe haven't ended down.\nNo, it doesn't sound right.\nI'm trying to get the saying, right?\nWhat do you mean?\nIt's not natural enough.\nIt's not.\nI can't act it, right?\nBecause it's not genuine enough.\nIt's not genuine enough.\nLike the fight, I can't even fight.\nRemember, he is elated.\nYeah, he is.\nAnd he's asking what a project is about.\nHe's elated and desirable.\nSo how do you write that out without being?\nWell, so he doesn't know what it is.\nSo we got to keep it there.\nMaybe he's too excited.\nYeah.\nBecause he's either.\nI think you're envisioning him way more excited than he should be.\nYeah, you're right.\nSo what?\nSo just...\nFush out like this.\nForget the rest of the world.\nTopless marbles.\nAll focused on all these two specific people.\nThat's all you're gonna focus on these two people.\nAnd they were talking about a project that one is really excited about.\nShe's getting a brand new advertorial, and she's never been here.\nShe's going to use it.\nShe's friends with the person that she's talking to.\nBut she may not have told them what the project is.\nSo his response is not, if you've feel it as your friend,\nshe just got a new lever.\nsomething she's been looking forward to. She just said it's finished, but you\ndon't know the project is it's going to be naturally curious for you to ask what\nit is. So what would be a short brief? I don't know. You just said it. What's your\nproject? I don't know. That would you describe the situation. You describe\ntheir context. You need to give it to me. No, I said it was a question a while ago.\nI said you just have to ask what's the project about? What's the project about?\nOkay, so just stop that. Yeah. You don't need to have any complex thing. He's not\nthe focus of the conversation. He feels he's saying he's not going to express\nthem. What's that you want to know? What's the project about? I just casually\nwrite. Wait, he's elated because she got the lab and he's curious because he\ndoesn't know what the project is. How's your facility coming along? Hey, how's\nyour facility coming along? You want to take a tour? Oh yeah, if you want to take\na tour, it'll be done on Tuesday. So we don't need to give it a specific day. Well,\nit'll be done soon. There you go. Yeah, it'll soon. And then you have him responding.\nOf course, I'll take it to what is he doing. Yeah, sure. I'll take a tour.\nOh, yeah, I'll check it out. No, yeah, I'll check it out. Oh, yeah, I don't want to\ncheck it out. Yeah, I won't check it out. Yeah, I'll check it out. Sure. Sure, that'd be cool.\nThat'd be great. With a nice facial mark or not? No. How this is the last thing you've\ndone. So who responds to that? I don't do. We have to play with him at this point.\nShe now she explains you. Sure, that'd be great. No, I know that, but so do we have the player\ncoming before she answers or as she answers because we got to figure out one of the dialogue points\nto break up with information. Interesting here. I've got to know you. So what if, what if\na card speaks again? So this doesn't know what to say. She's thinking about it a lot.\nShe's thinking about it too much. Just for a brief second. She gives it positive thought.\nAnd then card and steps and again to clarify. What kind of research are you guys doing?\nWell, we're kind of we're kind of research you guys doing. You really want to ask that question?\nWhat kind of, what kind of, what kind of, what do you guys, what are you guys working on?\nOh, no, let's just stick to the research ones so you can get out of your system.\nWhat are you guys working on? So what do you just, what do you decide to work on?\nWell, so that's how we're going to do the product instead, isn't it?\nYeah, but we decide isn't like it's like you have an option to you have control over it.\nThey work, this is not control of the government. Why are you assuming I'm saying control again?\nI don't know. I need to assume that's being conveyed to dialogue that this is not the thing.\nBut that's why he's saying your project. He's not saying a project. He's like, what is your project?\nWhat's your project done? What's your project? What product did you decide on?\nThat's what we just asked you. Yeah. It will show what's the project.\nNo, it says, sure, that'd be great. And then he says again, sure.\nYou want to take it toward? We're done on Tuesday. Sure, yeah, be great.\nAnd then that was mostly pre-faith. I mean, it's what's the end of a question of what's the project?\nYeah, what's the project? But this is when she pauses.\nBut why not just make it one question?\nBecause it's more natural conversation. You're trying to emphasize that there are pauses in human conversation.\nThat real conversation isn't just about.\nBecause here's what you're having to walk out. You're having to say, this is a casual conversation.\nNo, I know, but you just have this real break that I'm trying to figure out.\nIt's very, very minute, but in human conversation, when we're thinking, we could pause on that,\nliterally about three seconds sentence out. And then he says more. He says this sentence.\nAnd then he says again, he pauses for a second. Just long enough or not to interrupt.\nAnd he jumps in and he says, pause though. That's not.\nIt's a very subtle pause. He's thinking and then reclerifying.\nHe says this and say, oh wait, no, I want to express this.\nSo, the project is an umbrella tone that would cover the resource.\nThe project is this the broad umbrella tone of what is she walking on?\nOkay, so, what do you think is she saying it's done?\nI think she's new on to her response.\nSure, that big green. What are you guys working on? And then she says, it's your story.\nOkay, yeah, yeah. All right.\nSure, that big green. Yeah, what are you guys working on?\nYeah, what are you guys working on? Yeah, what are you guys working on?\nYeah, what are you guys?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nGuys.\nYeah, what are you guys working on?\nSo, you mentioned she's a bioengineer, so let's stay up to that topic.\nWhat do you think she might talk about?\nYou said she's a bioengineer, so...\nSo, actor Genesis?\nMaybe, um...\nSo, why would the...\nSo, what is your research?\nShe...\nBioengineering.\nMaybe you're...\nWhat is she specifically working on about bioengineering?\nImagine that there is a lot of data.\nWe haven't fully accepted through yet, or fully understood, so...\nImagine we're pie...\nStill piecing together the biological record of Earth.\nBecause there's stuff we can't speculate on.\nWe need philosophy and science, and we're considering mathematics.\nSo, why are we worried about it if they're on a different planet?\nWell, I need another system, another...\nImagine they have DNA archives, and they're going through archives,\nand they're trying to improve the plant life that exists.\nThey're trying to reinforce it further than it is.\nBecause they want to expand further out.\nThe further you build, the more robust these plants have to be,\nto survive the cold or weather.\nThat's what it is now, just rebuild what...\nThat was the technology they have keeping the plants alive, whatever they are.\nWell, it's more about making...\nBecause as it goes further in front of the structure,\nfar from the tower, things get colder.\nSo, you know, so here's the issue.\nYou've demonstrated the mass of the cold.\nThey're not...\nYou're right.\nSo, it's not that.\nSo, what would be...\nI'm going to be pessimistic again.\nLet me try that again.\n\n\n====== REC037.txt ======\nThere's no issue with them, there's no issue with them, there's no issue with them, there's no issue

next question\ndo we have the AEI coming now?\nWhat do we carry on with that?\nOh,\nmy idea was, is having\nasked for the question and then the AEI come in,\nand then we just drop the question.\nWell, how long can the player wait and listen?\nWell, so honestly what you have is probably about a minute of conversation,\nonce this is actually what's accumulated.\nHow long do you think the player might wait and just\nbefore I didn't realize it could have the proper screened down the booth,\nlike I said, a little prompt, hey, you can move with the left stick.\nWell, I wouldn't say that, but I would.\nMaybe have, so you said that they notice him, right?\nMaybe as he's talking, since she's looking,\noh, he's looking that way.\nAnd we're on her response, correct?\nSo have it all be getting her response and have him wave.\nI'm not necessarily talking.\nHe's still paying attention to the whole,\nbut I have to be looking wave.\nSo the player comes to him.\nSo what if, what if, what if the, what if the,\nwhat if the, that's going to be wild to the notice him?\nSo what if the conversation starts as soon as the player breaks free of this little,\nit's a, um,\nit's a protective shell over it because it's been a long time,\nand the player is tapped, like,\nlike, you're breaking through an egg, right?\nAnd you're, you play your city sprouted out of the wall though.\nIt is sprouted out of the wall.\nIt's waiting, but it's not, it's not hatched yet,\nper se.\nThey know where they see it.\nIt's advanced in this area.\nBut then it, it's, it's like the player,\nyou imagine the player's perspective, right?\nYou're, you're a camera,\nand you're in this enclosure you see.\nSo you moved with left straight.\nThat doesn't work.\nOkay, you hit it.\nYou move with right stick.\nOkay.\nSo you moved both, you know,\noh,\nyou break through.\nSo you have to,\nthis teaches the player to use left stick and right stick.\nWithout them, you can have them now.\nPlus, that has to do with the conversation at all.\nBecause as soon as they break through,\nthey're aware.\nOkay.\nSo it's, it's going to play notes that\nas soon as the player figures it out,\nthey can move.\nYou know, it's accidental.\nThey're like, oh, cool.\nAnd they're through, you know,\nthey do two at once,\nand then they...\nGame design, ideas, sorry.\nNo, you guys are like,\nwhat does it have to do with the conversation?\nI'm trying to reduce the overall scope of the conversation.\nWe're trying to keep it minimal.\nSo it, the immediate conversation,\nif you break through the shell,\nas soon as the player finds out how to move.\nSo I'm trying to make that break point as well.\nOkay, we get right now.\nWe make a little bit more dialogue,\nbecause the player could take a little longer.\nSo let's say...\nOh, so literally...\n30 seconds.\nI'm not even talking about that.\nI'm talking about ending the conversation now.\nI'm talking about,\nhave him foam half a thought,\nand then the player comes in.\nOkay, half a...\nOkay.\nSo we're kind of...\nwe're working on the player profiles.\nAnd then having them...\nI'm still asking,\noh, what kind?\nAnd then just end the dialogue\nand have the player come in.\nAnd then we just tone the focus to the player.\nWhat would you say,\noh, what would subset?\nWhat subset of color profiles?\nOh, what subset?\nWell, you never realize\nhe's not into that kind of resource,\nso you're finding out...\nOh, what kind of...\nWhat kind of...\nHuh.\nWhat kind of...\nWell, you don't have to finish it.\nJust stop it at what kind,\nand then do dot dot dot to show a break.\nAnd then the player comes in.\nIt's interesting.\nWhat kind?\nAnd see,\nthen we end it there,\nthe player comes in,\nand then we decide where it goes from there.\nUnless you want to take a break.\nUm...\nYeah, let's take a trip break.\nThat's...\nIt's...\nYes.\nIt's interesting.\nThat's interesting.\nWhat kind?\nAnd then the player breaks through the breaks to the glass.\nPlayer at turn.\nIdeally.\nWe've gone up to 8 minutes about it again, right?\nWell, 10 now,\nhe strikes the breaking scene.\nThis is an event so like...\nI'm not sure if it's going to happen.\nI'm not sure

are you guys working on?\nThat's more curiosity.\nThat would have been great because of the A guy was coming in.\nWell, that's his.\nBut they're breaking it here.\nThat's interesting.\nWhat kind?\nEnd of breaks.\nBut I still want to convey the intent.\nWritten out.\nWhat do you mean by that?\nYou get the symbols.\nI have got one, two, three here without symbols.\nAnd that's saying that any exercise the language right in my head?\nSo, what do you turn to accomplish?\nI'm trying to accomplish the eating based intent.\nReconciliation link.\nNo, I know what I'm talking about.\nSo, pick one.\nAnd this will do the thing.\nYou can't go through all the ones you need to pick one to start with.\nOkay.\nYeah, we're guys working on it.\nBut yeah, we're guys working on it.\nSo, the curiosity.\nCan you ask me?\nThat's a nice break.\nCome on, I'm here.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nSo, curiosity has a desire.\nYeah, which has worked on it.\nOkay.\nAnd...\nDesiring and...\nI think it's just genuine curiosity by itself.\nAnyway, so we're working on profiles.\nWorking on failure profiles.\nI don't know.\nIt was curiosity and...\nAnd it was curiosity and it says, I think, that's prototype.\nIf the intensity of curiosity.\nOkay, so...\nHigh intensity.\nThis one.\nLow intensity is two, three intensities.\nOkay.\nRemember...\n\n\n====== REC038.txt ======\nYou remember, um, Sekiro?\nOr Simba's?\nImagine the brightest symbol in the system,\nbeing like it's pure curiosity, pure aggression,\npure anxiety, whatever.\nAnd you have two symbols that you're dividing it.\nAnd now you have, they're medium brightness,\nand then, uh, three, and it's slow as brightness.\nSo that represents intensity.\nBut overall, all represents the division at which we have our\nexpressions, have our, um, what do we call them, effects.\n\n\n====== REC039.txt ======\nYeah we're working on flyer profiles.\nOh, that's interesting, that's interesting, that's what we're talking about, that's interesting.\nSo at this point

and pride, empathy and pride, that's interesting, that's interesting,\nokay, that's interesting, we're kind, minor curiosity, so we're, we're moderate curiosity,\nso that's desire, oh that's interesting, we're kind, and desire and misery, desire and aversion,\nno desire and empathy, all right, you use empathy if you're too in a situation,\n\n\n====== REC040.txt ======\nShe's attached to

see.\nLet's try your documents.\nWe're going to put your downloads.\nOne second.\nOne second.\nI know why I did this yesterday.\nIt can't get hot.\nWhat's up?\nIt's an incinerator.\nIt's an

one.\nSave us.\nCan you try it again?\nWhat's up?\nHow'd you fix it?\nWe'll hang it up with paint.\nSo we saved this one.\nAnd we just got this one with it.\nOh.\nSave us.\nOr it's that you still save us, can you?\nWell, I see.\nAre you sure if the chance is of the J-packs?\nIs it?\nI don't know.\nI don't know.\nI don't know.\nIt's kind of there.\nI'll just draw it down like that.\nI don't know.\nCool.\nThey save us, can you do so?\nWell, I say, when we download it,\nI don't know when this happens.\nOh, yes.\nAnd then, we get that one.\nThese are all those.\nAnd then we get them already.\nI thought you draw them.\nYou just laid it.\nOkay.\nAnd five, no, it's here.\nSix.\nNo, that's the yesterday.\nWe're going to do the five here.\nWe're going to do the five here.\nWe're going

anything I downloaded today?\nOh.\nDid it save you your exports tomorrow?\nJust give me a second, please.\nYeah.\nLet's see, calm down.\nYou're fine.\nSorry.\nOkay, so let's finish this up.\nAll right.\nSo, what are we stuck on?\nWe're doing something.\nWe're not stuck on anything now.\nWe got past it.\nThe players are reduced.\nAnd now we have to...\nOkay.\nSo, symbols are there.\nAll of them?\nYeah.\nUm...\nI'm going to go back and say that this...\nOkay.\nIs there anything there?\nUm...\nIs there anything there?\nWell, then I've got this thing, man.\nUh, should I take a picture of the bunch from us?\nYeah.\nWell, because we're not going to keep this up.\nFrom.\nWe're going to save them on the right, silly.\nI find that you have a picture here.\nYou can see it's real.\nLike I don't know.\nI'm going to try the one.\nI found some space in the middle of it.\nAnd from a magic door.\nI'll still have it.\nI'll just take this

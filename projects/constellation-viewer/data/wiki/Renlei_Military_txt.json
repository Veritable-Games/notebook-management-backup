Whn tey reach firing distance, the droids swerve to face their right side at the enemy and raise the round shield mounted at the side of the body. When doing this they simultaneously bounce and unfold their body, keeping the shield suspended in place with gyroscopes and an extended arm. They flip to unfold their legs, compress the body and extend their head. The legs land first, the mid section folds, and the body snapes into place, the head swivels out and the left arm swings to reveal their primary weapon.\r\nThe shield is mounted to the droid's right arm. if the player destroys the shield, the droid's right arm remains intact. Doing this evoke's an expression of 'surprise' in them and leavs the droid open for a kill as it tries to dart for cover, the droid will remain stationary and attempt to dodge projectiles if there isn't any open cover.\r\n\r\n- Excavation Droid\r\n\r\n- Heavy Combat Droid\r\n\r\n- Mining Drone\r\n\r\n- Refabrication Droid\r\n\r\n- Renlei Soldier\r\n\r\n- Sniper Droid\r\n\r\n- Transport Droid\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/Renlei_Military.txt.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, weapon\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.070Z",

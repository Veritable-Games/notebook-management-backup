The screen prompts them to push forward with L2 if they're not\naware of common movement systems, and they'll tap the light by tapping the\nanalog stick. They'll tap it, but it's like they move towards it, the moon is\nfast, they know they're moving, they know that analog stick is the one they've\npressed, so they lash out as an entity that you see the body of now. You lash it\nagain to the right, but this time it's then it's the turn, turn the body to the\nright, so that you see a flash to your right as their person came up, so then\nwell how do you turn a character to the right? You use the right stick. Okay so now\nthe character moves to the right, a snake-like entity moves to the right, and\nthen suddenly there's a flash above you. What is the player press, the player? Right\nup or right down, intuition being up, and that determines whether or not they're\ntheir left stick camera is inverted or uninverted. Okay, and then from there,\nstarting back a bit.\n\n\n====== REC008.txt ======\nIf that version happens, I'm betting it over here, he's being cozy.\nYou're so cute.\n\n\n====== REC009.txt ======\nOk, so after they've moved forward, left-stick, to confirm forward, they've moved right with\nright-stick in the intuitive direction, which is right with the analog stick.\nAnd they've moved upwards with the left-stick, when either inversion, now you want them to\nuse both at once. So now there's an entity to the... now they have a third-person camera\nthat's falling, crawling behind, the camera zoomed in after it went to the right, in the overhead\nview. Um, anyway. Yeah, I could do it well. You're right. I should totally.\nYes. I know what to do. I've got this, um, sorry, pathology, do you want to place\nabout by this more important?\n\n\n====== REC010.txt ======\nOkay, another crazy cool idea. What if inside this, this sphere, what if inside this sphere?\nThe player moves through these controls to learn the basic movement. It's really quick, it's really quick process that happens\nand it was instantaneously or takes while depending on how long the player takes to learn. It takes to do their correct movements.\nI don't know, they can do either way, but it's gonna keep blinking until they get it right.\nSo if most people should be pretty intuitive, they don't go forward, go right, go up, go left, go down.\nBut you're just testing the one of either if they do it right the first time.\nYeah.\n\n\n====== REC011.txt ======\nImagine in Dotaque and going deeper and deeper and deeper and instead of a sphere of these\nsystems.\nAt some point you have an actual model, a character running around jumping and grabbing stuff\nin.\nOh!\nThat's the actual game, dammit.\n\n\n====== REC012.txt ======\nOkay, so how do you distinguish the internal phase from how you make a floaty, make it interesting?\nYou have the player kind of flutter around the space instead of sliding forward and backwards.\nHad him standing still at the point at some point, but then they float towards the direction of light\npops up on the exterior of the space.\nThe interior white space, the white and red space, that's for comprehension that is for\ncontemplation and such.\n\n\n====== REC013.txt ======\nThe planet shell does not rotate, but the planet facing the sun does.\n\n\n====== REC014.txt ======\nIdeas for expression\nCharacter expression\n\n\n====== REC015.txt ======\nSo imagine grabbing your necklace and kind of twisting around and fiddling with your necklace\nwith your fingers while talking or first thing or thinking.\n\n\n====== REC016.txt ======\nBasing.\nFemte Chin.\nArms crossed. Arms partially folded.\nGestures.\nThe dusting glasses.\nDusting hat.\nDusting clothes.\n\n\n====== REC017.txt ======\nScratching body, scratching face, picking lips, scrubbing eye.\n\n\n====== REC018.txt ======\nThe exterior of the LST other grows back like tree bark.\nThe sewage and living there can easily remove pieces,\nand utilize those pieces for construction,\nbreak them down for materials.\n\n\n====== REC019.txt ======\nThe parent plan is immense. It's at 16 times, 12 times the size of the planet.\nThat's due to the distance it'll need to travel.\n\n\n====== REC020.txt ======\nMake the Atlas Tether's more tree-like, give the root system, connect them to the, uh,\nconnect them around the core of the planet.\nHave these systems connect into the parent planet when it opens up,\nsplit the parent planet into a model of core interior. Have these connections\nhave the Atlas Tether's leads, leads outside to the external of the, uh, structure.\nHave you created a second set of Atlas Tethers?\nAdjacent.\n\n\n====== REC021.txt ======\nThe Ring World does not have engines attached to it and does not have storage, it's actually a Ring World.\n\n\n====== REC022.txt ======\nMy elosism isn't the issue. It's cynicism.\n\n\n====== REC023.txt ======\nWe will figure out the universe before the first human reaches a thousand.\n\n\n====== REC024.txt ======\nTo reiterate, we will...\n\n\n====== REC025.txt ======\nBy the time the first human reaches a thousand years old, we'll have figured out the universe.\n\n\n====== REC026.txt ======\nThe center of the Milky Way is dense with stars.\nThat's the point you need to go to first, not the nearby stars.\nYou go to...\nWell, you can get both, really, because these werefer sets,\nand it will settle it.\nBut already though, it was the center.\nYou're spread out from there.\n\n\n====== REC027.txt ======\nCity is networks like the vascular system.\n\n\n====== REC028.txt ======\nUncontact a heat sink system for the planet. Use the Atlas Pillars and use the Ring World.\nAnd don't forget about the parent planet.\n\n\n====== REC029.txt ======\nThe Alice pillar has continual water, but the water is hot, boiling hot, but it gets cold over time.\nIt's like a...\nIn the water is pure.\n\n\n====== REC030.txt ======\nAt the top of these active support structures, there is an oporous light system.\n\n\n====== REC031.txt ======\nTethers both regulate their own temperature and the temperature around them.\n\n\n====== REC032.txt ======\nclouds are produced at the top of the Ellis tethers, and wind carries them away.\nIt's their scalding hot clouds, but they cool down over time.\nAnd the water that accumulates on the sides kind of slides down,\nwarm droplets, and destroying the rivers.\n\n\n====== REC033.txt ======\nWhat is the radius of the sun?\n\n\n====== REC034.txt ======\ntheland and Yudith.\n\n\n====== REC035.txt ======\nFind a deal placement for\nparent planet in the scene\n\n\n====== REC036.txt ======\nThe matter material is lightweight, durable and photosynthetic.\nIt converts photons into electricity via a photosynthetic process.\n\n\n====== REC037.txt ======\nI'm crystallized material won't do any long-term damage if someone touches it, but it will shock you hard.\n\n\n====== REC038.txt ======\nThat material absorbs heat and energy and pulls it back into the Alice Tether.\nOnly on contact.\nThe water vapor that comes to the top of the Alice Tether, the form of clouds.\nThat is, it's water, pure water.\n\n\n====== REC039.txt ======\nThe crystalline structure siphons of excess heat and electricity are just electricity, really.\nThey're just heat, really.\nInto any doda I could touch it.\n\n\n====== REC040.txt ======\nEnergy stored within the crystalline structure is inert until acts upon by\nHeat to set the particles of electromagnetic particles to the edge of the surface\n\n\n====== REC041.txt ======\nThe way you're setting particles to exert energy.\n\n\n====== REC042.txt ======\nWhat if the University work at Taurus, less like a sphere?\nYou know, that middle pinch point being the center of gravity, the center of mass.\nThat would explain why there's no super-automatic, mega-galactic black hole.\n\n\n====== REC043.txt ======\nSo the Alice Show has a slabs for bark, like a tree, but more like a, I don't know,\na visual for it.\nBut it works.\n\n\n====== REC044.txt ======\nbelongingness, loneliness, wanting to socialize, wanting to be in the group. What is that?\n\n\n====== REC045.txt ======\nanxiety and aversion and dissipation\n\n\n====== REC046.txt ======\nanxiety and want is also a dissipation.\n\n\n====== REC047.txt ======\nThe sides of the dough deck are where the post material should be, so the faces should be white and the sides should be false.\n\n\n====== REC048.txt ======\nI got your stress, I could. Did it go legs yet?\n\n\n====== REC049.txt ======\nExpressions without a selected symbol appear as dots.\n\n\n====== REC050.txt ======\nSymbols with like dots cannot be interact with, cannot be expressed via the player.\n\n\n====== REC051.txt ======\nAnd then pleasure symbols are internal, like depression and contentiveness, they're involuntary reactions.\n\n\n====== REC052.txt ======\nYou're putting your legs on, putting the car's legs on, now it feels fine.\nIt's fine, pleasure and relation.\n\n\n====== REC053.txt ======\nPainter and pleasure are felt before this.\nChrist, take this.\n\n\n====== REC054.txt ======\nPain and pleasure are felt before they can be expressed.\n\n\n====== REC055.txt ======\nThe endless chelars are like giant duke collectors, and there's so much surface area that they'll provide enough water for a slow-moving stream.\nMultiple.\nThe water for entire civilization, but not rapidly, just slowly.\nThey can filter, preserve, and store it. Utilize it.\n\n\n====== REC056.txt ======\nPain in pleasure or not?\nPain in pleasure symptoms, they're negative stimuli\nand positive stimuli.\n\n\n====== REC057.txt ======\nThese reactions can happen slowly or gradually, but well often not, for example, if you touch the hot pain in the stimuli, you feel something good, those are stimuli.\nIs it related? And those can change depending on the context and the behavior.\n\n\n====== REC058.txt ======\nplayers put us in bed if they take in certain wavelengths radiation to get\nenergy and water of course\n\n\n====== REC059.txt ======\nEmiliate plans, but don't be afraid to try away from, say, heat radiation or solar radiation.\nThere's Apple.\n\n\n====== REC060.txt ======\nother routes are still encapsulated, the core of the planet for its e-radiation.\nThey can squeeze the core to increase the radiation, but it does this very gently, very\nlately.\nIf it needs to, if it, in the future, it needs to, it can.\n\n\n====== REC061.txt ======\nWhen the player gets their full body, I guess the partial body I should say.\nThey can uh...\n\n\n====== REC062.txt ======\nWhen the player gets their dotex foreign body, they can paint it.\nChoose to paint it.\nOut of the dotex, the vines, the sky, all of those are the same material.\nI suppose the sky and the vines and the dotex are different, but you know,\nthe vines and the dotex are really the same.\n\n\n====== REC063.txt ======\ndeep of the player's form is hard to see, but if they paint it, either white, blue, red,\nwhatever they want to, they may find your clothes over time.\nAnyway, they also find little critters that are overdock form, that they can also paint\nwhen they find them. They can visit all the vehicles. When you paint them, you see money\naround the world they can only do, but now they're revealed to you all the time.\nHere they come.\n\n\n====== REC064.txt ======\nLions never destroy, they will destruct, and they will encapsulate or surround.\nNavigate lions.\nSometimes they'll like to play as bad.\nI don't know how to go playing yet, but we'll find a way to play mechanically.\nThat's what seems.\n\n\n====== REC065.txt ======\nSo the people, the people who had to redirect the lines, fucking hell.\n\n\n====== REC066.txt ======\nThe people are redirectivines. These significant sources of light to draw their attention, but it's a slow process to move them from their current point.\nAnd sometimes the only notice when they wake up next morning, so it's... they grow quite a bit overnight.\nWhich is what the player does. The player grows a lot overnight. They get into parts sometimes. On occasion I land them.\nOkay, now I've got hands. Now I've got feet. I've got legs. You know, a little bit little.\nGo find the robotic parts you've fallen off. This keeps the scope reduced that way to do animation.\nThey just wake up after a dream sequence. Dream sequence has relevant to the day, like the other wilds.\n\n\n====== REC067.txt ======\nThe Dodex takes him oxygen and converts him to CO2.\nThey use water energy and they use sun energy.\nAll platforms, sun energy is...\nThey're a person out.\n\n\n====== REC068.txt ======\n\n\n====== REC069.txt ======\nSo that takes it.\nDon't, don't, oh my god.\n\n\n====== REC070.txt ======\nIt takes in heat energy and light energy and converts it into electricity.\nLet's do this. Find hypothetical, theoretical, theoretical, nice relation and electromagnetic and magnetism.\n\n\n====== REC071.txt ======\nThe material uses foldable tape and energy conversion.\n\n\n====== REC072.txt ======\nOkay, so the player using the Dodec can extend energy out to the forest material and have it be malleable.\nBut, the first two on its own can't do this to itself. It needs an electromagnetic system, an external system to make it convert the hydrogen energy, great hydroatricity.\nAnd, yeah, hydroatricity. It doesn't use solar as a sound. But anyway, it converts that.\nAnd, it emits heat, but that heat isn't external. It's hot to touch. It's cold to touch.\nYeah, hydroatricity.\n\n\n====== REC073.txt ======\nto be called expectation.\n\n\n====== REC074.txt ======\nDisappointing be called.\nNot, not.\nCan't get right right there.\nShame?\nNot shame, but there.\nThe dot-x symbol for it.\nSinking feeling.\nYeah!\nAnticipated?\nIs it an anticipated nominal?\nUnexpected?\nIs that nominal too?\nWhat if it counters your expectations?\nIt's a voucher.\n\n\n====== REC075.txt ======\nRelief has happiness or sadness.\nElation, joy.\nUnexpectation.\nRelief.\n\n\n====== REC076.txt ======\nRelief would be in between have this asandas, that is asandas are the right terms. Disappointment and\nI wouldn't say surprise.\n\n\n====== REC077.txt ======\nWhat is confusion?\nCan surprise be parsed here?\nWith the system without naming it as a thing in and of itself?\nSurprised into the patient?\nMaybe.\n\n\n====== REC078.txt ======\nA personable story that you think someone might find philosophy or ideas or humor in or just\nyou want a reaction from a vaginal story you can tell.\nI've been trying to feel better about myself in that whole life change, especially recently,\nyou know, trying to love myself more regularly. It's not that I don't love myself.\nBut I don't show myself. It's not that I don't. It's more of like, I wasn't happy with a lot of\nstuff in my life, you know, like, for instance, like I don't like how certain parts of me look or\nfeel, and I know a lot of that's going to do with, like, because I'm always feeling sick, you know,\nbecause I've got that blood disease that causes my white blood cells to attack my body,\nlike my lungs. Is this a sickle song? Or a poem that I was, there's another word for it,\nbut it's a type of blood cell disease, white blood cell disease. It's not AIDS though,\neveryone always assumes that it's AIDS. Yeah, because that's, that's because there are a lot of\nactually quite a few bloodborne diseases and then I put a very few of them actually.\nI can't pronounce it, but I can look it up. Mine starts with a G, I believe, but there's a similar one\nthat starts with a few. It's not like, it's a, it's a, it's a German or English word,\nfrom like, brain, send it a really weird way or something, or let it. But, we're still,\nsorry, we're in trouble. What is it?\nYeah, it starts with a G, I could probably look it up.\nOh, this is making me think, I can't stop it, okay.\nYeah, it's, it's getting high.\nThat's you can't talk to them. That's what I'm trying to do.\nOkay, so, we do, but, um, you know, the only way to help it is if I stay healthy, right?\nI think the lady said, I'm not, not even necessarily your body's\nYeah, well, it's more of like, I also just have to take better care of myself, and I haven't\nbeen doing that as well as I would. What could you do better to take care of yourself? What could you?\nWell, you know how like, I like to cook a lot of greasy foods because it tastes really good.\nI shouldn't be doing that, but I can cook less greasy or ways. It's just a lot of the food tends\nto come out greasy because it's got heavy sauces, but lately, I've been trying to cook better\nfoods like more vegetables like you were saying. I'm doing a mini keto stay with not sticking to\nthe whole entire keto diet. Oh, it doesn't work that way. No, I know. That's not work that way.\nI told you, my dad wants to, oh, are you probably going on to it? Yeah, I'm trying to\nslowly switch things in the house to it, so where my dad starts going like, oh, this is more\nstuff she likes, and then he'll buy it in bulk. So I'm kind of like trying to manipulate\nmy dad's thoughts without telling me what I'm doing. So he'll be more inclined to, you know,\ngetting more protein in vegetables in the house versus like sugar and wheat and bread.\nBecause he buys a lot of everything, you know, like, starch is potatoes. We're heavily\nlive off potatoes, rice, because it's like poor men for you always just to have that in stock\nbecause it lasts a long time, you know. It's kind of like my dad's survival kit.\nI think it's just because my feet is like right in the way. Are you in the pan? So take your foot,\nput it up here. Right there.\nOh yeah, there's some visible light in here.\nOh, it's a little bit.\nPut your feet up here. All right, I'll turn it off for now. We'll let it cool down.\nBut then when it's ready again, just like\nLike\nCan I get rid of this thing hiding in the back?\nI'll show you later.\n\n\n====== REC079.txt ======\nThis was the whole topic, right?\nThe topic was, as you express,\nyou don't love yourself or you'd...\nI don't feel happy with myself.\nYou don't.\nHmm.\nSo, if you were to express that idea, again, that philosophy,\nthat principle or that perspective,\nhow would you say it?\nLike, so I want to build my, like, being happier with myself,\nso I'm trying different things,\ndoing more things I actually love,\nenjoying doing, and fighting the time to do it,\nas well as, like, you know, eating better,\nbecause right now I've been doing really good\nto where I've got lots of energy.\nI just have to start trying to do the effort\nto work out, to make the muscle, you know,\nslim up and stop feeling so heavy,\nso the energy I have isn't this person\nto try and keep up with.\nMy body feeling tired.\nBecause I, mentally, I feel a lot more energetic.\nLike, I just want to go do things now.\nI want to go out more and, like, feeling internally\nand feeling really better, and mentally.\nI just want to actually physically feel that as well.\nAnd I feel like, once I start getting all that together,\nI'll be a lot more happier with myself,\nbecause a lot of the time I don't,\nI've actually never really focused on myself\nand what I want, so I'm trying to do that more.\nAnd it's been making me very happy,\nlike my drawings, and my sculpting.\nMaybe swimming, but it's cold.\nIt's cold.\nI want to do more of those kind of things.\nLike, I lost 10 pounds, and then I gained it back,\nand then I started the new diet,\nand I'm slowly losing weight, but I'm not losing it.\nThat's fast as I first lost the 10 pounds.\nSo, because I bloated back up while losing,\ntrying to lose weight, I'm more healthy or with it.\nBecause I'm eating more vegetables and stuff,\nbut it's also without me doing it.\nI mean, hmm, going up.\nCan I ask a question now?\nYeah.\n\n\n====== REC080.txt ======\nSo you're not going into the ketosis diet, going into the state of ketosis, I should say.\nIt's preventable by you either out of habit or out of what you call it, habit or behavior.\nMindset.\nMindset?\nperspective.\nDo you think the mindset can change?\nI believe if you want something enough mentally, like you want the change, you have to really\nwant it internally to want anything to have a different outcome.\nBecause you can sit there and say you want change with your life all you want, but if\nyou don't act upon it, because you mentally don't really want to do the things that it\ntakes to get that change, you're not going to do the change.\nI feel like you really have to mentally believe you want things to be different and really\nwant it to change to make it change.\nBecause I've always been around myself included, people like me who say we want the change,\nwe say we want things to be different, but if we really, really actually mentally don't\nwant to do it, we're not going to do it.\nBut if we sit there and really reflect on it and start acting upon what we want to\nchange, then it changes.\nAt least that's why it's fun for me, because you can sit there and say all you want, and\nif you don't do it though, it's not going to happen.\nSo you have to mentally really want the change.\nIsn't it to say you don't want the change?\nI do and I don't, because I like who I am in a way.\nI don't care what you look, I am in a way, I am in a way, I am in a way, I am in a way, I am in a way, I am in a way, I am in a way, I am in a way.\nYou know, you never really bother me, you're not that bad.\nI don't like their words.\nThey're very active, they just do kids.\nThey're like dragging around a chain and ball before, or whatever they do.\nThey're good at keeping their kids, you know, out of my level, out of my level.\nYeah, that's usually what happens.\nThey try to turn around.\nWhatever we like, that's not what my apartment complex would have always be like.\nYou know, Dylan.\nYou know what?\nYou said an issue with that?\nI looked at it on the bottom.\nIt was like a stalker and I couldn't jump around.\nI can't jump or smell it.\nPlay.\nIt's very loud again.\nPlay.\nI stopped around.\nThere's benefits and downsides to both top and bottom apartments.\nThat's why I like the house and townhouse side,\nbecause then you have both top and bottom, without bugging anyone,\nyou only have to worry about the sides.\nYou don't want to be being in the malls or anything.\nYou know, trying to eat those stuff.\nIt's only downside.\nBeing on the bottom, you get to run around and do more things.\nYou can't do it when you're on the top.\nBecause if you do, you don't have to worry.\nI hate my duct tape.\nThat's true.\nYou can't fuck us lightly.\nYou don't have to worry about, like, you can see more of, like, the landscape.\nSo it looks nicer.\nBut you don't have to worry about issues that people don't worry about, too.\nAs much as this people will never want to have to worry about, you know.\nLike, sure, you have to be a little more quieter.\nYou're more mindful of people living underneath you.\nLike, you can't just go stuff around.\nWe can't have a bad day.\nWe're being too lazy with the friends.\nWe've got a lot more ways to be a little more quieter.\nI think it teaches a little more respect about you, too, in ways.\nBecause when I was growing up, being on the top floor,\nyou wouldn't find more quieter activities that are equally as fun,\nbut it's not as, like, crap out there.\nI do think it should be, do you think we should really get that bad?\nI think that both floors should have a moderate artist base,\nnot to dampen sound.\nThey should.\nThat would be ideal.\nBetter designate.\nIt would be a lot better design.\nSome people can just live without having to.\nWe idolise a lot more of the people around you.\nMaybe not idolise, but it might.\nThey can enjoy themselves up thinking about others.\nYeah.\nThey're not to say that.\nBecause they don't actively want to disturb others.\nIt's just the fact that they want to control themselves\nand they inadvertently disturb others.\nYeah.\nIt's not funny.\nMalintent.\nIt's like, oh, shit.\nIt's usually their greatness about it.\nI feel like I tried the same thing.\nThere was this all the time where something stopped about me.\nBecause I think aloud, because it was something about having a friend,\nand then I was like, oh shit.\nI turn it down.\nI feel bad.\nYeah.\nBut it's all just there.\nThere's something.\nThere's something down there.\nIt's too loud.\nWell, relative to time period, because you know,\nunless you look-spect.\nThis is an interesting kind of.\nOkay.\nSo, you must be look-spect.\nIt's the working days.\nSo, it's safe tonight.\nYeah.\nI am.\nThe night time there.\nYeah.\nUnless it's not as active,\nbut they're simply active until they sleep.\nYeah.\nSo, just period where it's like tight.\nEveryone should be awake.\nYeah.\nJust period where one side gets disturbed, but it's just dirt.\nYou know.\nIs that okay?\nI think it's going to be here.\nIt's going to be right out of me.\nYou're right.\nIt just starts to hit my legs faster.\nIt feels good, though.\nJust really hot.\nCorrect, please.\nIt's like standing in front of the fire.\nIt's kind of nice.\nFucking hell.\nAnd you're using less of the-\nSo, I'm-\nI'm doing an upstairs.\nI'm doing an upstairs.\nI'm doing an upstairs.\nI'm doing an upstairs.\nI'm doing an upstairs.\nI'm doing an upstairs.\nI'm doing an upstairs.\nI'm doing an upstairs.\nI'm doing an upstairs.\nAnd I don't really know what your time is, but I'm not a disrespect for, like, you know,\nThey don't know what you're shooting for.\nThey don't know what you're shooting for.\nAnytime.\nAnytime.\nAnytime, like, it could be anytime.\nLike, my mind goes everywhere.\nSo, anytime my music's too loud or whatever, just coming off on the door and I'll turn it down for a while.\nNo, you guys are great.\nDon't worry about it.\nI just like-\nIt's the same thing to us.\nIf I'm ever too loud, let me know.\nI love my music.\nWe'll talk about music.\nI don't care.\nYeah.\nJust make sure that I check my kids too, like stomping and stuff.\nOne of my-\nI have five kids.\nSo.\nAnd my

she's the person just in the same way we are.\nIt was just a little weird, but she's sentient.\nShe's an AI.\nShe used something to be revered in the same way we are.\nSo if they had to push a step further, there was AEI would have become sentient.\nThey would have had bodies of their own.\nBut instead they stepped away and left them to be there.\nI mean, I love the idea behind the movie.\nAI aren't to be feared.\nThey're to be embraced.\nThey're just another...\nYeah.\nAnd I think they're capable of being...\nNo, that idea, I love it.\nIt was just weird seeing it without a physical entity being there.\nSo this is going to trip you on.\nBut if you've heard of...\nI don't remember the name, but you know what a cephalon is in a human body or as described.\nThe cephalon is the head down to the central nervous system.\nAnd you're taking this cephalon in your...\nYou're storing it and reserving it before it dies.\nSo before the cellular senescence is the brain, before it dies,\nreally you take the cephalon from the human after they've...\nAfter the person after they've perished or they've pronounced it by society.\nAnd there's actually this...\nHmm.\nOkay, so to reticulate...\nIt's...\nOkay, you know what cell death is, right?\nCell kind of just...\nIt dies because of lack of oxygen, it falls apart.\nSo...\nAnother variable is coarse, but you take that cell.\nAnd you extrapolate that knowledge of neurons and neurons too, they dissipate.\nAfter the cell death, that's it.\nBut you can freeze them.\nBut if you freeze them, liquid, nice, hardens and expands.\nSo you're breaking the cell, you're damaging the cell destroying the neuron.\nSo we can't do that.\nSo instead of we're taking this anti-freeze liquid,\nand you flush the veins with it.\nSo it keeps it cold, but doesn't let the brain freeze.\nSo it's like...\nIf it's 90 Celsius, you're keeping like...\n72, maybe 80, maybe...\nNo extreme, it's maybe like the 95.\nYou know, you're...\nIf it's Celsius, you know, it's like your...\nBut you're preserving the brain before cell death,\nwhich means hypothetically, you could reconnect it or give it new neurons\nand give it a control of the

intense.\nPeople who go through this, but I think they'll...\nI then hopefully have a better means to engage the brain in learning in that way.\nSo it doesn't have to be as pessimistic as you think it is.\nYeah, we have time to learn, we have time to explore.\nSo I think I would...\nIf I were to die, I am a donor, but I would also be a neuro.\nHopefully, if I save up for this, it's like

So imagine.\n\n\n====== REC099.txt ======\nSo imagine you have your hands, no no, yeah, okay, imagine you have your hands, you have control on your hands.\nAnd there, you know, no controller works typically, people with it, and looks at it.\nWell, you think that, but I think it's surprising, but most people don't know how.\nThey don't have the foundational knowledge to use controller. It's a bad game design.\nSomeone born away from video game consoles as they exist.\nAnd you put them in a situation and try to learn it, there's no intuition to build from.\nYou have to even portal 2 doesn't have basic controls for looking with the mouse. It's assumed.\nIt's connected to the analog stick.\nThat and with keyboard and mouse, it's not displayed.\nAnd I don't think it's displayed for me, maybe, on analog stick, I don't know.\nBut either way, these games are fantastic at it.\nAnyway, going back to G-Screen.\n\n\n====== REC100.txt ======\nWhere's the remote from the other guy?\nWhere'd he put it?\nOh, it doesn't matter.\nOkay, whatever.\nI'm sorry.\nI didn't think I'd just explain this otherwise.\nUh, so I imagine.\nHmm?\nOh, yeah, thank you.\nJust real quick.\n\n\n====== REC101.txt ======\nOkay, well this is one-on-one.\nI thought this was the highest we've gotten in terms of number of notes.\nAnyway, actually I've got a couple thousand already.\nLike, through all these conversations.\nNot sure if I've had conversations with other people.\nTo kind of ideate, ideate, ideate, ideate, I think Leo and I have a lot of fun next time.\nWe've got to build this.\nPlease, touch it.\n\n\n====== REC102.txt ======\nRight now, I'm working on the dialer system with Molgato, but when we're done with that, I need to focus on movement.\nAnd I think one of the best methods to work around the floating point limitations,\nkind of movement, would be to have a...\nI've got the term you can tell me once.\nYou'd have a horizon-chased turbo, kind of panoramic effect.\nAll right.\nHow are the fucking term?\nOh, that's...\nPlaypad went the fuck? That's tiny. Small map.\nWe're probably a good reference if it's difficult.\n\n\n====== REC103.txt ======\nLike an endless runner, but in preset directions, in handcrafted directions.\n\n\n====== REC104.txt ======\nOh, this is gorgeous.\n\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/11_Nov_2019_-_New_folder_(27).txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, character-design, dialogue, item, location, story, quest, mechanic, bug, fix\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.014Z",

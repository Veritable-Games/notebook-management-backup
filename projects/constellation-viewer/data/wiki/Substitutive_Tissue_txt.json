These artificial tissues aren't rejected by the immune system. \r\nWhen a human with artificial tissue is injured, and if a portion of flesh is lost, artificial tissue will replace what is missing. This tissue doesn't get replaced by natural tissue. It's light grey by default and can be colored if the individual chooses. Easy to cover up, but some choose to show their scars. \n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/Substitutive_Tissue.txt.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.073Z",

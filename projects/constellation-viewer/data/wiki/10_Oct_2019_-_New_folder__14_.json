I'm an archive this, yeah, but imagine\nmore how\nand through every execution, for every kill you make you have to execute.\nEveryone is losing blood\nwhen they get hit and they struggle to stay awake\nand we're not passing out due to loss of blood and the adrenaline prevents that or\nadrenaline keeps you going longer than usual.\nYou have to ban into wounds, you have to address the wounds to stop bleeding, try to survive.\nOkay, so then you have animations, character animations, eyes, face,\nclean word how now, imagine the need if the head were to track the direction of attacks\nand the eyes fall, the eyes are trained on the attacker and the attacks\nkind of going back and forth in animation wise. The player looks where the pointer is going.\nOr they look at your incoming attack rather.\nKind of inadvertently aiming the direction you're attacking that way instead of using\ndirectional attacks or using the eyes as a, the eyes and head movement as a directional thing.\nAnd then you have lock on targets will be necessary for this, this iteration. I don't think that I\nthink you should take from the forerunner stance on this, yours overall it seems like.\nIf you had three targets maximum and you're, I've thought of clear more than that,\nbut you need a lock on system that lets you fight up to three opponents at a time,\nwould be the ideal situation. That's when it gets most intense. Four is pretty much unmanageable.\nI suppose you could have more, imagine like every character having their own ring and you're\nkind of toggling between these rings.\nThe big point there is head animation to look at the direction of the enemy has to look in\nthe direction of your attack using their head animation and their eyes. Facial expressions\nshould be a little more intense. They wince when they're in pain. They're breathing heavy,\nthey're like losing blood, they're passing out, they're getting weaker and weaker.\nYou can still represent stamina with the blue screen that works because that's hard to convey in\ngames, same with health, you can use red. But there are other ways to convey that kind of thing,\nusing gameplay. Detailed animations and such. I think an execution should be a thing,\nso when someone is about to die and hit them, or you do a fatal lunge, a fatal attack,\nI should say, the one that will kill them, you want an execution phase, an execution phase,\ntakes a little longer than usual. Not too long, but just enough to keep the attacks visceral,\nlike that, that was a satisfying kill as it were in most games. Like in Doom, for example,\nyou're making that final blow. They say it may boost the adrenaline, but it gets you more time\nto survive before healing again. In this situation, blood would be the cap on health,\nbut you lose blood slowly or fast depending when you hit, and then adrenaline would be the soft cap\non that. You can stay alive a lot longer that way, just by boosting your adrenaline, and you can't\nget blood transfusions, so you will die eventually. Unless you're taking enough time,\nthen you can drink water, that could be the abstract thing. Anyway.\n\n\n====== REC002.txt ======\nSo another e-tail to add to that idea, just a little quick.\nSo, imagine how is it?\nImagine you're into this game and it's like, you know, for how quick rounds, right?\nMaybe like 15 minutes of your deal on an average match.\nAnd you only gain another life when they advance a position.\nOtherwise, your team is, I don't know, I guess the battles wouldn't be that intense.\nYou have reinforcement camp.\nI like battle fun.\nI like battle fun.\nI like battle fun.\nI like battle fun.\nI like battle fun.\n\n\n====== REC003.txt ======\nAnother idea, so\nAnother archived I guess, but imagine instead of having to\nrest\nbut instead of having to like\nHide and wait for cover your career test to visibly rest\nThey have to sit down on the floor. They have to lean against the wall. They have to\nVisibly rest against nom jack to recover the lost energy\nOr to get their stamina back up I suppose\nSo I was prepared again. I drank some water\nMaybe snack a little bit maybe eat some food, but I guess food would be a little too. Yeah, water is primary\n\n\n====== REC004.txt ======\nA nice thing for the ad of this game might be when your character dies, you get a close\nwith your face and zooms out like oh shit, I really fucked up, I died.\nI got dead and it kind of zooms out and then it fades back to the overall map, like\nbattlefield does.\n\n\n====== REC005.txt ======\nThank you.\n\n\n====== REC006.txt ======\na fun pastime for exploring these game worlds might be making wallpapers\nlive wallpapers and a niche that hasn't been fully embraced yet\nand I think that's ultra-wide, ultra-wide is way to go\nthat should retail is great, I wish I had a 1440p ultra-wide\narchivedia\n\n\n====== REC011.txt ======\nWhere does philosophy lie and this is in the system of justice?\nWe each philosophize the\nFair means to sentence someone is their room for the\nConfronting of these\nEstablished systems\nwithin the confines of the law\nPhilosophy should be upheld as\nImportant as\nthe\nrulings regulations evidence and all the other facets that go into making the judicial process as\nwell-intentioned as it is\nWe need to recognize that\nWithout beating around the bush\nThe ideas of free will and\nConsciousness are\nNominal ideas by which that I mean their ideas that\nAre withheld in the social context but have no\nDemonstrable grounding in our\nBehavior\nWe have no\nExposite control of our actions\nWe feel that we do\nBut the actions are tied to\nThe chemical process of the brain\nAtomic processes of those molecules the\nnerves and neurons that\nOur spread throughout our body\nWe are deterministic beings. We are\nDrived from deterministic processes. Therefore we must\nRecognize that the judicial system\nIs flawed if no one believes themselves to be evil if no one acts with male intent in mind\nThen the only ones that are set aside are the ones that are affected in mind\n\n\n====== REC013.txt ======\nSo I'm going to come back inside and I'm going to just chop that side for a little bit longer.\nI'm going to get back inside.\nI'm going to focus on white box or tober.\nAnd I'm going to...\nPeople are more excited about gameplay.\nActual content than they are about.\nOh, concept pieces.\nIt's not real enough yet.\nSo if I throw out some actual gameplay, people might gain a little bit of intrigue.\nIn the gameplay, I mean the exploration of the map.\nWalking up and down.\nIf I can create a decent third person controller, I think.\nI might be able to work through this.\nThird person controller is...\nThat was the floor.\nThe third person controller is...\nIdeal for the situation.\nThe vertical slice is necessary to navigate using your feet and using your hands.\nIt's like...\nIf...\nRemnant.\nMatt.\nTomb Raider.\nMatt.\nDark Souls.\nI guess Dark Souls would be just a place where I remember Dark Souls.\nIt's trite, but that's how it is.\nSo Dark Souls.\nTomb Raider.\nMirror's Edge.\nOxen Free.\nNine The Woods.\nHmm, what a spoiler.\nThe quiet moments you find in life is strange.\nI should probably list the aspects.\nThe exploration and wonder of the world of Nira-Tamata.\nYou know that kind of thing.\nI'll keep you on on that.\n\n\n====== REC016.txt ======\nAlthough there's non-cliutopia, it's not even worth glancing at.\n\n\n====== REC018.txt ======\nProgress is the realization of utopias.\n\n\n====== REC019.txt ======\nCrazy weirdo deer, crazy deer here for the Archive I guess.\nSo imagine, right now, I have a peen bag and it's laid up against the wall and I've got\na towel beneath the peen bag and I'm blanked above me, I've got it here at the base of my feet.\nIt's not under the blanket, but it's kind of keeping me warm outside this late at night.\nIt's not good in the night, it's it's actually, it's late for me, but it's really for\neveryone else, I am worth a night shift.\n\n\n====== REC021.txt ======\nI don't like alcohol.\nAnd shit.\nOh no, beer's good.\nBut I don't like getting more of a drunk.\nBecause that's just... it's a depressant.\nI think more people like being...\nOptimistic, I would speak.\nI think I should be the norm.\nAnd depression, present.\nShould be the... secondary.\nBeing depressed is...\nIf we're removing entirely humans with a missing aspect of our being.\nBut...\nIt's... that said, it's not entirely bad.\nIt's not entirely good.\nIt's a range of experiences.\nSometimes it's...\nMore...\nMost times than the monocity.\nIt's a more extreme.\nOne that does happen.\nIt's a more extreme.\nI don't think everyone in experience is...\nlong-term depression.\nIt really does depend on their...\ncontentedness when...\nwith the...\nwith the current...\nstate of society.\nIf that makes sense.\n\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/10_Oct_2019_-_New_folder_(14).txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, character-design, gameplay\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:36.997Z",

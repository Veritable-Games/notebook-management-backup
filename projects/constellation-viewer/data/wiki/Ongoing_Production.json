[...] \n[writen orginally in 2019; returned to with attempt at clarity in 2023]\n\nLong-ago regarding the Indiepocalypse (aka, the abundant; thriving but potentialy neglected indie game area. Of ideas to review numbers counting so much for a game’s recognition. How tags give you ideas on what a game is but may not say exactingly on what a thing may be. This thing of categories and ratings are not good enough to bring recognition to those games that may find good popularity to more souls. [...] Steam’s categorizing systems and recommendation algorithms aren’t enough to help indie developers. How GoG could provide a thoughtful alternative to this. \n\t* Chris Corella/Fredrik Strøm [2019] [Chris in 2023]\n\nSee that I recognize the beginning \nof this document goes to redundancy; \nthe Steam tags are the-best for good\nutility in relation to the review sys-\ntem. Categories go a long way to see\nthat we have best-recognition of a\ntype of game. \n\nMy [so-far-believed] supposition of \nthis old document was that Valve \nmay yet see another way they may \nsee that ‘good games’ don’t come \nfrom categories or tags, but they \nfind interest better for what a thing\nreally is. How does one find a game\nthey may love; see it, but overlook it.\nHow do you see that people may be\ngiven more affordances to find given\nvalue in a game they may not see in\ndirect comparison to ‘tag’ or the strict\nthing of ‘review-abundance’ as the\nsteam rating system goes. \n\nI think I may already see a solution\nbut I will continue my way through\nthe doc to see further reason in this\nlarger idea. Remove any greater bits\nof redundancy to ‘my voice’ in saying\nmore than I had language ability to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 1 of 5: \nOn these things of necessitated categories, tags; heirarchy in way of reviews\nHow Valve sorts out what may be-best recognized to us. Of introductions to\nnew categories and the issues presented with ‘comfortable’ types in people.\n\n“I read once that people will hold themselves to the same genres”; \n\nDelination goes on and these strict separations set us to easy recognition of variations; categories, as gamesgo on to development. Iteration can be done in long-standing tiles; but really better exists in how we re-create those same things that inspired us. Games go from our experience in all ways and this thing of intuition to controls and our variegated expectations of systems speaks to our may be historied relation to them. \n\n- games I like are often derived from X, and it often fits X category very well\n- games may see-so well that they fit to X-category; can appeals to this genre Y\n\n- games change a lot; categories and tags are not useful enough to all’s attention\n- categories as tags are not good enough. [I see this is more a though exercise\nnow it seems reviews are very-much the best thing to compliment the ‘tag’ categories] \n\nGames are iterative; build on eachother implicitly, the more likely it is to misrepresent the 'modern games' in that same category. The moment a category is widely defined by an indie game, a lot of developers learn a grow from it, but almost all of them deviate in some, small, and almost imperceptible way --- \n\nin an effort to stand out among their influences. If the *toneal generation spreads quickly enough, and a branch evolves and grows long enough, the harder it becomes to categorize this new 'modern' game that still adhere’s to the game that once influenced it. \n\nIf the song is successful, and spreads widely enough, this short period of the genre's popularity will define a new genre. But that doesn't always happen.\nI have a potential solution in mind. That will involve the use of algorithms and at best, make use of machine learning  -- not widely understood and poorly defined genres. Because again, people are bad at categorizing things. We don't do it often enough to communicate genres accurately across the wide web of variants that inspire it over short periods of time.\nLet's say...if you were to define each of these hypothetical categories, in a way that's similar to how strains of bacteria are mapped in their respective evolutionary tree. Not only could it map how specific games influenced others, but you could define the *toneal generation.\n*Toneal -- derived from the word 'tone', which means \"the respective feel of a particular song\" -- In the context of 'generation', it refers to a brief moment in music's history. In games, this word could be used in terms of mechanics or an overall game’s design.\ntl;dr: We don't categorize songs often enough or quickly enough, to define every one of its *toneal generations. In the context of the oversaturated indie games marketplace (particularly Steam with its tags), this translates to the need for better definition of mechanics/gameplay.\n\nPart 2 of 5:\n\nWe're good at visualizing, well, visual things. This is why YouTube's algorithm is more effective at categorizing and suggesting than Spotify or Steam. Hear me out…\n\nA lot of us Listen to music on Spotify/iTunes. This may sound a bit unrelated, but music is quick to consume relative to the content on YouTube. It's fast -- and songs that aren't popular past a certain threshold don't take the time to engage beyond a few words. Hence why most songs aren’t carefully categorized like a colleague musician or dedicated fan might be able to; but we categorize them often enough to where the 'majority' of songs still fit the vague genre for a limited period of time. -- Videos, however. Can be relatable, directly tailored to your interests, and tied to the detailed, well-defined categories YouTube's algorithm takes into consideration.\nWe're great at categorizing videos, because that's easy for the visual people. We're OK, at categorizing music because the medium is evolves quickly and it’s easy to discern clear *toneal differences of the pieces that inspired it and a new piece in the vague genre two years from that point in time. -- And we're terrible at categorizing games because mechanics are appearing, reforming, and influencing games faster than we're able to categorize them -- so it’s harder to widely define them unless a particular game inspires many others. \nWhat if GoG could produce specifically a tailored machine-learning algorithm that slowly learns to play and categorize every game in the same way a scientist might define a strain of bacteria, but in real-time. You don't search categories. You look for 'strains' or rather, games that were influenced by a particular title you enjoyed. It'd be great for finding, well -- recommendations for games that are similar in design, and influence, not strictly the genre people loosely define them by. Note, the divergence of the rouge-like or ‘rouge-lite’ categories and imagine that division happening at a much quicker scale behind the scenes as games deviate and learn from one another -- exploring new mechanics and ideas.\ntl;dr: Akin to a generation in evolutionary biology. We could use this algorithm to better articulate how games differ from one another with precise, computer defined categories that only make sense to the AI, but help us find ‘similar games’ more accurately. Boosting the findability of indie titles without drowning them in the ocean of titles using the same tags, but may have nothing in common with them. People more into data and game’s history could potentially watch how a game’s influences spread, what’s working to garner interest, and what’s not, or how far these influences go? It’s like taking a glimpse at video game’s toneal evolutionary tree.\n\nPart 3 of 5: [disregarded, at present]\nThe largest PC marketplace on Earth is deeply [integrative] \nand the community needs trustworthy competition.\nMany indie games become hits without any definite reason, and more often than not, their respective success can feel random or seem based entirely on luck. This isn’t entirely the case, but without the proper *toneally-focused algorithms, their success will always be hard to discern.\nWhen indie games do well, their success often speaks more to the developer’s ability to defy market conventions and push millions of units overnight, than it does to how well the game was made. While large, ambitious games sell millions of units by standing out -- small, but carefully games have the potentially to sell millions of units with the right discovery system. If a game store successfully designed such a system, they could help grow the middle market. Helping small, but wonderful indie games be successful without having to redefine the market.\nIt’s so often all or nothing, and this could change that.\nThe idea here is to retain the standard revenue share you have in place, but promote/help indie games/developers with a well-refined, more precise system of curation. \n\nPart 4 of 5: Better selling those indie gems. \n\nExamples of games that sold better when they got noticed later on, than when they did in periods of relative obscurity. \nWhere critical success is unexpected for games that don’t stand out, but happens through a chance of publicity, Great games have a chance. But that happens to a handful of games. GoG could change that. Here’s a list of games that saw that aforementioned boost unexpectedly.\n\t* Title: The game started as X and became Y after Z garnered them attention.\n\nPart 5 of 5: Additional systems to support indie devs. \nHow devs may benefit from a service like Patreon built into a given platform-\nWe love to explore the detailed, immersive worlds that people make; but most of these stories don’t get a chance to expand beyond initial release. Those that do, often find additional income in slashing the price of their game over time or publishing a sequel. A problem with this method is that, in the developer’s effort to make their sequel feel fresh or distinguished enough from the original to warrant purchase, some of these sequels may end up alienating fans, and and they won’t necessarily make more income than the original did. An alternative to this is periodically increasing the sale amount. This can help a company make additional income, but they might not make enough of it later on to enable further content development. \nThis issue could potentially be mitigated by leaving the gameplay or world open-ended enough to add more side quests or bits of gameplay-related updates that maintain a player’s interest by adding further depth. But then these developers would still need a means to make consistent and reliable income to add further content. Sales only work for so long, and sequels aren’t a guaranteed success. How else could they go about supporting themselves?\nPatreon is one of the best platforms to support developers. But it’s for rare an indie game to find that kind of support through this service. Many people have no problem supporting Free to Play developers that work hard to expand on their game. Titles like Warframe have been around for over six years and still going strong, but by then these developers had a huge number of titles around their belt and we’re financially equipped to build an ambitious prototype. Most indie developers, on the other hand, work years to produce a single game, and a launch isn’t always enough to let them develop more content. Developers are more likely to find stability in building and releasing a whole new game instead of updating what they’ve already built.\nImagine if GoG had a service that let you pay X amount of dollars a month on a particular game to help it grow and expand. Developers could set their personal deadlines (like to Patreon’s ‘Per Creation’ or ‘Monthly’ payment options) but map out how much money they’d need per interval and how long it would take to develop using the resources at their disposal. Some ideas for light incentivization for players might be a subtle cosmetic item (like the tiny Ribbons in Warframe) or maybe access to exclusive behind the scenes development. Whatever works for the game.\ntl;dr Making a game’s base content worthwhile helps to drive initial sales, but it’s not always enough to keep making income. Deep sales and sequels aren’t guaranteed for success. We need a ‘Patreon’ dedicated for games and built into an existing platform like GoG.\n\nSummary: Great for GoG — and wonderful for indies.\nWe want to build a more accurate and precise game discovery algorithm, and establish a well-considered supplementary support system for developers that use your platform. Both of these resources will help the video game's middle-market grow by enabling the success of smaller developers. With enough resources, these systems could bolster GoG's position, and help your company earn a strong, well-deserved foothold in the PC gaming marketplace.\nTo be more specific, this tool could...\n\t* Play a role in establishing a larger middle-market for games via their success on GoG.\n\t* Help indie developers grow using patreon-like, internal systems to build their games.\n\t* Using machine learning algorithms to categorize gameplay focused variables\n\nSteam's categorizing systems and recommendation algorithms aren't enough to help indie developers. GoG could build a thoughtful alternative to this and earn a larger share of the PC market.\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/Ongoing_Production.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, item, story, quest, gameplay, mechanic\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.064Z",

Williamson. I've called myself a feminist since the 1970s. I have always been\nthroughout my career a fierce advocate of women, women's empowerment and women's leadership.\nI have also been throughout my life 100% pro choice. And yet recently there have been\nsome attacks, misrepresenting my positions that have come from certain circles and I'd\nlike to use this video to clear those up.\nIn 1973, the Supreme Court made abortion legal in the United States. I think that was\na proper decision. And I agree with former President Bill Clinton that abortions in America\nshould be safe, legal, and rare. I believe abortion is a deeply personal issue. It should\nbe decided according to the dictates of one's own conscience. Abortion is an issue of private\nnot public morality. And I believe the government has no business making or restricting that\ndecision.\nYet there has been an ongoing assault on women's rights, particularly when it comes to our\nreproductive freedoms. I have a deep concern about the chipping away of reproductive rights\nin the United States. In fact, in several states, restrictive measures such as the closing\nof abortion clinics and forced vaginal probes are currently in play. These are anathema\nto me.\nIndeed, the second decade of the 21st century has seen a sharp increase in anti-controceptive\nand anti-abortion legislation in the United States, nearly eliminating access for many.\nIn 2013 alone, 22 states adopted 70 different restrictions, including limits on medical abortions\nand bans on insurance coverage. This may be a rapidly accelerating trend.\nIn 2013, 27 of the 50 states were considered hostile to reproductive rights, more than double\nthe number in 2000, while the number of states with laws supportive of reproductive rights dropped\nfrom 17 to 13. Today, a majority of US women, 56% living states considered hostile to reproductive\nrights.\nI will passionately resist any restriction of limitation on or diminishment of our reproductive\nfreedoms granted by Roe v Wade. The women of America need champions in Congress to stand\nup for our most basic rights, and I will be that. I am proudly pro-choice when it comes\nto reproductive rights, as well as every other issue supporting women in making their lives\nall that they can be in the United States of America.\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: reference-wiki-pages/williamson-abortion-polling.txt\n- **Type**: wiki\n- **Tags**: wiki, reference-wiki-pages\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.241Z",

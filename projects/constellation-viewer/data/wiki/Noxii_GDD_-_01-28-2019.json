  "content": "# Noxii_GDD_-_01-28-2019\n\nContent-Type: text/x-zim-wiki\nWiki-Format: zim 0.6\nCreation-Date: 2025-03-10T16:17:55-07:00\n\n====== Noxii GDD - 01-28-2019 ======\nNoxii\nGame Design Document\nVeritable Games | 01/28/2019\nOverview\nElevator Pitch\nNoxii is a lethally competitive 12 player skydiving game [the hook] with earnable cosmetics, local split-\nscreen, online matches, and AI support [the kicker].\nGame Description\nYou and eleven other Noxii fight for your life in a fatal skydiving tournament; dive, dash, and bash your\ndescent to victory! Claim the solitary parachute hurtling towards the ground at terminal velocity and\nearn your way to freedom!\nDevelopment Goals\nLet players unlock cosmetics by playing the game instead of submitting to RNG slot machines.\nFun movement & combat mechanics complimented by a wonderfully gory destruction system.\nNo traditional HUD or UI systems. Use diegetic interface systems like the Dead Space series did.\nLimited, in-scope character customization for basic player expression and Noxii differentiation.\nDocument Key\nBlack Text – Core mechanics essential to developing the prototype.\nGrey Text – Secondary mechanics that are needed for the vertical-slice.\nRed Text – Mechanics that have been implemented in the current build.\nPlayer Mechanics\nControls\nMove (LS) – The left stick will let the player move on the X and Y axis.\nDive (RT) – RT will throw the player into a vertical dive and activate their boosters. If the player lets go of\nRT, their Noxii will drift into a free fall pose that slows them down and deactivates their boosters.Dash (A) – Tapping the A button while leaning the left analog stick will let the player dash in that\ndirection using the suit's boosters. If the player presses A without leaning the analog stick, they will dash\nupwards, this is great for escaping rough situations without the speed penalty of free falling.\nBash (A) – When an opponent is near, the game will ‘magnetize’ them together and the A button can\nthen be used to attack. In this context, the left analog stick can be used to determine the direction of a\nBash. If the player holds the A button, they can charge the attack and release it for a strong Bash.\nBrace (B) – Holding the B button will make the player character Brace for impact. Doing this will always\nmitigate damage and prevent Stun but it will also slow the player's Velocity.\nDeflect (B) – Tapping the B button at the right moment will let the player nullify incoming Bash attacks\nand give them a brief opening to counter-bash or let them gain some distance.\nBoost (LT) – Pressing LT will consume any Refined Fuel the player has collected. These items increase\ntheir normal booster velocity for a limited time. Up to 100 refined fuel can be held at any given time.\nOffensive Equipment (X) – Pressing X will launch any projectile pickups they player has collected. Three\nof these items can be held at any given time. Any collisions will remove one from a player’s inventory.\nDefensive Equipment (Y) – Pressing Y will activate Defensive items. Only one of these can be held at a\ntime to encourage well-timed use. Being attacked will remove them from the player’s inventory.\nSwap Equipment (LB) – Pressing LB will cycle through the available Offensive items.\nDrop Equipment (RB + RS) – Holding RB and selecting an item with the right stick, then letting go of RB\nwill drop or throw whichever item the player chooses.\nSystems\nHealth – Visually represented by diegetic HUD, health takes the form of suit damage, lost limbs, injuries\nto the player character, changes to animation, and audio cues like coarse breathing or broken gear.\nStun – Some obstacles, the Bash mechanic, and items will Stun the player. This effect reduces the overall\ncontrol of their Noxii and will slow their Velocity, but it will only incur a small damage penalty.\nRagdoll – Upon collision with an object, the player loses health and goes into ragdoll. They spin out for a\nmoment before recovering into their normal animation state.\nGore – Noxii suits have multiple damage states to visually represent their health. This can be done with\nblood, broken glass, scratches, sparks, etc. Some obstacles and weapons will tear limbs and heads off.\nDeath – If a player loses all their health, they're treated to a wonderfully violent die-o-rama animation\nthat shows them dying to whatever took the last bit of HP. Player will respawn as a spectator bot that\nhas a full range of motion in any direction, but they won’t be able to earn additional coin.\nVelocity – The imitated speed at which the player is falling. This variable doesn’t affect how quickly they\nmake it through the map, but rather, it affects the distance between Noxii. To keep the game engaging\nfor the 3 to 5 minute sessions, there is a limit to how far the player can be from world origin point.World Mover – Because of Unity’s floating point precision limitations, the player needs to remain within\nproximity to the scene’s origin point. An illusion of movement and speed is accomplished by moving the\nworld space around the player on the Y axis and increasing the player’s field of view to represent speed.\nCamera – Physically represented by a drone that can be seen by other players, the camera will increase\nits field of view when the player boosts, uses refined fuel, or when opponents are near and will shake\nwhen the player is damaged, stunned, or uses projectile weapons. The drone also has a spot light that\nwill pivot to point at the player it’s following.\nEquipment Pickups\nAll items can be acquired by hitting marked targets during the descent. The items given have different\npickup odds depending on a player's health, position, and their distance from the parachute. Most items\ntake the form of drones or physical attachments to a player’s suit that will break when depleted.\n*Drop percentages and statistical effects of equipment should be determined via playtesting.\nOffense Items\nRocket – A projectile that is thrown downward. If a Rocket hits a player, it will stun them and slow them\ndown. Rockets can be avoided with an appropriately timed Dash and they come in 1, 2, or 3s.\nMissile – A single-use tracking projectile that locks onto the player ahead of the one using it and sends\nthem into a Spiral if it hits. Missiles can be avoided with a well-timed Dash.\nSaboteur – The most powerful projectile in the game. Saboteur Missiles will target any player in first,\nsecond, or third place and will avoid all obstacles along its immediate path. They can be devastating\nwhen used and have a small counter window. And if they miss, they’ll proceed to the next target in line.\nDefense Items\nDefense items usually come in the form of drones. When activated, they’ll circle the player on the X and\nY axis for their set duration or until destroyed. They’re all visually distinct with different paint, tools, and\nbooster colors. All the drones are personified through audio design and each is visually distinguished.\nBuddy – This rare item will automatically deflect or destroy incoming projectiles. It lasts for 10 seconds\nand can defend against as many attacks as needed in that time. It looks like a tiny robot that yells and\ncheers every time it fends off attacks.\nMender – A drone with a limited healing ability. It can seal small wounds, repair the player's suit, and\ncauterize serious injuries. This item is a common drop that does not appear if player is undamaged.\nRed Mender – A special variant of the Mender drone that will actively seek out and fully heal any player\nthat needs health but will take away Offensive Equipment if they accept its help. It will appear once for\nevery player in in the level when used. Can only be purchased with a player’s earned red coin.\nWard – This drone will knock back anyone that goes near the player with a quick, but powerful burst of\ncompressed gas, stunning them momentarily and slowing their Velocity. Cannot knock back projectiles.\nSpeed ItemsRefined Fuel – An item that gives players increased boost speed when used and can obtained between\nmatches with their earned Coin. Using refined fuel for too long will overheat and stall the boosters.\nFaulty Jetpack – A recovery Item that gives a huge speed boost and invulnerability to players that are\nfalling behind. The Faulty Jetpack is automatically activated when picked up. The farther away a player is\nfrom the leader, the higher their chances of getting the item. Faulty Jetpacks can bolster a player's\nnormal bash attack, knocking them into a violent spin and potentially killing them if they hit an object.\nThese items are also rigged to explode after they reach a certain position in the race or used for X\namount of time. Timer is represented by a beeping noise. Player needs to throw the backpack to get rid\nof it before it explodes, or they incur a death penalty. Jetpacks can be thrown to stun opponents, and if\ntimed right, kill them. It's this same system that can be used to forfeit a parachute.\nLevel Design\nLevels\nCapital – Largest city on the planet; incredibly dense, and difficult to navigate due to traffic.\nFactory – This is where the Capital's military Droids are manufactured. Very dangerous.\nGarden – Sparsely planted agriculture for a struggling civilization. Largest map in the game.\nRemnant – An abandoned city mostly devoid of life; extremely hazardous, average depth.\nLevel Objects\nParachute – A rocket propelled parachute is launched at the beginning of every match. Whichever Noxii\nreaches it first will survive the fall. – Everyone else will hit the ground at max velocity. The parachute will\ntry to maintain a consistent distance from the players until they’re nearing the end of a level. Parachutes\nalso have a hidden mechanic. If the player brings up the Drop menu before reaching the finish line, the\nparachute will be available, and they can throw it to someone else. This is how they can earn Red Coin.\nAir Current – When the player passes over this object’s small area of influence, they’ll get a slight boost\nin speed unless they’re interrupted by an item, obstacle, or another player. The speed gained can stack\nwith multiple currents but will fall off when the player is no longer in contact with the item.\nDeadly Fan – Exactly what it sounds like. A fan that drags the player towards it when they get close. It\nwill rip off a limb if they touch it and then break. Fan radius is represented by a volumetric spot light.\nShock Barrier – A transparent cylinder in the middle of each map that fades in whenever the player gets\nnear it. It’ll shock and Stun the player if they touch it; knocking them back towards the map’s center. In\npractice, this barrier not only keeps level design manageable for areas that look huge, but also allows for\na visual spectacle far from the player’s reach to help make each level aesthetically distinct.\nGrabber – Arm-like machines that will snatch up a player mid-drop and redirect their them; often\nrevealing new paths and sometimes right into obstacles or hazards.Nav Drone – Drone that will hover into a player's sight when the controller’s ‘view’ button is pressed. It\ndisplays each competitor’s position and status. It also offers a basic glimpse at the player’s score. The\nnav drone will hover away after a few seconds and can be destroyed by environmental hazards.\nStatus Drone – Small drone that can dart in and out of the player’s view quickly. It’ll display things like\nMID-DROP or MAX VELOCITY. This drone is also remarkably skilled at dodging obstacles and projectiles.\nLocations\nHUB Area – This is where players can upgrade equipment, buy Refined Fuel, talk to NPCs or players, and\nselect the next level. It’s all done in third person from a fixed, wide camera angle.\nDropship – Every participant in the match starts from the Dropship. It hovers above the chasm below\nand launches the booster propelled parachute seconds before everyone dives after it.\nStadium – This is the post-match landing zone for victors and a violent impact point for those that failed.\nHere, the scoreboard is shown, earned Coin is added up, and the crowd cheers with excitement.\nAnnouncer\nDeath Dive games are hosted by an announcer. He'll appear on a hovering display similar in design to\nthe Nav Drone and he is the only character that reveals their face. He has a slightly-off color nose and\nfingers that are shown to be prosthetics; the consequences of untreated deep frostbite.\nMedia Drone – A drone that follows the player outside of the play-space and broadcasts live recordings\nof the event, announcer reactions, and even gives obstacle hints. Media Drones can also be controlled\nby dead players or spectators.\nMatch End – Just as the music is at its peak and the players near the finish line everything stops, it cuts\nto black. The camera transitions to ground level and all the losers hit the ground one by one until there’s\na brief pause, and the winner gently drifts to the ground in their parachute. Scores and Coin are tallied\nhere but the whole process can be skipped if the player so desires.\nRendering\nLevels are separated by various types of entrances that serve as loading areas to keep the performance\nin check and rendering cost low. Doors, smaller tunnels, large obstacles, etc.\nUnlock Systems\nRewards\nCoin [¢] – A Noxii's reward for participating in the deadly competition. It can be traded for cosmetics,\nmodifications that affect their maximum velocity or defense, and at a high cost, freedom.\nAcclaims – Bonuses for performing certain actions during a match. The end-game screen will display\ntotal earnings, how they were obtained, and then add them to the player's total Coin.\n- Champion: 1500¢ - Reached the finish line and survived the landing.- Challenger: 500¢ - Made it to the finish line but didn't survive the landing.\n- Contestant: 150¢ - Died during the match and didn't make it to the finish alive\n- Executioner: 50¢ - Killed a player or AI during a match, this stacks up to 11 for 550c\n- Operator: 25¢ - Used equipment, this can be done as many times as available on a map.\n- Attacker: 5¢ - Damaged an enemy by any means, this can be stacked ad infinitum.\nRed Coin – Noxii are usually only rewarded for being aggressive and competitive. So, if a player were to\nforfeit the option to attack when given the chance, they don't earn any coin for it at the end of a match.\nHowever, if this happens, a hidden current dubbed ‘Red Coin’ is granted to them without any sort of\nexplanation. Narratively, this is the currency of a separatist faction and it can be used to buy additional\nparachutes for a single red coin each or a consumable Red Mender drone for 50¢.\n- Rebel: 100r - Gave your hard earned parachute to someone else at the end of the match.\n- Revolutionary: 25r - Healed a player with a Red Mender during a match, can be stacked ad infinitum.\nCosmetics\nPlayers can obtain cosmetics with Coin by playing the game and earning Acclaims. Each of the items is\navailable for purchase as soon as the player has enough Coin to buy them. Prices will range from 500¢ to\n10,000. Item categories include Head, Torso, Arms, Legs. Colors can only be purchased with Red Coin.\nUpgrades\nIn the HUB Area, players can purchase suit upgrades with earned Coin. Every item has a positive statistic\nimpact and a negative one. i.e. Quicker stun recovery time but slower velocity gain. Each of these items\nare mechanical replacements of human body parts. Some can only be equipped if the player decides to\nmake that transition. “This will replace your natural X” These changes are irreversible once made.\nOther Details\nMultiplayer\nNoxii supports up to 12 players online, 4 player local split-screen, and up to 11 AI that fill the roles of any\nmissing players. There might be a way to pull of 8 player local-co-op with some changes to UI/gameplay.\nObscure Details\nWeapons, abilities, equipment, and HUD/UI elements are all represented by physical items in the game\nworld. This makes the experience feel grounded in the same way that Dead Space does.\nIf an offensive drone gets a kill have them cheer, beep, or whirr to communicate that fact to the player.\nThis is especially helpful if the kill happens off-screen with tracking missiles or something similar.\nDuring a match AI have the same tools and abilities as the player character. They only really vary in their\nvisual and audio design. But slight tweaks to normal variables could help distinguish them better.Design Questions\n•\n•\n•\n•\nHow should rewards be balanced based on item cost? Use Halo Reach for reference.\nWhat are the consequences of losing a match? Reduced coin, broken gear, medical bills?\nWhat should the target system requirements be?\nYou’ve got gamepad controls, but how should they be setup on keyboard & mouse? (Distance)\nStory Questions\n•\n•\nHow much debt does the main character have? How many missions does it take to pay off?\nHow did the player accrue this much debt? What if it was a life-saving prosthetic?\nNarrative\nSetting\nThe Noxii are criminals condemned to death by the nation of Boreas; a struggling civilization on a frigid\nplanet far from humanity’s origin system. They've been offered a chance to free themselves through the\ncountry’s lethal tournaments and few are reluctant to try. Only a handful of Noxii will survive.\nThe Death Dive games take place within the immense chasms this civilization uses as habitats to insulate\nthemselves from the endless winter above them. Every subsurface city has been temporarily fitted with\nobstacles, environmental hazards, and equipment drops for participants to use. Victors will be greeted\nby an audience of millions and those that perish will be have their remains pressurized for fuel.\nThe planet Boreas is frozen, but cities are varied in design and function so level design isn't at all limited\nby that detail. Just above the atmosphere lies the remains of a ring world that looks to have crashed into\nthe planet's surface some time ago. This is a small hint towards future potential projects.\nInhabitants of this ice world will often have prosthetic fingers, noses, and toes because of the likelihood\nof frostbite. The announcer character makes this particularly apparent in his design.\nBackstory\nThe main character has fallen into severe debt due to medical bills. After several years struggling to pay\nit off, they’ve fallen on hard times. The Boreas government has sold their debt to a wealthy corporation,\nand them along with it. Now they’ve been forcibly enlisted in the deadliest games on the planet.\nPay off your debt and survive — or fall into the abyss.\nThemes\nNew technology isn’t something to be feared. Humanity’s tools are a part of who we are and saying that\nwe’re too dependent on them is thinking backwards. They are a permanent part of our species, and not\nbeing able to survive without them is a reality we should come to accept.\nWhat makes us ‘human’ shouldn’t be defined by our natural form. Someone with implants, prosthetics,\nor enhancements is no less human than anyone else. Pushed to the extreme, the cyborgs we imagine in\nscience fiction should be treated in the same way. Do away with the fear of improving our bodies.The player is celebrated by the general population for improving themselves but are shunned regularly\nby the NPCs they fight against. Upgrading makes the game less difficult, but it’s not mandatory to do so.\nStory Events\nSomeone asks the main character to wear their robotic arm if they die. They express a genuine desire to\nlive but know that they won’t survive these games. During the following match this person will save the\nplayer from incoming damage and sacrifice themselves in the process. After the match the player is\ngiven the option to accept or decline the robotic arm previously seen on this character. It’s a weak item.\nA fellow Noxii asks the player to retrieve the artificial part of his mind when he dies. He knows this isn’t\na full version of himself, but he hopes some aspect of who he was will live on. The player is given the\noption to accept or decline the component after the match. It offers no benefits.\nDevelopment Timeline\n•Prototype the project and build the core mechanics/features\n•Contract people to create assets for vertical slice (Upwork or Fiber)\n•-- Give detailed information and context about listed assets\n•Start a blog and build a community (e.g. Discord)\n•Develop a Minimum Viable Product (demo) and polish it!\n•Publicize steam store page; encourage wish listing\n•Launch a Kickstarter, detail the goals of this small game\n•-- Add the well-polished Demo to the Steam store page\n•-- If the KS is successful, build a team and add additional (but in-scope) features\n•-- If the KS is not successful, focus on the core mechanics and polish one level\n•Prepare a representative Vertical Slice and find a publisher\n•Establish Early Access as soon as the game has enough content\n•Pre-develop additional free content to give yourself breathing room at launch\n•Launch on Discord as a timed exclusive then launch on Steam, GoG, and Epic\n•If this game is successful, consider porting to console with full Cross-Platform\n•Plan development for your next major project\n•Offer support for this game for as long as we can\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: noxii-wiki-pages/Noxii_GDD_-_01-28-2019.txt\n- **Type**: wiki\n- **Tags**: wiki, noxii-wiki-pages, character-design, item, weapon, location, story, quest, feature, gameplay, mechanic, fix\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.218Z",

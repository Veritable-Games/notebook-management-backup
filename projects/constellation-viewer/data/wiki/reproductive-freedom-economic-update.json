So that's what I think is their agenda.\nSorry, Liam. Yeah, no, it's all good. So is it, is it very much of the deliberate decision about\npopulation numbers and that essentially we need more people to be the workers, be the soldiers\nand the abortion laws get in the way of that end? Yes, but I also think that it's a way of\njuicing a movement that America used to go be great. And if we re-enact the restrictions that\nwe're used to have, it will again be great if we just re-institute Jim Crow and discriminate\nagainst black people and keep women in their inferior place, then America will be great again.\nAnd they don't want a face that the American century is over. Am I right in thinking that\nRoe versus Wade had problems to begin with because it was based on not really on women's rights,\nbut more on privacy, is that correct? Yeah, I mean, the thing about, the thing about Roe is that\nit was very much a compromise with what the movement wanted. The movement wanted free abortion\non demand. So the free part becomes much more important as medical costs rise, but it was\nalways important because abortions, you know, initially costed when they were first legal in\nNew York, costed $200. So that wasn't easily available to pretty much anybody.\nNow, briefly, the Medicaid did cover abortions nationally from 1973 to 1976. And a lot of people,\na lot of people availed themselves of that 300,000 abortions a year. So a lot of people\nneeded abortions that they were getting at that point. And that was stopped under Carter.\nCarter signed the high amendment initially. It was an issue in the election. Ford\nstaked out of position against it. Carter was for it. And this basically banned any federal\nfunding for abortions. So that meant that we really had no right to abortion. We really had the\nright to go out into the private market and attempt to purchase one. Yeah. So that and you\ncan see like the contrast with Argentina, which just won legalized abortion abortion in 2020, right?\nTheir law says that within 10 days of your requesting an abortion, the health system has to\nprovide it to you. Like, you know, that's sort of the opposite of ours where you have to have\na waiting period, right? So and the movement wanted it to be five days. They didn't win that,\nbut they wanted in 10 days. So that sort of shows what an abortion right would actually look like\nif we had had won it in the US. But we never really won the right. What we won was the ability for\nthe states were basically prohibited from from putting in certain certain restrictions.\nAnd then as the Supreme Court decisions have piled up, they've allowed more and more restrictions\nto the point where there are so many restrictions in some of the states, even before the\nDOBS decision, it was very difficult for a lot of people to get abortions. And so I think when\nwe look at this, we should say, well, we don't want to go back to 2021 on abortion law. We really\nwant to go forward and make it a national right through a national health care system, a Medicare\nfor all, whatever you want to call it, where everybody has the right to all the health care they\ndid. That is really how we can get reproductive rights in reality, including contraception,\nwhich is also quite expensive. Yeah, that's very important. Because I think what you had in Argentina,\nwith where they won abortion in spite of the Pope making an in-person visit to his birthplace to try\nto get them to vote against abortion, is they had that kind of unity of indigenous movement,\nthe socialist movement, the feminist movement, the black rights movement, the climate movement,\nall supporting them. And I think in 1973, we had a de facto coalition because the riots were\nhappening starting in 1968. They also had a very unpopular war in Vietnam that people were\ndemonstrating against. And they really couldn't afford to have millions of women out there demanding\nthe right to abortion as well and being dissatisfied. So I think they felt they had to give.\nAnd I don't think they feel that now because there isn't a unity on the left,\neven de facto, the way they used to be, and the way they have been sorry.\nYeah, the other factor there is, of course, you had the entire socialist world with abortion legal\nand free in government hospitals, right? You could go and get it, including Poland, where it's\nnow completely illegal. So people could go behind the eye and curtain for freedom, right? So that\nthat was really embarrassing and just added to the pressure on the US government to do something.\nMeanwhile, we had whole wards of people with botched abortions, dying or terribly injured,\nyou know, whereas you could get a free legal abortion in hospital in Moscow.\nYeah, that's true. That competition made them give a lot more than they would have.\nAnd I think that if we are to win these rights back, we have to make a coalition of all people\nwho are deprived of their rights, which is an awful lot of people in the United States,\nincluding the climate movement being deprived of the right to live.\nBut that would have to happen on the left, the way it did in Chile and in Argentina and also in\nColombia, that from South America. Sorry, Harry, I just want to pick up on that sort of the observation\nyou made just then and in the book, this idea that there's a difference in sort of birth rate\nbetween capitalist nations and previously socialist nations and how they changed over time.\nI don't know if you could talk about that a bit because yeah.\nYeah, so what I observed is that with a couple of exceptions,\nso all the socialist countries made abortion legal shortly after they won.\nThis was Turin Vietnam, it was Turin Korea, it was Turin Cuba.\nRussia, yeah.\nYeah, so Union was the first.\nAnd so you have to ask, okay, why was that? Well, first of all, they believed in equality.\nIn the Soviet Union, certainly, there was a lot of laws passed for women to have equality.\nBut they also believed that women had contributions to make other than just as mothers, right?\nSo they tried to make it easier for people to have babies and put a lot of resources into\nmaternity care and crushes and laundries and cafeterias to get the housework out of the home\nand basically lighten the burden on people so that they could do other things, right?\nAnd in Vietnam, you also see that they had this plan, which was to lighten the burdens\non women workers so that they could do other things than just raise kids.\nAnd one of the parts of that was to give them control over reproduction.\nSo that was an ideological thing.\nBut then the other thing, and you see it in China, right?\nWhich has gone from, which went from a position of having a one-child policy to slowly\nloosening that to a two-child policy. And now, they're really actually in trying to encourage\nbirths. The one-child policy came in as part of the dump-shopping reforms in 1979.\nAnd what they, what their stated reason for it was, and by the way, it was one child,\nif you were urban, if it was two children, if you were rural, and if you were a national minority,\nyou could have three children because those were oppressed groups.\nThey brought it in because they felt that the gains that they were making from development\nwere basically getting spread out too much among this burgeoning population that they had.\nAnd they wanted to consolidate those gains of development and basically have each person\nhave more stuff, right? So that's only a situation that you can have in a socialist country where\nthey're actually sharing stuff out, right? So that was the stated reason for the policy.\nAnd as capitalism has been restored, and more and more of China has basically become capitalist,\nthey have realized that they need to feed the needs of these corporations for workers.\nAnd so that's why they have loosened these policies.\nAnd also you see this in Russia. So in the Soviet Union, abortion was made legal between\n1921 and 1936. In 1936, abortion was outlawed under Stalin's changes because they were afraid.\nYou know, here was Hitler saying he was going to annex parts of Russia.\nIn my comp, he talks about how he's going to annex parts of Russia.\nAnd they were under attack from every European country basically sent troops and the US and troops\ninto the Soviet Union tried to overthrow the government. So for military reasons, they got rid of\nthat. Then in 54, they restored it in the postwar period. They restored abortion rights.\nAnd basically had full abortion rights up until the overthrow of communism.\nNow after that, they started to work. There was an incredible drop in the birth rate because\nliving conditions got so bad when the looting of the state happened and basically the oligarchs\ntook over. And living conditions were so terrible. The death rate went up drastically and the\nbirth rate went down drastically. And so now it has become a theme of the Russian state to try\nto raise the birth rate. And every year Vladimir Putin gives speeches about how we have to raise\nthe birth rate. And they have also put enormous amounts of money into cash support for mothers.\nSo that's their preferred way of doing it. And that's raised the birth rate slightly.\nBut you can see that now they're now they're very concerned about the birth rate. Whereas during\nthe socialist period, it was not really an issue. All that postwar period, you know, it was the\nbirth rate. It was around 2.1 round replacement. Nobody was freaking out that there weren't enough\npeople. Oh, man, the factory is nobody was free. It was it was not an issue. Whereas in the US,\nwhen we have a around replacement or below replacement birth rate, or in China with capitalism\nrestored, they're very worried about that. So I think that's it now there are cases of horrible\nreproductive coercion and, you know, Romanian orphanages and all this stuff. But but for the most\npart in socialist countries, they have a much better record on the on first of all, on contraception\nand reproductive reproductive rights in general, partly because they're willing to go up against\nthe church. But but also, but also there's not this massive need to to create profit opportunities\nthrough the growth of the system in general, which has relied primarily on population growth\nsince the inception of the system. Populations have been growing. So that's I think that's an\ninteresting contrast to make and to say, okay, what is it about capitalism that it that requires us\nto have births at baby boom rates in order for the system to continue and to not stagnate? So\nthat's a question that that we should be asking. Well, I also think that right now, what's happening\nis that they have exported a lot of the good jobs overseas. And we've gone from a manufacturing\neconomy to a service economy. And women and men's wages have more have become more equal,\nnot because men's wages improved, but they stagnated. And so women now make 82% on average\nof what men make, but people are rejecting shit jobs now. 20 million people dropped out of\nthe labor force during the pandemic, because they were being exploited, underpaid, and told they\nwere essential. And the contradiction was just too much. And so I think what's happening is\nalso they kicked out the immigrants who used to wash dishes for almost nothing in an\noppressive environment. So between getting rid of the immigrants who took the shit jobs and were\nunderpaid and people refusing the shit jobs where they were underpaid and a massive unionization\nacross the United States, unlike anything that was seen before except in the 30s, they're getting\nnervous. And they want to have a lot of cheap shit labor. And these neglected unwanted children\nwith inadequate upbringings would be the dishwashers of tomorrow without allowing immigrants to come in.\nAnd the low page clickers in the grocery stores and so on. So I think they want to replenish\nthe bottom of the labor force that they don't allow in because of immigrants. And because they\nunderpaid people so terribly and told them they were essential, people are refusing.\nIn all these examples of control, historic and present, I think one of the things that\none of the stats that was really interesting in your book was that 25 to 30 percent of women are\ngoing to need abortions, whether it's legal or illegal. So these forms of social control,\nit's questionable how much they sort of quote-unquote work for their particular ends, given that\nyou know, it's very similar to the drug policy stuff when we spoke to\nthe Karl Eric Fisher, was that his name? When he was talking about when he tried ban\nsubstances, all it does is it just drives it underground. Like there's still just the same amount\nof demand for stuff. So there's a sort of lunacy to the trying to control everyone, right?\nIt's interesting because I was just reading this American Enterprise Institute report from\n2018, which is all about the declining fertility, right? So this is a railing think tank that has\nbeen promoting capitalist interest. And the report, first of all, it has empty bassinets on the front\ncover, right? So it's by this guy named Lyman Stone, and he mournfully says, well, you know,\neven really strict laws making abortion and contraception illegal are probably not going to\nraise the birth rate by more than about 5 percent. What we really need is to sort of change the\nculture. And he points to the former Soviet state of Georgia as an example, where, you know,\nthe head of the church there has said you must have children, and you know, they have all this,\nyou know, basically there's a lot of propaganda around it that, you know, your role is to have\nwhat not. So we could see some of these bands and the crackdown on contraception as, which is also\nanother aspect of this, and we're going to see more of that if the Supreme Court decision is\nany indication. But I mean, even under Trump, like half of the Title 10 family planning visits\nevaporated, like those policies really made it hard to get contraception. So when you, when you\nban contraception and abortion, it may not raise the birth rate much, but this, this sort of culture\nof disapproving of abortion, disapproving of contraception, trying to get people to think of, to\nidentify themselves somewhat as Harry was saying, you know, with, with their, their ability to produce\nchildren and the family and sort of enclosing, getting rid of, of other options for women and\nenclosing them back into the family to make that basically the only option that you have. I think\nvery much is on their agenda and they're hoping, you know, through a combination of making these\nthings illegal and disapproving of them and all this religious propaganda and all and, and other\npropaganda, this particular American Enterprise Institute guy Lyman Stone is big into a, his big\nthing is promoting marriage, how great marriage is. And this is part of his idea of like, if, if\npeople get married, then they'll have kids, which I think he's got the causation wrong at, you know,\npeople get married because they're planning on having kids. But, um, but, you know, there's definitely\na correlation and he thinks if we can just force and discriminate against women enough to make the\nfamily the, the best option for them, then maybe we can force them into raising the birth rate and\npat Buchanan, you know, former Nixon speechwriter and various, like, right wing presidential candidate\nat various points, who claims to be responsible for, for, as he says, running the sword through\nchild care under the Nixon administration. His whole thing is, you know, that we have to\ndiscriminate against women more vigorously and so that, you know, he believes that the equal pay\nwas, um, you know, a siege gun against, against the West, he talks about this, he also calls the,\nhe also calls contraception, the suicide tablet of the West, right? So, so it's very much, he's very\nmuch into this racist replacement theory, um, stuff. But, but his idea is if you bring back discrimination\nagainst women and jobs, then they will be forced back into dependence on husbands who will then\nhave power over them and then they will go, what Harry, it was saying, it forced you back into\nthe family and that is, that will be the only way that you can fulfill yourself as through having\nkids. So, uh, you know, I, I think it's part, I think the, the, uh, banning abortion and contraception\nwhile they might not immediately have, uh, effects on the birth rate, although I have to say that\nbanning contraception in, uh, in parts of Texas where, uh, in 2011, there were, there was, uh,\nmassive cuts in contraception funding and they, and there, there was a whole area where there were\nno, no clinics anymore. Birth, the births raised were, the birth rate went up 27%. So it may be that\nthey can actually force this abortion, not so effective as we can see from, for example,\nPoland, which still has one of the world's lowest birth rates despite, um, despite having banned\nabortion. But when you, when you get rid of access to contraception, that can be, I think, a little\nmore effective than even this American enterprise institute guy thought. But at the same time,\nit's, it's part of a whole plan of, of enclosing people back and forcing the expenses of, uh,\nof having kids back into the family and back onto our strained wages. That's, that's kind of the\nagenda for, um, you know, it's not just a high birth rate agenda, but it's also who's going to\npay for it in agenda and the agenda around that is that, is that any expenses have to be born\nby the family out of our paycheck. It's not going to be guaranteed. It's not going to be paid\npublicly. Yeah, one of the problems with that, though, is they've wanted to push women back into\nthe situation of the 50s without pushing back the conditions of existence of that family,\nwhich were a family wage for the white male. And so that's, they could have the fascist family,\nwhere they have women forced to work and also forced to subordinate themselves to their husbands.\nBut then they're so exhausted, they can't have children, which is what happened in Nazi Germany.\nThe birth rate didn't go up as planned because women couldn't conceive it. They were too wiped out.\nYeah, I mean, the crisis, they're, you know, they're facing this crisis on all these different levels.\nAnd they, you know, basically the idea of the family wage, which, which is sexist in the, in all\nthe ways that we just described, but at least it meant that corporations were providing some\nresources for raising a family, right? But now we are, we are completely on our own,\nwhere both parents are working. They're getting 80 or more hours a week out of a couple.\nAnd there's, there's no resources for raising the kids. There's no, the family, the family job,\nwhich used to be paid by the man's foot, you know, in the ideal, like, good union job situation,\nwhere, where the man's wage paid for the kids and for a spouse to do all the care work.\nWe don't have that anymore, right? So, so that's created the crisis within the family.\nAnd then that result, what has resulted is people are just having fewer kids. I mean, in my group,\npeople were saying, well, you know, I wanted to, but I just decided to stop at one. I can't,\nit's, it's too much. I can't do it with the time, the expense, the childcare expenses, the\nlack of reliable healthcare, no time off at work. I mean, it's just too much. So, and then many people\nare deciding not to have any kids. So that's kind of the, the, where the struggle is, is expressing\nitself is in this low birth rate, which we're calling, in my group, we call it a spontaneous birth\nstrike using, using an early 20th century term that Emma Goldman used, spontaneous birth strike\nthat, but we are all blaming ourselves. We don't see it as the political thing. And we think it's\nimportant for us to see it as a political thing and not just think of it as our own personal\nfailings to make it work. I think that's completely right. Because the biggest development\namong married people now is married people, no children. Because they're too expensive. And because\neverybody gets divorced, really it's more than 50% because 50% are formally divorced.\nBut then another 20% at least are people who have no kids and no\nvaluable possessions enough to fight over it. So they just split. So you have about 70% of people\nsplitting in a marriage. And people, women don't want to be left with the kids. And so\nthey're the ones refusing marriage now, particularly among blue collar women. That's why 42%\nof kids are born outside of a marriage. Whereas in the 50s, it was about 15%.\nIt's huge. And it's an economic issue as well as a social one. And the only way I think\nthey could pull off getting women back is to have a fascist family like they had in Nazi Germany.\nAnd even that didn't increase the birth rate because women were wiped out from all the jobs they\nhad to do. Well, I think it's really interesting as well what you're saying about this particular\nright wing think tank. And that they have to change the culture that there has to be propaganda.\nI think one of the things that came out from reading the book is just how much the\ninitial sort of women's liberation movement, their demands, how relevant\nthat the sort of seven initial demands are still. Yeah, right. And particularly the last\none was about the workers control the profits. That's another sort of rabbit hole to go down.\nBut the thing that is fascinating is like, you know, you very much outline in your book\nthings that worked and things that work in terms of changing laws in terms of pushing\nfor a society where abortion is, you know, legal and free and easy, right. And that these\ncertain things that work are just conversations being actually being able to talk to each other.\nAnd like exactly like you said, people are sort of when they're just having the one kid or whatever\nthey're just sort of seeing it as a personal failure or something opposed to sort of systemic\nlike a social issue. And on this, I think we should talk about all these things that work to push\nto sort of push back and, you know, sort of create the world you actually want to live in.\nBut sort of one of the most fascinating things is all the things that don't fit neatly\ninto the right wing's position, right. The one that blew my mind was seven out of ten\nwomen that get abortions or already mothers. Yes, yeah.\nSo that, I don't know. It sounds like both both Harriet and Equal, you knew that like maybe I'm\njust being a sort of stupid British person over here. But like, is that a known thing in America?\nOh, I think that's a very surprised. I think it's a worldwide, I mean, statistic in general\nthat it's not just an American statistic, if I recall.\nWell, I think that even Margaret Sanger, as you cited, Jenny, was a appeal to by these women\nwho had more children than they could possibly handle. I mean, the right thing here likes to say,\nlikes to sort of demonize anyone who wants an abortion. But\nand I think I make, quote, in the book this, this mom who went to get an abortion and she thought\nshe was like some terrible Medea-like person for wanting to get an abortion even though she\nalready had a kid. And then she was astonished to read that most people who had abortions in the US,\nand I guess Equal, he says worldwide, are people who have kids. So it's part of the propaganda\nthat, oh, it's just, you know, these careless teenagers or whatever that are getting abortions.\nClearly, clearly, it's all kinds of people getting abortions.\nWell, I would say that the things that worked for, that we should bring into the current situation\nin the 60s are what Harriet was talking about, this general uprising was very effective in\nwinning a lot of things because the power structure was frantically trying to peel off different\nsegments of the movement and sort of neutralize them. So, for example, we got the occupational\nsafety and health act partly because the because the Nixon administration wanted to\nappeal to workers in a way that it was losing its chance to appeal to workers.\nWe, you know, we got abortion, probably they were trying to try to get women to calm down\nand various other things. So definitely a broad left movement with all of these demands in it\nis, was one of the ways that we want. Another way we want is, and this was very clear in the\nsituation with the referendum in Ireland in 2017. So they had bumped along with a sort of a reform,\nabortion reform movement for decades and, and basically the content of it was trying to\ncreate a few exceptions to the, the ban on abortion in Ireland. And one of the things was,\nwell, would you have, would you have two shrinks sign off on the person with suicidal or could you\njust have one shrinks sign off on whether, well, all of these debates about like, well, if it was\nrape, could do, would you have to prove it was rape, blah, blah, blah. All of that, we had the same\nproblem in the US. We had a small reform movement that went along and tried to change these,\nchanged the laws with these little exceptions. But it didn't appeal to the general public because\nmost people didn't think they were going to be in that kind of a situation. Very, you know,\nand it wouldn't help most people who needed abortions. So, so it was when the women's liberation\nmovement raised the demand for free abortion on demand where people saw, oh, wow, I could get this.\nIt would be free. This is what I need. Um, that galvanized an enormous uprising on the issue. Same\nthing happened in Ireland when they went from these small demands to a demand, a group of, um,\nanarcho feminists in Dublin came up with this, this idea of, uh, free safe legal as the,\nas the demand. And we're able to lead the movement into that into talking about abortion.\nThey named their campaign the abortion rights campaign. They were told, don't use the word abortion\nthat'll turn people off. They said, no, we have to talk about what we want. And they were able to,\nand they won overwhelmingly. They were very surprised. They thought it was going to be extremely close.\nThey won by 66% of the vote, um, after a huge campaign in which they did a lot of door to door\ncanvassing. And I think this is important to getting people to talk about abortion in more than\njust this very surface sort of, um, a moralistic way and really think about the issues. And,\nand of course, think about all of the people and learn all the people in their lives that have\nhad abortions, um, that was able to happen in Ireland because of all this canvassing because it was\non the ballot. And we're going to have the opportunity to do that in various states where abortion\nis going to be on the ballot. So, for example, in Michigan, they're putting it on the ballot.\nUm, in Kentucky, there's going to be a referendum that is actually anti-abortion, but it's the same\nconversation right vote against this referendum around abortion in Michigan. So there are going to\nbe all these opportunities to really have deep conversations about what is this about. And I think\nwe also need to include like what is this about in terms of having control of our reproduction when\nreproductive working conditions are so bad. Um, but that was I think that is very effective. And I\nnoticed that when you look at the polling around abortion in the 90s, there's a big leap in support\nfor abortion rights. And the 90s were when we really went back to doing a lot of mass mobilization\naround abortion. So it's really effective. Um, and getting people to think about it in ways that\nthey had not thought about it. You think, oh, there's all this abortion rhetoric. Everybody knows\neverything they've heard everything about abortion, but it's not really true. They haven't really\nthought about it in their own sort of context. And, and it so that that's important. The other part\nthat was incredibly important was the speakouts, people talking about their legal abortions,\ngetting up women, whole panels of women saying we had legal abortions on her sister, Rose, was one\nof the first people to testify about this. So like actually talking about the illegal abortions and\nand and this contradicts everything that we hear in the current sort of liberal version of this\nwhere, oh, abortion is a very private and personal decision. It's between you and your doctor.\nYou shouldn't talk about it in public. You shouldn't be forced to testify about it. Well,\nobviously people shouldn't force to testify about it. But it's very important that we do testify\nabout it and do talk about it. And that will make it safer for other people to talk about it. And\neventually it will become just this commonplace thing, right? If if we're scared to and if we're\nshamed and to not talking about it as we are by both liberals and conservatives in this in this\nsituation, we will still end up with everybody thinking it's something shameful. It's something\nsecret or private. And instead, what we said is the personal is political. We have to make this\npublic. We have to talk about it. And I have to say shout your abortion. I have to give a lot\nof kudos to this was basically a hashed a couple of women who's testified about their abortions\nin the main game. This hashtag that went viral blew up and and thousands and thousands of women\ntestified about their abortions. And so that kind of thing we need to do more of that to give\npeople who are viewing shame the the sense that oh no, this is not something that I should have\nto keep secret. That's right. That's huge. I also think that you know, one of the things that's\nin our favor these days and that the Supreme Court is reacting against as it's progressive is\nthat religion is much less popular than it has ever been particularly among young people.\nAnd the kind of misogyny that evangelical religions espouse like the southern\nBaptist conference on men and women. And they are the largest Protestant\ndenomination says that women should be subordinate to men. Men should be protective of women.\nWomen should be subordinate. They should never be your boss or anything like that if you're a man.\nAnd yet probably because they're always caught literally with their pants down over and over again.\nJerry fall well liking to watch his wife have sex with the pool boy and investing in the pool boys\ngay club and the guy from Liberty University,\nboard of trustees who died with a dildo up his ass and a rubber suit, which didn't look good\nfor the church. Well, you know, their expose as perverts hasn't helped and their numbers are\ndwindling and so the Catholic Church is it with the expose starting in the year 2000 and increasing\nand increasing even in South America of their sexual predations against children.\nAnd I think that the the moral. This was this was very important in the Irish case because they\njust they had exposed both the sexual abuse of children and the Magdalene laundries where\nwhere and then also this horrible operation that they forced on people where they basically\nbreak your pelvis in order to allow the baby through right instead of a cesarean. So all of that\nreally dis made made the church and and they had also just won a marriage equality referendum.\nSo that gave people hope. So at very much like church, people may still, you know, have beliefs\nand religion, but they were very anti clerical at that point. So that that's a that was a very\nimportant thing. And I think that's got to it's got to have been true as well to some extent\nin Argentina. Oh, yes. Yeah. But I think also that there's a there's a great bit in your book\nfor it. There's a it's not a testimonial as such, but it was somebody talking about working\nin an abortion clinic and that they were fully aware that there were Catholics going in there\nfor abortions and that they there was this sort of ex they saw themselves as the exception to\nthe rule like that. You know, they were doing the responsible thing or something like that. And\nthat it's worse than that. The actual picketers that were picketing the clinic would would bring\nin their daughters to another clinic across town to get abortions or or anti abortion women who\nwere actually active in the movement would come and get their own abortions and they always thought,\noh, well, they were the exception and all of these other people were terrible and they but they\nhad real reasons to have an abortion. And and the the you know, the clinic staff would say,\nno, you're you're you have exactly the same reasons that all these other people do.\nRight. I mean, that's a very common that's a very, very common thing. You know, I mean, I\nwhen I was in school in Orange County, which is, you know, very conservative\ncounty in in Southern California right between LA and San Diego, but, you know, I used to be very\nactive with doing like sex ed and, you know, abortion right to what not on campus. And, you know,\nI would, you know, often have, you know, the some of the members of the, you know, the anti-abortion\ngroups sometimes take me aside doing like, hey, can you give me information for a friend?\nRight. Always for a friend. You know, it's that, you know, for a friend or, you know, one of them,\nyou know, was honest and was just like, you know, I mean, a, you know, kind of a bad situation.\nYou know, and I would always provide them information, you know, and and and be like, hey, like, you\nknow, I hope this changes your your position on this issue because, you know, same thing. Everyone\nis, you know, like you, you know, people have abortions because they're protecting their future,\nthey're protecting, you know, your family, their family, their life. I mean, you know, various,\nvarious reasons, right? There's a great quote in the book, having an abortion made me happy.\nI was not forced, I was not forced to become a mother. And and and the idea of testimonials being\nreally sort of powerful, people sharing those stories, people sharing stories like the, you know,\nworking in abortion clinic and seeing these people come in. And then also, you know, statements\nlike that. I've never heard that in an abortion debate. But then, you know, I'm, it's not\nsurprising. I'm, you know, a dude in Britain and I sort of not fully glued up really until reading\nthis book. But I was like, wow, like immediately there's some part of my brain that was like, okay,\nthat's got to be the title of the trailer or the episode because that would just make everyone\nreally mad. Well, I mean, that was one of the major, you know, one of the major aspects of\nabstinence only sex said, I think in terms of, you know, when you're talking about the culture of\nbeing able to discuss these things, you know, did I think really set back an entire generation?\nYes, it did, but only among the really religious and I think no, no, no, no, not at all, not at all.\nI absolutely disagree with that. So, so hang on. So what was the point?\nThe abstinence only sex education that was in schools.\nRight. And that's basically shames people, right?\nWell, it doesn't only shame people. I mean, like, you know, the gay men who's used,\nfor the longest time has been a really strong supporter of reproductive rights, you know,\nback in the 80s and 90s and, you know, early odds, like when I was very active in the issue,\nwas like very, very common to see like many gay men into to the state, the older gay men are,\nbut a lot of the younger gay men are because they've been subjected to abstinence only sex said at\nschools. And yet they're not abstinent. And I have read that in the schools where they teach\nabstinence only, there's a much higher teen pregnancy rate. There is, there is, but there is a\nnix, there is a, you know, so absolutely. It has nothing to do with abstinence. I'm just saying,\nit creates a, you know, if you're going to talk about the culture of, you know, it created a lot\nof shame about abortion, about birth control, about people, you know, also not knowing any basics\nabout their bodies. And I mean, it's, yeah, it's, it's, it's kind of hard to sometimes, you know,\nlike you, you have to do a lot of explaining and informing when, because it's, it's really common\nwhen I talk to people that they don't understand the difference between a birth control pill,\na morning after pill, and then abortion pill. Right. And they need to know. But I think,\nand this is even, even the New York Times gets this wrong. I have to say from watching\nthe discussions of the morning after pill and the abortion pill, they, I mean, even journalists\nare, are guilty of this. Right. Right. Which is, you know, it's not that, it's, I, you know,\nit's not that difficult of, of, they're, they're very, they're, you know, I mean, the birth\ncontrol pill and the morning after pill are somewhat like more closely related together in terms\nof actual pharmaceutical products. Right. But yeah, it's, it's kind, you know, there has been a huge\ngap of, you know, over 10 years, because abstinence only sex education still happens,\nyou know, pretty regularly in public schools. But, you know, of just being able to, you know,\nlet me, none of these programs ever mentioned abortion at all. There's only 17 states in the United\nStates that have biologically correct sex education. So we're really talking about a desert here.\nBut I think a very important thing is the invocation of religion. And the Supreme Court\npassed three pro-religion rules also, parochial schools now get public money. And people can pray\nthat football coach can pray on the football field and so on. And that it's not, it was not illegal\nto have a Christian flag outside of the state house in Boston that they are trying to push\nreligion, which also pushes shame on women. And, you know, the only really good woman in Christ,\nin Catholicism is the Virgin Mary who never had sex. And so, you know, women, that's so much for\nwomen's sexuality. And women are constantly being humiliated and punished for their sexuality\nin the Bible and the Quran. And so, by pushing religion, you push shame on women. However,\nas these organized formal religions fade among young people, religion too is losing its\nclout. And I think they're panicked about that and want to re-invoke religion to teach women\nto be ashamed and responsible for men's transgressions as they were in Genesis,\nand have their husbands rule over them as it says in Genesis. So, there is a whole right wing\nmovement here. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. And that goes to kind of what the American Enterprise\nInstitute guy was talking about is like, we have to somehow create a world in which people think\nthis is what they should be doing, having kids, being in a family, having large families.\nSince we don't have the economic support for that, you know, they're having to\ngin that up pretty far in order to make any difference. But that is definitely the thing.\nAnd, you know, it's interesting because there were thousands and thousands of clergy\nin the late 60s, starting in 1967, there was the clergy consultation service for abortion,\nwhich did abortion referrals to illegal, you know, basically all abortion was illegal at that point.\nSo, to doctors, to doctors, they referred across state lines hoping that would keep the\nprosecutions down. And it did help a little bit. But basically, they relied on these doctors\nwho were willing to risk their practices providing abortions. But they were in almost every state,\nthey were doing counseling and basically a referral service. And this was all, you know,\nprogressive clergy and rabbis and just a bunch of clergy. And where are they right now? Where\nis the pro-choice religious community? I'm sure they're out there, you know, making a lot of noise,\nmaking a lot of noise. But we need to encourage that because, you know, that's the answer to this,\nright? That's part of the answer. Totally. Yeah, exactly. So, and they were very brave about it.\nAnd I think that needs to, that whole idea of a clergy consultation service for abortion\ncould be, could be gotten back up again, because if you're in a legal state, you're going to need\nhelp getting to a legal state to get abortion. And, and why not have a clergy consultation\nservice? Yeah. Well, they have, now they do have other sources plus transportation and payment\nfor your abortion across state lines, but it doesn't have the religious power behind it. However,\nI do say people might not know how to get to it, right? So there have to be a lot of,\nthere have to be a lot of different angles so that this is really available to the maximum number\nof people. And I mean, this is, it's going to be an information war in many ways is to get,\nnot to mention the price, right? And some people can't leave, you know, to fly to New York.\nThey have kids. They have to figure out like child care. They might not trust the, the people that\nthey're, you know, they might not have a trustworthy person to give child care. They, you know,\nit's like all kinds of stuff that you have to arrange in order to just pick up and leave. And so,\nso the other thing that's different from the 60s is the availability of abortion pills. So,\naid access, which is based in Austria will do consultations with you by email text and phone.\nAnd then they will send you the pills from India. They send them into all, all states in the US.\nIt doesn't matter what the laws are. So if people are interested, they should go to aidaccess.org\nto find out they're also doing advanced provisions so that you could have the pills to give to friends\nif they need them. And then planseapills.org does trainings for ambassadors of information on\nthe abortion pill, what's available, how you can get it, the cheapest options and the most reliable,\nplanseapills.org. I highly recommend them. They're very organized. And they actually do have a\nscorecard of various places. You can get the pills, how fast will it be, what's the expense and all\nof that. So, so there are a lot more options and a lot lower barriers to entry than there were\nin the 60s for actually providing abortion services. In the 60s, you actually had to know how to\ndo a procedural abortion in order to provide that. Now we have all these other options. And I should\nmention that the second pill in the abortion pill combination, Ms. Aprostol, is also\neffective on its own, it's much 85% effective and it's much cheaper. It sells under the\nunder the brand name Cytatec. It's often prescribed for to protect your stomach if you're taking\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatories and keep you from getting an ulcer from that. So, so we have\nand that pill is available. It's over the counter in in Mexico and it's available in flea markets in\nTexas and whatnot. So, so there are a lot of options that we have right now that we never had\nin the previous period, which which make it even less likely that they're actually going to be\nsuccessful in raising the birth rate through this. They're just going to make a lot of people miserable.\nAnd this conversation continues for another 30 minutes on our Patreon.

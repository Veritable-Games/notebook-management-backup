We live in humanity's infancy and it's privilege to see the stars as we have the potential to.\r\n\r\nTactile crosswalks that the blind could use to navigate. \"what happens if your ocular sensors go out and the eye repair guy is down three blocks from the bar the eye happened to break at?\" Tactile crosswalks are a must.\r\n\r\nBut irl, for the blind. The feature is perfect.\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/asathingthatistxtimnamibg.txt.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, feature\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.079Z",

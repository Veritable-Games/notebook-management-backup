Filled with civillians. The ACP occupied this facility and used it as a stage of operation for their sabotage of the repopulation effort. \r\n- Language\r\nSordomin's name is reminiscent of the Nordic city that once stood there.\r\nDemonym Sords \r\n- Technology\r\nCesarean section deliveries over a long-period of time may make natural birth impossible. Humans may develop akin to bulldogs, where 90-95% of births are c-sections because of the head size.\r\nRenlei use both fossil fuel and geothermal energy.\r\nHow many resources are requried to build a renlei combat suit. And the special droid units that fight along side them.\r\nRenlei developed acidic rounds because normal ballistics weren't effective in local conflict. Acidic rounds were needed to break through dense, metal armor. \r\n- Culture\r\nmining droids sub-culture\r\n- Architecture\r\nthe renlei border is riddled with giant spike fields. a visual deterrent for anyone that gets too close (visually arresting)\r\n- Government\r\nStratocracy\r\nHomo faber (Binomial nomenclature that means 'working man'), Dreg (derogatory term)\r\nThe sords solve crimes with executions.\r\nnavigating mountanious terrain can be an issue perhaps, drilling technology is of high priority. navigating through these landscapes, rather than around\r\nImagine the renlei shaping the landscape with powerful drill, fire, and explosives\r\nA sense of doom/dread. Line of tanks or some doomsday weapon that the Renlei are slowly rolling across Svalbard. Urgency.\r\nrenlei flamethrowers white phosphorus and thermite rather than napalm\r\nyong-yuan-zhong-cheng (always faithful)\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/Allied_Civil_Preserve_ACP.txt.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, weapon\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.050Z",

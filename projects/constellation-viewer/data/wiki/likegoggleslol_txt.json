The brane-world as a whole is what we need to see recognition of in our language. It is bigger than the verse. A common description in people's knowledge of the world here. They have this knowledge. build incredible technology to see a starry sky. the brane-world\r\n\r\n\r\nTo convey a much larger idea. A much broader whole. \r\n\r\nWe would have the game world span far from the base of the tether itself. You are on a trolley, vast-distances from greater civilization. There are winding paths, almost naturalistic- that span in all directions to create a rooted beauty and naturated variation in what the world of dodec is. these vines are a return to what I had imagined before. this is how we would create something unique. you travel the vines on your tram, and wrap the entirety of the atlas tether. this game has perpetual ideas of scale??????? we have to show restraint though. bring it back, don't show everything at once. \n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/likegoggleslol.txt.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, story\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.145Z",

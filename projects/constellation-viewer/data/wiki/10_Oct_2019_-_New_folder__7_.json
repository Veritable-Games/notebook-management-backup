I think I like to see a wider range of human expressions using body language as a means of communication.\nYou know, like, I need to showcase it. I might record some examples.\nI suppose some reference clips for communication. Stances, postures.\n\n\n====== REC003.txt ======\nSomeone will change their posture after they finish speaking, and this is just a\nfreeze of design\nWhen it's your turn to speak they'll change posture\nOr when you've spoken next they'll change posture I should say\n\n\n====== REC004.txt ======\nuse multiple audio cues to encourage exploration.\nSo in Borderlands 3 you have these radios that are ongoing\nand the player discovers they can turn them off\nby going up to a speaker and pressing E.\nSo using spatial audio, using the sense of sound,\nthey can navigate a space and find these speakers\nas they climb a structure.\nSo imagine that, but there are also other techniques\nlike imagine you can see an artist painting above you.\nEither someone commenting on their work or this year.\nYou see the magic of working on it and you're curious,\nlike can I go up there, can I talk to them?\nAnd you can.\nAnother simpler way of doing this by painting.\n\n\n====== REC005.txt ======\nSo imagine you hear music playing somewhere in the world and you can find\nwhere it is, find the artist, but they're high on the rooftops, they're off\nsomewhere in a corner. You can't quite see. Use realistic audio to kind of use\nsimulated audio to bounce it around in a more realistic way, kind of guiding the\nplayer towards the source. It's going to take some effort.\n\n\n====== REC007.txt ======\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tyo\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n2 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n1 tbc\n4-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0\n0-0-0-0-0\n\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/10_Oct_2019_-_New_folder_(7).txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.012Z",

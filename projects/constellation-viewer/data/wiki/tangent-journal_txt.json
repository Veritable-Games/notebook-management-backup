I’m searching but there still aren’t any characters to see in this world yet. \nIf we’re to recognize the player and their needs, we should also consider the needs of the world we’re trying to build. I’m doing so much searching, I have to refocus my attention on the pages to my left. \nso much unsorted. but it’s a feeling I hope any of you reading this can appreciate. \nI've experienced feeling focused enough to warm the body in games that are expressly violent but I’ve known people to be focused enough in genres I’m unfamiliar with. \nTo life, there are moments in my greatest focus to a friend's words that they hold me in every detail; the shared conversation, attentive focus that gravitates us toward our greatest capacity; \nConciliations with the motions of someone talking; such feeling of presence to each other's minds that we will afford each other absolute attention and reconciliation with one another. \nWhy haven’t we made games so emotionally holding of us? I believe we need to build our confidence to make Autumn a driver to exercise our dear player's greatest abilities to empathize.\n\nthe world we create should afford players moments for self-reflection \nWe should set ourselves to design systems that let the player and characters negotiate with one another. Imagine engaging a player in a graduation towards their most empathetic expression with characters. I'm still not done ideating and sufficiently deprived of sleep, but all I can imagine now is that, to do it right, gameplay progression must contest with the will of other people; again, imagining the characters as people to ensure we give them all the necessary considerations.\nI’m still searching here because I don’t know how this fits but I’ll keep going…\nThis is so much fun. Uncertain, but fun.\nI should know how to give patience for myself; we should afford players that same time\nWe must recognize the great potential for good in people but we’re not born giving creatures\nAltruism is a learned characteristic\nI know I have no power of my own to fix it but through this act of creation I think we can present people with fictionalized opportunities for greater empathy\nthe works we’re able to make should afford the generations after us meaning where they otherwise don’t find it in their lives. games have the potential to be something so much more profound to us\n\nI think we should exaggerate the biodiversity of the world only slightly. \nI greatly understand the need to consider scope, but a realistic representation would mean so much more to me. I think we’re not seeing the world right. There’s more beyond the rooms and roads we’ve inherited\nthe world is broken, Autumn can be used to help us reflect on that.\n[12:10 AM]Glitch: I think Autumn should only have light appearance changes for sake of scope. \nabilities should allow for multiple solutions to puzzles or scenarios\nspecialized abilities to advance the objectives\n\nthe theme may be that [people only behave as they do]\nautumn cannot solve the world's problems by regarding\none person. asking of one person to fix things will not\nhelp. she needs to talk-to and gather many peoples\nthat would see to these greater problems of everyones\n\nbehavior is only predictable by the 'enact' models\nnever explicitly known to the player unless we reveal\nthem with the symbols. they happen all the time in\neach character's background thoughts. they likewise\nhave variable reactions depending on the scales of\nthe conversation Autumn is engaging in. \n\neach character should have metrics weighed by these\nsame symbols. if anyone does math we'll need to find\na balance to their distribution and utility in talks. I think\nenough variety would mean we have good engagement.\n\nso, this one is uber important to me. but I’d like us to consider having a hub world and imagine a way for it to play a significant role in the story. players ought to feel compelled to return to it and spend time there.\ngive them a home to feel a connection to; remember our ideas on the floating tree world.\n\nlimit the player’s direct control over the world. they can move stuff, not people. people move on their own accord and it’s up to the player to negotiate wants from them.\n\nI'd like to try my hand at animation with some hardware I haven't made much use of. I have a base-station HMD and extra peripherals that’d work well for animation\nThe setup I have now can track the feet and waist, and I've got an alternative device for tracking your hands. I'm aware the system can handle more for extra detail so I might allow myself the expense \nThere’s this dusty tracking peripheral that will let me record natural hand animation that the HMD’s controllers wouldn’t be able to make.\nAll I have to do is mount the device to get a good view of the hands; thinking on 3d printing\nI’m only ideating, but maybe I'll export animations from the vr rig, do almost keyframing to that original recording and go back to add other traits to a character’s movement\ncheck out one by the name of Cascadeur; physically accurate, procedural AI animation\nthinking on Havoc for in-world physics but that would definitely mean a paid license so we should asses how important physics would be; I am aware of free alternatives. Unity’s built-in stuff wouldn’t be bad.\n\nall this text really isn’t all that intimidating. It’ll just take some patience to organize\nafford players a sense of presence/groundedness unlike anything they’ve ever had in games before\nI’m confident these symbols will allow for much greater player expression \n[12:10 AM]Glitch: Here's our shared link for Autum's design bible so far, lots of work to be done. @LittleNorwegians I have to get you invited to the doc so you can see what we're after.  I've done what I can to find a feel for the game. One of the stronger themes that I've written out here goes, \"We must recognize the great potential for good in people but we’re not born giving creatures. Altruism it is a learned practice\" - and to my immediate attention. \"We must give players opportunities to fully consider the people in this world. There are narrative and design affordances we can create to have them consider others; do it right, and they will have no choice but them to reconcile their own wants and needs against the wants and needs of others. – Or to say again in another way, the game only goes on if they continue to negotiate against the wants and needs of other people in the world.\"\nThe world we live in is so overwhelmingly broken. We're not seeing it to accurate models in our minds and therefore we cannot fathom the loss of life happening now. Biodiversity is being lost to us and the planet's future hold on life will falter if we're not careful to maintain what we have. The Earth may precede humanity and if so we abuse it to our downfall, it will outlast us still. We've no adequate attention or care to the home we've called our own for 4.5 billion years. The Earthling's children span far removed from Homo sapiens; our form has thrived against the greater will of long-ago forgotten, often unrecognized, and deeply forsaken family. \nAutumn ought to evoke our greatest ability to empathize; invite a player’s most honest presence to the game by showing them paths to reflect on others in the world. To do it as I imagine, we must hold to our minds that the characters we create are literal people, and as such they could reflect on themselves and see wholly of the world we create. I think we must set ourselves apart from the player in much of the design. We should create affordances that would let a player attune themselves to feelings from other people.

It's in our shared Google Doc, but I did not mention it you you yet, @Scuds. I will leave the link to that asset here. My quickest descriptor would be that it's novel ping-pong-like dialogue system that was built to let the player move freely and bounce discussion between multiple conversation partners using symbols to further express themselves.\n[12:10 AM]Glitch: LT/RT | LeftMouse/RightMouse to converse. There are a handful of symbols I commissioned to accentuate emotive tones carried in the game I'd be working  on. They had meaning to them, and I can only go and post the old art if you'd like greater sense of the undercooked and untested system. The symbols were fully commissioned work so I've full rights to their use. They are as follows, Pain/ Pleasure, Aggression/Fear, Elation/Misery, Desire/Aversion, Depression/Balance. And there were four more planned that I did not get art done for and will need finished if either of you take an interest in using these for the systems I'm prodding at to exist with all this writing.

Learn to read and best utilize each of the symbols by interacting with characters and seeing how they respond. \n\nProgression is marked by resolution of puzzle-like interpersonal scenarios.\nLearn to navigate the wide-ranging problems of the world’s inhabitants.\n\nUsing ‘enacts’ should convey patterns the player can learn to recognize. Intend to subvert player expectations by giving characters drivers not known to the player; reasons to react differently than may be expected. Characters will be able to drive their own conversations. Difficulty may come from balancing the player’s wants/will with that of the wants/will of these people. \n\nExposure to each of the symbols is done gradually, new scenarios will help the player familiarize themselves with each of the symbols. We can prepare them for increasingly complex scenarios and faster engagement as their intuition for the symbols develops. \n\nWe should seek to create a wanting in the player for the time of characters; removed from any puzzles or their gamified drivers, we should design and write to give the player opportunities to see that these characters, these people will also want to spend time for themselves and others. -- The player must likewise be afforded a feeling that they are allowed moments for themselves, too. \n\nWe give the player opportunities to ask of people. People will often ask of the player.  Both the characters and the player can reject said asks. Opportunities to make progression alone exists but may come with greater difficulties.\n\nPeople can throw a lot at you, and not everyone has the fortitude to give patience; \nDifficulty may come through how taxing a conversation becomes to stay engaged.\nYour varied engagement with a conversation will mean alternative character interactions.\n\nGiven the full range of expressions, I believe we’ve the opportunity to create some very compelling moments. \nI’m gonna have to give each of the symbols incredible consideration before this really clicks, I think. \n\nSome short pitches,\nAutumn seeks to teach us and prepare us for the tale we’ve to sow ourselves\nAutumn is practice on our greatest abilities to empathize and recognize one another\n[12:50 AM]Glitch: Let’s say Autumn is someone born with [....]; [...] \n\nshe gives as she may; so do her sister seasons\nmore that give; as they may, those of great Nature and still, Autumn’s sister seasons. \n\nThough still, she is so unable to ask of others; so far-removed from the idea of being wanted for- Autumn may only set herself aside in every effort.\n\nThough the sister seasons do so well to find resolution in people’s problems, the forest is seeing a growing neglect. The people content themselves with distractions in isolation from one another. If these so-problems they face are felt in solitude, they-likewise do not know how to ask for help. Autumn does all she may for them in the time Mother Nature sets her to work. So giving in her days- so minded to other people, so happy and content to those that see her from the outside looking in. Autumn does all she may to give recognition to those souls that keep to themselves. \n\n[There is no draw to an adventure; no compelling movement of the narrative beyond the people of the forest] \n[12:53 AM]Glitch: Player ‘Enact’ Expression Mechanics\n\nThis will definitely take time; I’ve yet to spend what’s necessary to describe it. And because of how old the system is; how far removed it is from my mind, I’d have a hard time re-describing what it is and how it’s meant to work.\n\nFeatures\nalternative to traditional dialogue/conversion systems\nstarting from the initiating interaction from a character/NPC\nmore opportunities for player expression, save for what’s ‘spoken’\nvisualized audio files for voice lines\nnodes, tangents, \n\nSymbols for Expression ‘Enacts’\n\nSymbol of Desire: What we want for, the expression that draws us towards people and things in life. Do you want this? Yes.\n\nExamples using the ‘Desire’ enact,\nBear’s made a cake and it looks like a delight. Do you want to say you’d like a piece?\n\nSymbol of Aversion: What we do not want for, the expression that repels us from everything in life. Do you want this? No.\n\n\t\t\tExamples using the ‘Aversion’ enact,\nUse it to reject gifts, reject asks of people, say that you do not want for something.\nSomeone offers you blueberries, they look like they’ve bruised a few. Do you say no?\nA person that’s fond of you expresses an interest in you, but you do not share in it.\nSymbol of Elation: The feelings of joy in our lives; an expression for ourselves and for others to say that we like something.\n\nExamples using the ‘Elation’ enact,\nYou’ve come home after one’s toiling away and family bounds to the door; they greet you with the happiest gesture and a meow. You cannot help but smile and love them.\nKnowing you are cared for, that a friend would step in to help. Elated, almost tearful.\nA feeling in receiving expressions of love; lighthearted to the self and to so many more.\nSmiles live here. In it, find approval of friends and those you harbor great feelings for.\n\nSymbol of Misery: The feelings that afford us feelings of sorrow or faint longing; feelings on bad or ineffectual expression.\n\nExamples using the ‘Misery’ enact,\nA person has given you a hard boundary in a relationship; you have feelings of rejection\nYou feel misunderstood, you spend the rest of the day thinking about what happened\nPain can reflect on misery and likewise misery on pain; the two are anchors for us.\n\nSymbol of Pleasure: Fair appreciation for a feeling, warm, contented. Feelings of being accepted or wanted for; feeling full. \n\nExamples using the ‘Pleasure’ enact,\nA \nYou\nSomeone\n\nSymbol of Pain: An affliction to bring us better experience; reminders of injury to the self or ego.

Dead Space 2023: there was a moment in the game; though I can't remember if this was how it was designed with the first iteration of the title. You are given an ability earlier on, the thing of telekinesis, using this sci-fi psychic power you can pick up objects, throw them.* I've noticed that they may have had to run these through many iterations to get just right.* The thing of picking up a box is learned quickly, you can use it to defend yourself in the combat circumstances in the game.  You may have fun throwing these boxes around and get a good feel for them in a few moments; there comes one, where a doorway prevents your further progression. \n\nThere are two small boxes, each marked with this recurring symbol used to denote an object that would describe it's telekinetic accessibility; you may pick up one of the boxes with your power, knock it around; notice as you throw the thing, your path is obstructed by the bigger box you may have thought would nudge for you. No other such obstacles have been present. You are the fool that walked into a wall. But, the thing of these markings exist and you will see them present on the big box too. Pick up the small box, hit the big box, and there you have a tutorial in its own right.

I have made this channel private for I am fearful of those consequences of hate. \n\nThe thing of love, I believe; or the value to say we are only to love one other; though admirable, and shared-joyously in best intent, one much truly share so much of themselves to a singular one person; I think [his] expectation for a singular other is so-said to be [poor].

All consequence [from] our economic-drivers of growth and\nall these inherited organizations that would keep production of what we would need and not.\n\nWhy do we enjoy games? \nWhat are the literal attributions of behavior that keep us so-engaged? \nGames are good for us; great even- but: \"Where does our joy come from?\" \nOr, \"What keeps us occupied from moment to moment as we play  them?\"\n \n[2:59 PM]Glitch: removed from ⁠Unknown ||The thing here is contentious, \n[-] I believe that the thing of such [severe] bondage to [a] single-\nother soul; though I so-see that so many would find themselves \nin such severe of heart.

The thing of distance in separation. \n[8:23 PM]Glitch: I couldn't put functional language to it but I don't think we've got a good model of the universe. They say the universe is expanding but it's curved? We have all these weird visual models; none of them so maintain our understanding of general physics. The images are reflected on our understanding of math. Our mathematical models are incomplete. We do not have a theory of everything or the universe as is. If we asked a computer how to replicate the thing from scratch, we couldn't say how to do it. Everything is systemic in the way of determinism. I don't think any of the models I've been exposed to hold up to the real thing. If there was a great expansion, it didn't curve into a disc or a cone or a a twisted ring of sorts. If this lines up with any of our grounded-to the world models. The universe is a sphere, we may not be looking at the center; but the 'greater star' of one its surface entities. If the universe is not expanding, but accelerating these immense; distances of space between pockets of dense matter; clouds, gases, immense stars so variegated in scale, the distance among each of them so immense. We see buck a sliver of the surface of the galaxy's sky. And I do not believe we would be able to see its center. Our fact of birth as a galaxy means we are rushing away from whatever this pocket of matter was, in all directions- like the stars, floating in a much larger vacuum of everything. We cannot see it we cannot see the edge of the universe because light may not travel forever indefinitely. We are speeding apart from the 'great expansion' big bang, tiny pocket of matter in this bigger universe.\n[8:32 PM]Glitch: We are on a surface of an invisible density of unseen matter; on bigger 'big bangs' the rushing away effect may be that light cannot go forever. We may not see other galaxies come into our horizon; not until our models are far more complete. We will see more patterns  emerge when we observe further and for much longer spans of time. There may be no telling indefinitely or unless our mathematical concepts find us at a true theory of everything.\n\nHow does it follow that this thing that is not like the universe we know but, also- and not like the universe we know. These models I've seen get so very warped; it's almost like the caricatures you'd see medieval artists paint of the creatures they had described to them. Our star was not the beginning of all things. We are we  small pocket of matter across this 'horizon' of the universe. If the universe is the curved surface of the earth's oceans, we can only see so far around us in every direction. Light cannot reach the greatest depths of the ocean, how are we to suppose it goes out forever into the darkest unknowns of the universe? Light cannot carry forever. We're only seeing the glimmer of a glimpse of the universe and all its wonders. \n\nWe are seeing curved space because it is in fact a curve. We are a tiny light among a pocket of floating space. Our technology cannot see far out enough yet but we will find one day that there are other galaxies rushing toward us. \n\nSo much variety as we are flung further out that we would not recognize that the universe was once thought to be dying. Entropy goes on, but matter cannot be created or destroyed. The matter does not go to oblivion, but go out against the gravity of space and these other unknown forces that hold us apart. If we are on the surface of the universe rather than the 'birthed from the center of it'; we may see that time will go on indefinitely. Humanity's nascencey does not see the 'edge' of what is not visible to us. Light may not travel so far indefinitely. \n\nRadio disperses; other matter slows in comparison. We have not measured such distance time that light may slow. How are you to say that a photon lasts forever? Do they run out of mass as the atoms spin on for untold epochs of time? We are not losing the universe, we are blinded by its holdings of physics and our limited perspective on these galactic shores. \n[1:16 AM]Glitch: from a letter to valve\nremoved text\nI have crazy ideas for different types of gameplay loops for character-centric dialogue that may hold people's attention 'active', sensations [or real, if OpenAI would be seen workable] rehetorical conversations; this imagination of good conversations with characters that may so-better retain the present-mind of someone playing.

Others are still so distance; but it's not myself I want to reconcile on it's these greater ideas on what people can mean \nthemselves to be; the ways our values are inherited to things of nurture:nature; these much physical knowings of what we are in \nDNA;RNA, epigenetics: the thing that reflects from behavior to modify [these things of internal and social balance]; , \n\nWe tie ourselves to people in the way of what I'm trying to figure on with the 'enacts'; greater to games, not so literal to life- \nbut we may create a thing that is done with design to best help people.

You may say we as \nbrothers, sisters; mothers, fathers- family and friends. To all those still others we would call close. You may only say 'We' as people in \ncontext to all others.

The\nthing of knowledge is interesting, in that; ways we talk to people give personal ideation to what's said [exactingly so]. Language comes\na sort of recognition in other people. The thing of live is that we have unseen relational distances. I may care as I do. I may care as I so\nhope to. My givings are not good enough. My behavior is not amended enough.

Light bounces reflects, 'gets absorbed' ended or reattributed to our eyes. We do not see the death of light in our lives. But as all things in wavelengths; even radio signals, light dies; so thus its not the end of the universe we're seeing or the 'forever losing of everything'; it's just that distances go on beyond the capacities of light to reach us. Light cannot go forever. This model of the universe is exactingly related to this model of the whole 'verse' not being readily visible to us; but present nonetheless.\"\n\nWe are on a surface of an invisible density of unseen matter; on bigger 'big bangs' the rushing away effect may be that light cannot go forever.

To achieve this we need consider the emotional ties that players have with the characters, and use the narrative to keep the players focused on the game. Built-well, the dialogue system would take into account the player's level of boredom and adjust the conversation accordingly. — A high level of boredom means that the character would talk to the player automatically, while a low level of boredom means that the character may disengage with the conversation. The goal is to create a narrative that keeps the players centered in the experience, with strong emotional ties to the characters, which in turn would keep [their own] attention. The idea is to have a dialogue system that is more engaging, and that utilizes good writing to keep the players interested.\n\n\nWe have a have a responsibility to anyone we would see ourselves to relationships with. responsibilities to our parents, to our children, to work and may-be study.

Wright The Future of Architecture [1930] [1931] [1939]\nThe idealistic always has been under suspicion as a performer, —perhaps justly. The explorer [Henry Morton Stanley] wrote of a monkey cause and tied up overnight by [them]; a rope around his neck.  the money gnawed the rope in two and [escaped], the knot still tied around his neck. Next morning, found the monkey with this strange \"necktie\" trying to go home, but each approach to rejoin the tribe would bring wild cries from his fellows and such commotion, —no doubt inspired by the Scribes, —that the monkey \"with something about him\" now, —would stop, dazed, pull at his \"experience\" a little, and think it over. Then he would move toward his fellows and such commotion, —no doubt inspired by the Scribes, —that the monkey \"with something about him\" now, —would stop, dazed, pull at \"his experience\" a little, and think it over. Then he would move toward his fellows again, but such commotion would be result that he would have to give it up. The Scribes had succeeded with the Pharisees. This kept up all day because the poor money kept on trying to come home, (to \"tell the truth\"?). Finally just before dark, the whole tribe, exasperated, rushed upon the suspected money . . . tore him limb from limb. \n\nMonkey psychology? Of course; our own tribe, too, often destroys on similar suspicion the man who might impart something of tremendous importance and value to his tribe. [...] In our own tribe we have another tendency, the reverse side of this same shield, and that tendency, no doubt inherited too, hails the monkey with delight, puts on rope-ends likewise, makes them the fashion, soon ostracizing any money without the fashionable necktie. \n\n- But the absorbed idealist, ecocentric-inventor in the realm of the thought-built, has a hard time with us socially, financially, and with peculiar force, morally.\n[9:12 PM]Glitch:\nIn addition to the instinctive fear for the safety of the tribe, in our form of social contract the man with an idea seems to have become an invidious reflection upon his many fellows who have none. And certain effects belonging naturally to the idealist, —such as belief in himself as having caught sight of something deeper, wider, higher or more important just beyond, mark him. He, all unsuspecting, will appear soon on the \"path\" as peculiar to his own individuality in ways the poor fool, less absorbed, would have realized as unimportant if true, and have kept under cover. Ridicule from his many fellows, safely in the middle of the road, is always ready. And now it is only the incurably young person, in our country, who ever attempts to break through all down the line—and is laughed out of countenance, laughed out of job, and eventually out of house and home. \n\n- But at the absorbed idealistic the tribe has laughed wrong so many times that the prevailing \"middle of the road egoists\" are getting sensitive on the subject. They should realize, as Carlyle reminded us—himself a perfectly good specimen of the absorbed egocentric,— \"Great thoughts, great hearts once broke for, we breathe cheaply as the common air.\" History will continue to repeat itself: the \"middle of the road egoist\" will keep breathing \"cheaply\", and the egocentric hearts will keep on breaking in the cause of ideas.\n[9:12 PM]Glitch:\n- But our \"middle of the road egoist\" is not safe as he imagines. He may as well face the fact that just as commerce has no soul, and therefore cannot produce as life, —so no inventive genius on the commercial or the mechanical plane can preserve him now. In a flood of carbon-monoxide he is hell bound for somewhere and he does not know where. Ask him! He is trapped by the device, soon to be victimized, do doubt, by a faith in devices, now become a device in itself, and soon as seen as a fool's faith that failed. Meantime machine-overproduction has made the statesman a propagandist for the poor, the banker a bulkhead, the salesman a divinity.\n[6:39 PM]Glitch:\ncrazy text but imagine I am a person in some wild narrative adventure game\n\nPlease remove my persona here. I am not important to the text. This writing must speak to all the disparaged people and those than can do nothing but spend their time to making money for the sake of rent. [I cannot say that] But the rest needs good recognition. Please, help me to this.\n\nThis text is terrible and hard to recognize. Please bring it down to some considered, deliberative- regarding to what we could really do with our time and wealth to help people and the world. Would you please use your best imagination to say what we would do if all the wealth of land and property be reduced to pennies- people hold right to life, right to their hearth and home. \n\nPeople have far and beyond the thing of right to speech. We must recognize our right to water, food, healthcare, childcare, education, all the responsibilities to hold this civilization to good operation. Please bring this text down to something relatable for people and expound on it as best you can to do good for them.\n\nThis interface is so strange on desktop. I don't know if any of this will read differently. I think my writing loses clarity a lot. Much rather talk to anyone in person than go over text or long letters to say what I'd like to. 'Too pushy', maybe is the criticism. Not the people person I may imagine myself to be. No matter how well-intentioned I may be there is a withdraw from interest if I keep holding to myself to haste without merit of good language.\n\nChatGPT, model 4. This technology has, will, and can only continue to upend so much of our traditional labor. People's time to work has only recently gone to this overabundance. If we see the value of our dollar now- in this moment, we might change the world overnight. Your wealth accrued may afford you several months of rent or a good year of timely mortgage payments.\n[6:39 PM]Glitch:\nThe amount that does for someone that is not so privileged in ties to this strange economy is absurd to your most incredible awe. 'Of the people that have nothing but are so willing to help anyway, of the people that would give and give until they could not'. Any of those others that see themselves in good recognition of Fortune may find that the thing of this economy does not see or care to recognize our deepest souls to live this life in earnest.\n\nI cannot find solidarity at my apartment complex when all the population is afforded right to residence by way of parentage. There is an undertone of need-to-be-known hypocrisy in my own reliance on family and friends for aid to life recently. More to some over others. \n\nOwing my life to do well with it, I think we ought to see that our [fantasy] is half-imagined to housing and a sheer enormity of it wrapped in hellscapes of monetary growth.\n\nIf you see good interest in my writing. We ought to suddenly say that the landlords and banks do not contribute anything useful to society by our owing to them in such extremities. They would not need for the wealth. We would rather see expenditures on rent and mortgages gone to our healthcare needs, education, childcare; then, too- recognize may be defend, our right to home and hearth, all those things that would sustain us.\n\nIf we cannot lay out picket lines we must restrain their thieving from us. Put your rent towards family, friends, and all that you would need. If housing will collapse anyway, let's reap from them before they would see to reap from us. Pay what you would owe to your loved ones and those in good care, but do not see your wealth go to the oligarchs. Give back to your neighbors here and those so far away. We can amend the world overnight if we see our power to the thing of 'no' all at once.\n[6:39 PM]Glitch:\nWasting ourselves to imaginations of having property. Rent and mortgage are so normal if you are well off, but it's theft of another kind to those that would need more than work enables.\n[11:27 AM]Glitch: Agent 5 responded: There are several financial incentives available for using solar energy systems in private homes. Some of the most common incentives include:\n\n1. Federal Tax Credits: The federal government offers a tax credit of up to 26% of the solar installation cost for both residential and commercial properties. This credit is available until December 31, 2022.\n\n2. State-level Incentives: Many states offer financial incentives for installing solar energy systems. These incentives can include rebates, tax credits, and performance-based incentives.\n\n3. Net Metering: Net metering is a billing arrangement that allows solar panel owners to receive credits for excess electricity their panels generate and feed back to the grid. This can help reduce electricity bills.\n\n4. Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs): SRECs are a tradable commodity that represent the generation of one megawatt-hour (MWh) of solar electricity. They can be sold to utility companies that need to meet state renewable energy targets.\n\n5. Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) programs: PACE programs provide financing for residential renewable energy and energy efficiency improvements that are then paid back through property taxes.\n\nIt's important to note that eligibility criteria, incentive amounts, and program availability may vary by location. It's a good idea to check with your local utility company, state agency, or a licensed solar installer to determine which incentives are available in your area.\n[8:04 PM]Glitch: M-Theory is a hypothetical framework that proposes a unifying theory of all fundamental forces and particles. It is based on the idea of duality between gravity and quantum mechanics, which is known as the holographic principle. This principle states that the physics in any region of space-time can be described by a lower-dimensional boundary of space-time. M-Theory is still being studied and developed, and its implications are still being explored.\n[8:06 PM]Glitch: I can tell you that M-theory is a consistent theory of something, and there is evidence for the existence of branes in string theory, which appear consistent mathematically and theoretically despite not being related to the real world. The deep structure of the theory has revealed connections between theories and calculations that all lead to the same answer, showing that the branes of string theory are real and consistent objects.\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/tangent-journal.txt.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, character-design, dialogue, item, location, story, quest, feature, gameplay, mechanic, fix\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.204Z",

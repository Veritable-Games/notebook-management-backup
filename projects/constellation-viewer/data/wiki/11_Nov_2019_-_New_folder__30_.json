Be attention to detail. And I feel like we'll use an urban\nenvironment you can interact with, be really interesting. And when we can do walls and\nbreak, what can we do at least?\n\n\n====== REC005.txt ======\nImagine you're walking around the facility, or not, jeez.\n\n\n====== REC006.txt ======\nyour tree.

Just as long as not bad, not bad, just like that.\nThe exact thing I hate all over me.\nThat said, they are pretty loud doing the day, so I don't think I was hearing.\nNo, so it's not...\n\n\n====== REC013.txt ======\nSo another example to my soul, but for Kutulu, Kutulu builds up stress.\nKutulu builds up anxiety, and the anxiety is either disperse through play, or disperse\nthrough a version of anxiety built up in the human sense.\nHe needs to step away.\nThis is too much.\nHe can't handle it.\nHe can't handle all the betting and the loving.\nBut that's okay.\nHe needs his space.\nSo you've got to understand the level of anxiety that your little buddy goes through.\nAnd how he kills comfortable.\nAnd he'll come to you in time.\nAnyway, hypothetically.\nWell, for Hollian, most hypothetically, theoretically.\nOkay, so there's an anxiety fear.\nNow there's an anxiety built up, and it's expressed as, well, anxiety, fear, or aggression.\nAn anxiety exists as a thing in organisms, and also he just says as a, as a, a separate behavior.\nOr a described behavior, a categorized behavior.\nIt's really a, a greedy entry, right?\nBut these symbols of language are inadequate to describe the radius.\nThe radius is anxiety leads to extreme anxiety, fear, or aggression.\n\n\n====== REC014.txt ======\n1 o'clock\n1 o'clock\n1 o'clock\n1 o'clock\n1 o'clock\n1 o'clock\n1 o'clock\n1 o'clock\n1 o'clock\n1 o'clock\n1 o'clock\n1 o'clock\n1 o'clock\n1 o'clock\n1 o'clock\n1 o'clock\n\n\n====== REC015.txt ======\nDeath is at a 23.5 degree tilt towards the sun.\n\n\n====== REC016.txt ======\nHow long does it take for the light movement to reach us?\n\n\n====== REC017.txt ======\nStudy game play loops. Look at the games you finished. I'm trying to understand why they were so successful.\nHow did Mirror Edge? Mirror Edge can't be coming back. What was the loop?\nHow did I know what's gonna be coming back? Oh, what was the loop? And I think I know what the loop is there.\nIt's a matter of understanding the mechanics.\nThe dynamics, the aesthetics, the narratives, the pits and pieces that make up the game.\nAnd we are articulating them into the core, not the loops, the procession of plants.\nThe elliptical orbits of gameplay loops.\n\n\n====== REC018.txt ======\nthe elliptical orbits of game loops, multiple game systems coming together to form the feeling of a game, the pacing in a loop that is none specific to\nbetter non-specific to each other, I can mentor Vania, I need to take this better on just having fun to get him out of the groove\n\n\n====== REC019.txt ======\nGameplay grooves to fall into, a sense of rhythm, a sense of pace, a well-designed game\nand its levels are like an intricate ballet of mechanics, narrative and the wonderful\narray of interplaying systems that build a game and its experience.\n\n\n====== REC020.txt ======\nGameplay loops, no. Gameplay grooves. Don't have to be.\n\n\n====== REC021.txt ======\nFun. Old school gel, which he's turned a lot of people off because they're called loops\nthat being individual turns of a combat encounter are usually pretty boring. However, die hard\nfans of RPGs love them because they play some massive emphasis on high level, meta gameplay\nloops. We get to see your characters and the story evolve over the tens of hours. This\nwhole gameplay loops are just steps that will savage your goal by offering up plop.\nDo the steps have to be tedious? I'm sorry, but that's okay, it's too mean. Steps don't\nhave to be tedious, they can be interesting. The steps don't have to be boring, the steps\ndon't have to be, how do you be nice to write that? Do I have to be blame? You have to be\nblame for once. I have to kind of offend people a little bit, just a little bit. Hey,\nJRPGs are kind of boring. I love the narrative of the characters, but I hate their\ngame play. If I could get the gameplay, I'd be able to be totally happy. Sorry, not sorry.\n\n\n====== REC022.txt ======\nI just know you know my heart's aching\nLoved I've organized my face\nAs we, sons and sisters\nSeasons have shown how your providence takes change\nOh, my life till I shut off\nBruce, by the moon's battle\nLeft, stick, and I don't replace\nGaring a form lifted\nMassage a door to physics\nIn minutes, I leave evidence to your answer\nOpen forced marriage\nAnd I'll be right back,\nI'll be right back,\nI'll be right back,\nI'll be right back,\nI'll be right back,\nI'll be right back,\nI'll be right back,\nI'll be right back,\nI'll be right back,\nI'll be right back,\nI'll be right back,\nI'll be right back,\nI'll be right back,\nI'll be right back,\nI'll be right back,\nI'll be right back,\nI'll be right back,\nI'll be right back,\nLong, tall, silly goose, why did you hide behind governance of shame?\nSmooth and splendid abuse, won't you tell me how to deal with my ego?\nSworn by thorns of foe, I'll bow and call the sheep away from forever in your kiss.\nLong, tall, silly goose, why did you hide behind governance of shame?\nLong, tall, silly goose, why did you hide behind governance of shame?\nLong, tall, silly goose, why did you hide behind governance of shame?\nLong, tall, silly goose, why did you hide behind governance of shame?\nLong, tall, silly goose, why did you hide behind governance of shame?\n\n\n====== REC023.txt ======\nyou know.\n\n\n====== REC025.txt ======\nI am on my own safe for the close friends.\nI taught this game about my teaching about this game.\nI am on my own safe for the close friends.\n\n\n====== REC026.txt ======\n–¢–∞–∫ –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ.\n–¢–∞–∫, –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ.\n\n\n====== REC027.txt ======\nThe friends I talk with about this game.\n\n\n====== REC028.txt ======\nand it's not sure that the Earth's not sure that game is for the Earth's first.\nI could try to put it, it's finding a collective thing,\nbecause that one's both fries.\nSo I forgot the,\nit's me, the Earth's myself,\nof course.\nChris says.\nChris says.\nChris says.\nChris says.\nThere are three branches of development in this game.\nThere you have the overall lore,\nyou have the character interactions,\nand you have the levels in and of themselves,\nacting as a metrophilia like Labyrinth for a minimum of three hours at first,\nwith this prototype.\nIt builds up into more content as the game develops new areas,\nnew sections of the maps that slowly unlock for time-imagined.\nI'll have to try it out.\nI'll have to try it out of the map.\nIt's like a baseball plane.\nI have a little, a little more erratic.\nI've got it, I know it's your next.\nI'm good to go.\n\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/11_Nov_2019_-_New_folder_(30).txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, character-design, story, gameplay, mechanic\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.016Z",

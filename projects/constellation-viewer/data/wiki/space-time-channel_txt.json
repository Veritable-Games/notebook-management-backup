Quality, knowledge and creativity since 1477. World-class research and first-rate education of global use to society, business, and culture. Uppsala University is one of northern Europe's most highly ranked universities.\r\n[11:14 PM]Glitch: https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.261301\r\nPhysical Review Letters\r\nEmergent de Sitter Cosmology from Decaying Anti--de Sitter Space\r\nRecent developments in string compactifications demonstrate obstructions to the simplest constructions of low energy cosmologies with positive vacuum energy. The existence of obstacles to creating scale-separated de Sitter solutions indicates a UV/IR puzzle for embedding cosmological vacua in a unitary theory of quantum gravity.

It is an attempt to develop a quantum theory of gravity based directly on Einstein's geometric formulation rather tha...\r\nLoop quantum gravity\r\n[1:18 AM]Glitch: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_geometry\r\nInformation geometry\r\nInformation geometry is an interdisciplinary field that applies the techniques of differential geometry to study probability theory and statistics. It studies statistical manifolds, which are Riemannian manifolds whose points correspond to probability distributions.\r\nInformation geometry\r\n[1:19 AM]Glitch: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space\r\nMetric space\r\nIn mathematics, a metric space is a set together with a notion of distance between its elements, usually called points. The distance is measured by a function called a metric or distance function. Metric spaces are the most general setting for studying many of the concepts of mathematical analysis and geometry.\r\nThe most familiar example of a m...\r\nMetric space\r\n[1:24 AM]Glitch: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information\r\nQuantum information\r\nQuantum information is the information of the state of a quantum system. It is the basic entity of study in quantum information theory, and can be manipulated using quantum information processing techniques. Quantum information refers to both the technical definition in terms of Von Neumann entropy and the general computational term.\r\nIt is an i...\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/space-time-channel.txt.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, mechanic\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.197Z",

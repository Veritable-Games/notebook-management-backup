Hall ======\n0:03\nwell I'm happy to see so many of you have survived\n0:11\nwe have an interesting subject this morning that it comes down to the daily living\n0:18\nof the things we believe I've often heard people get very\n0:24\neloquent discussions on principles and ideals but many of them are still in trouble\n0:30\nthemselves they are unable to escape from habit\n0:35\npatterns and from the traditional backgrounds from which we have all come in one way\n0:42\nor another I suppose that the present generation is\n0:47\none of the most complicated in the history of humanity not only\n0:52\nis it complicated because the rapid advancements in various fields of\n0:59\nscientific progress but it is Complicated by a general\n1:05\nRevolution against tradition most people are blaming tradition\n1:12\nfor the conditions that they are in today they feel that in some way\n1:17\nwe were prevented from growing in the very early years of our culture\n1:24\nactually however most of the Traditions which have survived\n1:29\nhave some foundation in facts and facts do not change easily or\n1:36\nreadily or quickly and our general background of tradition\n1:42\nis essentially idealistic this means that a percentage of people\n1:49\nhad strong convictions and lived by them or tried to this does not mean that all nations were\n1:57\ncontrite and honorable it does not follow that all people have\n2:03\never United in any constructive Enterprise but there was an undercurrent a\n2:09\nfoundation of integrities which are which this Foundation is at\n2:15\nthis time especially unpleasant to contemplate we do not want to\n2:22\nre-establish the foundations of survival we do not believe any longer in the\n2:30\ngolden rule we talk about it we write about it but when it comes in\n2:36\nconflict with personal interests we forget the traditional Integrity that is\n2:43\nat the basis of our civilization nearly every great teacher of the past\n2:49\nhas brought us a traditional integrity they have all done their best to call to\n2:56\nour attention the realities of values in most instances some listen to them\n3:05\nin many cases they were persecuted and martyred\n3:10\nbut out of it all came a lingerings stream of ideals that simply refused to\n3:17\ndie and these ideals were the integrities upon which modern life has been built\n3:25\nbut Integrity is often interfere with selfishness\n3:31\nthey interfere with being exactly as free as we want to be\n3:37\nwe were willing to fight and struggle desperately to get physical freedom\n3:43\nand most persons have achieved a considerable degree of it but this personal freedom has not been\n3:51\nbrought under the censorship of integrities we feel that we can do anything we want\n3:57\nto but we do not curb integrate or educate the desire structure within ourselves\n4:05\nso today we are confronted by a complicated situation that is disturbing and\n4:14\nfrightening millions of human beings According to some late statistics which\n4:20\nwe have received the worldest year has increased its population by 82 Millions\n4:28\nlooking forward into the future at a situation of this kind is very disturbing\n4:34\nbecause every year where populations increase sacrifices must be made\n4:41\nin order to maintain this increased population\n4:47\neach individual has to work a little harder gain a little less give a little more\n4:54\nand be more patient than he ever was before he is also going to find continual\n5:01\nencroachments upon all the materialistic values that he has become accustomed to\n5:08\nthe greater the population the more each individual must give up\n5:15\npersonal ambitions if he does not the entire structure will\n5:20\nfall apart everyone today is a little bit disturbed\n5:26\nsome very much Disturbed by the complete collapse of our social\n5:32\nsystem as we know it the failure of a political system\n5:37\nthe disabilities of our economic structure and the continual in danger to the\n5:46\npersonal life of the individual so out of this comes anxiety\n5:52\na continually increasing negative approach to circumstances\n5:59\ntoday there are probably more worriers than ever before in history\n6:04\nof course this is partly due to the fact there are more people than ever before in history\n6:10\nbut the percentage of Warriors is increasing every day this hardly a day go by in which\n6:17\nindividuals do not come face to face with what to them is solid proof\n6:24\nof the failure of their system of life this is something that is bound to cause\n6:30\nanxiety but we have to also realize that these happenings are not accidents\n6:38\nthe problems we Face are the problems we have caused and the fact that they were caused by\n6:45\nour ancestors and that we may lead them to our descendants these do not alter the basic fact that\n6:54\nman is the cause of his own trouble trying to work with this situation\n7:00\ntells us very simply that the only cure for the problems that man causes is that\n7:07\nman stopped causing them he must in some way change his own\n7:12\napproach to existence of course the first thing that comes to\n7:17\nmind with this idea is that we must elect someone to do this for us\n7:24\nwe must appoint someone to think for us and to have the authority to help other\n7:32\npeople to see the light and at the same time leave our private interests alone\n7:38\nthese must not be disturbed so we have today\n7:43\na tremendous desire for some heroic personality\n7:48\nwe would like to see the Skies open and the Holy Trinity take place as this is highly unlikely we are still\n7:57\nother problems and ways of approaching this situation admitting that we are living in the day\n8:04\nof the great headache the question is what are we going to do about it are we just simply going to\n8:11\nhave one headache after another as long as we live now headaches due to worry anxiety\n8:18\nmisunderstanding misinterpretation antagonisms of all kinds these headaches\n8:25\nunfortunately do not stay in the head they come out into other areas of Our\n8:31\nLives this headache that we have this Grand\n8:36\nhead problem that worries us is affecting every aspect of society\n8:43\nthe warrior is already on the way toward being sick\n8:48\nnow if worry was what was intended it would be unlikely that it would cause illness and be destructive to the human\n8:56\nbeing we must therefore assume that worry is not the answer worry is only a means of complicating\n9:03\nthe difficulty so the problem of going around worrying\n9:09\nfretting stewing fearing everything that happens mistrusting everyone\n9:15\nand in a state of Perpetual criticism this apparently is not the answer\n9:21\nthe proof of that is that it is solving nothing and making us sick\n9:27\ntherefore we should begin to think in terms of how to act so that we will not\n9:32\nbe sick the solution to the problem lies not only in our fears and anxieties but in\n9:40\nthe solution of the causes of these fears and anxieties\n9:45\nit is useless to assume that the rest of humanity will agree with us on any subject\n9:51\nin fact it's hardly worthwhile trying to convert other people for just as surely\n9:58\nas we are trying to convert them they are determined to convert US so it just goes on and on and on\n10:06\nthe only way we can stop worrying stop fearing stop hating\n10:11\nis to put a discipline upon ourselves we cannot prevent the world from\n10:17\nworrying but we can become detached from the worrying set\n10:24\nwe can become self-sufficient to our own needs\n10:29\nthis does not mean selfishness it does not mean that we are not mindful of the\n10:35\nproblems of other people it does not mean that we will not do everything possible to assist others in\n10:42\nthe solution of their problems but it means that before we help other people we must find an answer that will work\n10:50\nfor ourselves there is really no use in simply sharing the worries\n10:56\nthere is no use in trying to find new worries in everything that happens in\n11:01\nlife no man has been given a faculty that is\n11:07\nprobably unique in the world of nature he has memory\n11:13\na magnificent equipment that enables him to build his own\n11:18\nsolutions by remembrances of his own life history is collective memory biography\n11:26\nis individual memory and autobiography is the individual remembering the life\n11:32\nhe himself is living now from the most fundamental and basic\n11:38\nexperiences of his life he has been given the equipment to\n11:43\nestimate values weigh all things and cling to that which is good\n11:49\nin order to do these things he must shift his point of security\n11:55\neveryone wants security insecurity is the great measure of our time\n12:00\nit is the problem that we are all concerned with how can we find security\n12:07\nwell it's obvious that the various patterns we are now following\n12:13\nthese are not bringing security the individual today is trying to find\n12:20\nhis Securities where it is not where these Securities have no factual\n12:26\nexistence one of the most basic problems here is the emphasis upon wealth\n12:34\nmost people are still convinced that if they have enough money they are safe\n12:40\nof course the depend it much depends on what they do with the money if they take it to Las Vegas they're not\n12:47\nsafe also there are many Investments which are very tempting and will lead to loss\n12:53\nbut essentially the individual feels that if his income and his economic\n12:59\nstatus is secure he has nothing to worry about\n13:04\nfacts are against this conclusion for I've known a great many wealthy persons and probably most of you have\n13:11\nalso known many who are more than comfortably fixed who are worrying worse\n13:16\nthan anyone else they're worrying because their wealth has been destroying their children breaking down their homes\n13:23\nand making themselves sick So Physical Securities are not the\n13:29\nanswer physical security is good if it's available but as a goal as an answer to the\n13:37\nEternal problem it is a failure in the first place there is no way in\n13:42\nwhich everyone can be rich and as long as there are various levels\n13:48\nof Finance there will be conflict so money is not the answer to our\n13:53\nproblem of security the next possibility seems to be intelligence\n13:59\ncan we by some means or other think our way out of this dilemma\n14:04\ncan the Mind solve it well the mind has been producing Solutions since the dawn of time\n14:11\nbut these Solutions are interesting fascinating very tempting and can completely\n14:19\ntake over the life of a person but these Solutions are not Solutions\n14:25\nall the mentality that we've had in the world up to the present time has been unable to cope with war with crime or\n14:33\nwith poverty the Mind tries to find answers but every\n14:38\nanswer the Mind finds and tries to apply comes face to face with obstacles that\n14:45\nthe Mind cannot solve the truth of the matter is that the mind is an interesting fascinating bit of\n14:52\nequipment but it cannot correct the present existing circumstances\n14:58\nnow the mind has given us a wide area of Sciences and philosophies with which to\n15:05\ncope with life the mind is made possible science but science is not solving anything\n15:13\nscience gives us a cure for some minor ailment perhaps or even a major ailment\n15:18\nbut in so doing hands to the world mechanisms which could destroy the entire human race\n15:26\ncyan says a very great weakness and that weakness is the failure of humanitarianism in the scientific\n15:34\nprogram science is concerned with knowledge it is using the mind to advance its own\n15:41\npurposes but when it comes to taking care of the Widow and the fatherless science is not\n15:47\na great success other fields of learning the Arts are corrupted\n15:53\nall of the various elements of mental activity show problems\n15:59\nphilosophy in our generation is virtually non-existent what we call philosophy is a higher\n16:05\nintellectual materialism our modern philosophies are based not upon ideals but upon material\n16:13\ninstitutions we send our young people to the universities and they have the Mind\n16:19\nstrained they come back from the University and within a few years they're in trouble\n16:25\neven while they're in school they may be subjected to narcotics alcoholism and\n16:31\nother Corruptions therefore education has not been able to keep its own campus clean therefore\n16:38\nthere is some question about it being able to solve the problems of mankind\n16:43\nso individuals looking all directions to try to find some answer to this very\n16:49\npressing problem there's massive problems are rising from something\n16:55\nthat must have a solution in the individual man will never be confronted with the problem he cannot solve\n17:03\nbut he may be confronted with problems he will not solve because the solution Solutions are inconvenient\n17:10\ntherefore we can come now to the next issue in the problem what is there that\n17:16\nthe individual can cling to in this great stress of modern living\n17:21\nthe first natural answer to this is religion but religion also is at a very serious\n17:28\ndisadvantage religion presents us with abstract\n17:33\nvirtues religion provides us with a concept of\n17:39\nan invisible causal universe beyond our perceptions\n17:44\nit also populates this universe with beings invisible to us\n17:50\nand the whole situation sums up in a very simple thought namely that religion\n17:56\ndeals with things we cannot see and so-called materialism deals with\n18:03\nthings we can see perfectly possible to see the house we\n18:08\nare building it is perfectly possible to count the shares of stock that we own\n18:14\nbut it is not possible to actually factually estimate the nature of the\n18:21\nspiritual World in which we live this world is shut from us because we do\n18:28\nnot possess the extra sensory perceptions necessary to make an\n18:34\ninvisible spiritual cause of Life visible and tangible to our common\n18:39\neveryday living this place is all the advantage in the\n18:45\nhands of the materialist whatever he is doing you can see he can\n18:50\nsee the Laboratories produce these experiments so we have facts Gatherings all the time\n18:57\nmore and more facts and truths gradually disappearing\n19:04\nthis means that there is a conflict between invisible principles\n19:11\nand visible policies and as long as this conflict exists the\n19:18\nindividual is inevitably over influenced by the material policies\n19:24\nbecause he can see them because they are working in his life because they are directly the causes of\n19:31\nhis worries they become the great entanglement\n19:36\nwhereas the solution in principles and ideals this solution remains elusive intangible\n19:45\nand is greatly overlooked because it does not immediately prove itself to our\n19:52\nphysical perceptions so with this situation constantly\n19:58\nundermining our faith it is very easy to become more and more\n20:04\naddicted to worry and less and less supported by principles which we cannot actually see\n20:13\nthe result of course has been the gradual rise of a vast materialistic\n20:18\nculture in ancient times man looking for an answer to things\n20:24\nfound no answer in the society around him there was no safety in his own cave\n20:30\nnor it was their safety in his relations with those in the caves around him\n20:35\nhe was alone he was struggling against unknown factors and the material world was as yet an\n20:43\nunsolved mystery therefore because he knew very little about the physical Universe he still was\n20:50\nable to cling to the spiritual integrities of his tribal beliefs\n20:55\nas he knew more and more about the material world he became increasingly involved it\n21:04\nbecame a great mystery of Wonder it became a challenge and little by little\n21:09\nattention was focused upon physical circumstances\n21:15\nand the possibility of altering them the possibility of taking your neighbor's\n21:20\ncave and adding it to yours the possibility of accumulating wealth or\n21:26\ntaking it away from someone else who had accumulated it all these things came as\n21:31\nman's knowledge of material things increased and little by little religion was we\n21:40\nwill say transformed from a simple hope a simple statement of the reality of\n21:47\nthings above material that material existence little by little religion was\n21:53\ntheologized it was theologized in order that it might have a form or a shape a\n22:01\ndimension or a proportions that man could experience with his sensory perceptions\n22:07\nhe could not understand the Magnificent Divine Universal house\n22:12\nthe Magnificent Universe which was the symbol of the divine power\n22:18\nso so in order to make this invisible principle in some way tangible\n22:25\nMortals began to build great Cathedrals temples shrines mosques they began to\n22:32\ncreate visible symbols of the invisible truths and persons who could not grasp of the\n22:40\ninvisible principles gained gradually a sense of respect regard and admiration for the symbols of\n22:49\nthese principles the systems of faith that came into the world the person who could not even for a\n22:56\nmoment experience the divine presence felt something when he entered the\n23:02\ncathedral he found himself in the midst of a great Beauty a tremendous elevation of\n23:08\nConcepts and Consciousness he found himself surrounded by symbols of holy\n23:14\nliving and holy thinking and gradually these symbols brought him to his knees\n23:21\nhe became a willing to accept the invisible in the symbols which it had\n23:26\nprojected from itself and which man had fashioned as a means of protecting the\n23:32\nworship of the deity which was his hope of salvation\n23:38\nso by degrees religion became embodied it took upon\n23:44\nitself the shape and proportion of the world in which it functioned it was one great philosopher of the past\n23:52\nsaid there is there is but one God but he has been worshiped under 72 names\n24:00\nnow the 72 names began to get us into trouble also because people began to believe that\n24:07\neach name represented a different belief where the differences were largely those\n24:12\nof language and grammar and actually the same ideal abstract concept of deity was\n24:19\npresent in all religions the important point is that gradually the world was filled with sanctuaries of\n24:27\nfaith some still stand others are ruins some more will be built on and on a\n24:34\ncertain type of human being will gain the strength of worship\n24:40\nby beholding the houses of his deities we're holding the works of other Pious\n24:47\npeople as these works are exemplified in the stained glass windows and the mighty\n24:53\narches and spans of cathedrals churches and temples so we have the interesting phenomenon a\n25:02\nman trying to make invisible things visible and achieving to a degree\n25:09\nbut this degree isn't got him into another difficulties and these various institutions which he\n25:16\ncreated for the purpose of inwardly experiencing the Sublimity of God\n25:22\ngradually became involved in various theological complications\n25:27\nand these complications attempted to standardize men's beliefs to force them\n25:34\nto accept certain doctrines or policies regardless of their own internal\n25:40\nattitudes or concepts gradually therefore religion was\n25:46\ntransformed into Theology and the priests of antiquity became the theologians of later times\n25:53\nthese were individuals who were very largely dogmatic they served dogmatic\n25:59\nbeliefs they serve certain attitudes they held certain convictions as\n26:05\ninevitable and absolute and gradually this descended to the time of the\n26:13\nuniversal Reformation so to say the relate religious Rebellion which brought\n26:20\nan end to the Medieval World after the Reformation religions and\n26:26\nChristendom began to break up more and more individual theologies came\n26:31\ninto existence sect after sect rules each with its own peculiar Concepts and\n26:38\nbeliefs and these sects ever since have been locked to a great degree at least\n26:43\nin an intense competitiveness and in the infinite belief that they are right and\n26:50\nthat therefore others must Bend to them well this goes on until another\n26:56\nsomething came along and that was what we call the Age of Enlightenment the age\n27:01\nof humanism it was then gradually obvious that the public was resenting the dogmatics of\n27:08\nTheology and was therefore striving to liberate itself from the arbitrary\n27:14\ndoctrines which were supported only by theological institutions\n27:20\nthese doctrines gradually came into conflict with human interests and\n27:25\nattitudes as a result of this conflict we find finally the rise of Science and this at\n27:34\nthe definite basic antagonism that developed between science and religion\n27:39\nin all its forms these are various changes came to the individual and in the 20th century find\n27:47\nthe individual himself without any solid psychological religious spiritual or\n27:55\neven scientific support he comes into a world is dominated by\n28:01\nmillions of persons each with ideas of their own which cannot be reconciled with the ideas of anyone else\n28:07\ntherefore instead of having a solid Unity upon which to build something each\n28:12\nindividual is under the pressure of a common dissimilarity everyone is trying\n28:19\nto do his thing in his own way and very often at the expense of other\n28:25\npeople trying to do their things so here we are now in the closing years\n28:31\nof the 20th century and we are here with practically no\n28:37\nsolid foundation under anything we are searching for various integrities\n28:44\nand it has been obvious for a long time that science is not going to solve the\n28:50\nproblem of man's salvation if it is able to extend the length of life as it may hope to do it is only\n28:57\ngoing to give the individual more years in which to be miserable because it is not giving him any good reason for the\n29:05\nlife he has it is not making his life here useful happy Pleasant and constructive\n29:12\nit goes on helping him to physically survive but it does nothing to make his survival\n29:18\nimportant or to make his survival useful to anyone the idea that he is going to be\n29:24\nremembered by his descendants is a vanity in itself just as certainly as we do not at this time at least have any\n29:32\nparticular regard for our own ancestors it is all a problem of floating on the\n29:39\nsurface of a of an unsolved mystery and in this condition\n29:45\nmany persons just simply give up they just see no longer any reason for\n29:52\nanything yet within themselves they have the faculties necessary to discover the\n29:58\nreasons for almost everything but because of the traditional attitudes\n30:04\nbecause of the limitations of our educational system and the Corruptions of our economic and political structures\n30:11\nthe individual has no moral support to try and improve himself\n30:17\nhe feels that the only thing he can gain by going against the system is to end up\n30:23\nunemployed he does not find any solution to the\n30:29\nneeds of his own inner life there are things he would like to do\n30:34\nbut when he is actually given an opportunity to live according to the convictions he can't claims to have\n30:41\nthese convictions don't fall apart he says he would live better under better circumstances but up to now there\n30:50\nhave never been any circumstances sufficiently good to make the individual Live Well he thinks he's going to he thinks if his\n30:58\nworries are taken from him he'll be happy so he has some of them taken from him and now he's worrying because he hasn't\n31:05\ngot the worries that's frightening him he thinks he must be failing in some way\n31:10\nif he doesn't realize the seriousness of the situation all these uh problems sort of gang up on\n31:19\npeople they are not really prepared to handle them they've had no background of training\n31:25\nthe education they have is virtually useful only to make a living not to make\n31:31\na life actually we need a complete shakeup of the entire system\n31:38\nbut when we think of shake up we think of Anarchy we think of some desperatism\n31:43\ntaking over destroying our freedom and forcing us into a state of discipline of\n31:49\nsome kind then we realize that this is also motivated by materialistic\n31:55\nambitions we are not in a position to solve most of these situations\n32:01\nnow with one thing we have to learn to do and that is to accept the complication\n32:08\nas it is we must stop dramatizing and emotionalizing it we must simply say\n32:16\nthis is it this is the way it is and in all probabilities in most ways it\n32:25\nis going to stay this way for a while and it's going to probably stay here this way as long as we live\n32:32\ntherefore we are going to be born into confusion we're going to struggle with it for our period of embodiment and\n32:40\nwe're going to leave the confusion behind when we go we are not going to change all these\n32:45\nthings instantly no matter how hard we try the we have our troubles in common but\n32:53\nour Solutions must be individuals the only way we can face this complex is\n33:00\nto gradually work out in ourselves an explanation of it a reason for it that\n33:06\nis sufficiently strong to enable us to live reasonably well and at the same\n33:12\nsame time have a strong living realization of spiritual integrities\n33:18\nnow this sounds very like a very difficult thing but after all this new world in which we\n33:25\nlive is an Amphitheater of natural phenomena we are here in a world in which\n33:31\neverything is lawful or unlawful everything is cataloged classified and\n33:38\ncontrolled while we cannot for the moment perhaps see the hand of God in the things that\n33:45\nhappen we do know that there are universal laws that are immutable we also know that in nature there are\n33:54\nprinciples which prove Beyond any doubt that a universal system does exist\n34:00\nand that this system has the means the knowledge the Consciousness the reality\n34:07\nto survive all of man's difficulties and also to transcend man's intentions to\n34:16\ndestroy the system of which he is apart this system cannot be destroyed by man\n34:23\nthis problem having been more or less sensed as we have to sense it we then\n34:29\ncan say to ourselves we're in a mess why how are we going to get out of this mess\n34:36\nhow are we going to achieve the things that are necessary are we going to achieve it by becoming\n34:45\ncompletely Disturbed discouraged and becoming alcoholics are we going to get any solution to\n34:51\nanything by narcotics are we going to make our world better for ourselves and other people by simply\n34:59\nwalking out into the Wilderness somewhere and leaving everything else behind can we fulfill our destiny by taking\n35:06\nholy orders and Vanishing into a religious retreat can we actually accomplish anything by\n35:13\nwalking up and down the street with a banner condemning other people we have all these attitudes\n35:20\nbut none of them actually does anything to solve the problems of Our Lives\n35:27\ntoday we have more groups that are in activistic relationship with others that\n35:34\nare constantly parading that are constantly objecting and yet out of it all comes nothing but\n35:40\na great headache why because this is not the answer it is not the way we were intended to do it\n35:47\nuntil we get down to facts and realize what is necessary there will be no\n35:52\nanswer and when we get to the point where we appreciate the answer we realize that\n35:58\nall the misery we've had was well worthwhile that it was the only way that nature\n36:04\ncould educate a wayward creation that is the only way that nature can\n36:09\nbring back to the prodigal children that it fashioned into realization of its\n36:15\nwisdom and its love is to allow these children to get either problems they\n36:20\ncannot endure any longer and to discover for once and for all that they cannot solve problems that are\n36:27\ngreater than themselves if this begins to sort of trickle into\n36:33\nour consciousness then we begin to have the foundation not\n36:39\na final solution but a foundation that will enable us to live the days of our\n36:45\nyears in a comparative state of acceptance\n36:50\nnot a not a an acceptance of the way things are\n36:55\ndoubt but an acceptance of the necessity that mankind must pass through certain\n37:01\nexperiences to outgrow his own ignorance the individual therefore can reach a\n37:09\npoint in which he can live from day to day observing reflecting thinking\n37:15\nfeeling studying doing everything he possibly can to understand the reason\n37:21\nfor the situations as they are now and if he becomes more and more\n37:26\nconcerned in finding reasons he will gradually rescue his mental and emotional complex from futility from the\n37:34\nbelief that everything is wrong that there's no solution to anything and that he was born simply to suffer and die\n37:41\nhe does not have to have these negative thoughts what he has to do instead of\n37:47\ngiving up in despair is accepting the challenge of personal change\n37:53\nhe must make certain adjustments in himself he was gradually released his energies\n37:59\nfrom Despair and despondency and focused them upon the understanding of life\n38:06\nthe understanding of the way things must be in the way they should be and they will they will be regardless of what man\n38:13\ndoes if we can get to understand therefore that we are being disciplined\n38:21\nthat the individual is being encouraged to correct his own mistakes and stop\n38:27\nmaking other similar mistakes he will then perhaps have more energy for a solution there's a lot of work to\n38:35\nbe done in this world there is a great need of United effort but nearly always\n38:41\ndespondency Neurosis pessimism all of these negative attitudes impoverish the\n38:49\nresources of the person himself when he finally centers his mind upon\n38:55\nfutility he will find it everywhere he will become more and more futile in\n39:02\neverything that he does he will become discouraged he will believe firmly that this world is of no\n39:08\nvalue and he begins despondent enough he may even contemplate suicide\n39:14\nbut with all this contemplation and all this negation nothing has been accomplished except the disintegration\n39:21\nof a personal existence taking this point as a basis then of\n39:28\nsomething to do that is at a different point of activity the individual should\n39:35\nbegin to try to observe the working of universal law in the various occurrences\n39:42\nof his life he must begin to see reasons for things which he now regards as merely miseries\n39:50\nhe must begin to realize that he lives in a world of lawful procedures and that\n39:57\nhe must abide by them now on some levels we're beginning to get a little wiser\n40:03\nbut up as to now it hasn't been considered a general Improvement\n40:08\none of the fields in which we seem to be getting a little smarter at least is\n40:13\nnutrition we have discovered finally what we should have known always but which we\n40:20\ndidn't need to know until we broke the rules namely that nutrition is a very\n40:27\nimportant factor in life that it cannot be ignored that the individual who\n40:33\nwishes to have better health must concentrate his attention upon learning\n40:39\nhow to have better health he will study the problems of nutrition\n40:44\nin himself he must discover his own mistakes due to appetites he must\n40:51\ndiscover why he cannot do just what he pleases and at the same time maintain\n40:57\nbodily health so here we'll come face to face with facts and we're gradually beginning to\n41:03\nface them with more or less conscious intelligence now our out our mental life is also in\n41:11\nconstant need of nutritional education what we take into the mind\n41:17\nas a phase of our nutritional problem if we take in the wrong thoughts we're\n41:24\ngoing to be just as bad off mentally and physically as we would be if we eat food that is\n41:31\nimproper to our needs the individual can be allergic to attitudes and everyone more or less\n41:39\nis allergic to negative thinking it will never help him and it will\n41:45\nalmost certainly hurt him now this doesn't mean he won't live through it he may have negative thoughts\n41:51\nall his life and pass the century mark but he will simply have extended the period of disappointments\n41:57\ndisillusionments and disasters for himself therefore with Nutrition a very fact\n42:04\nfactual thing the individual has a mental life that needs to be disciplined\n42:11\nand needs to be subject to the laws of mental nutrition\n42:17\nhe breaks these laws every day in front of his television or he breaks in every\n42:22\nday in the various activities which he considers essential he takes in a constant stream of bad\n42:31\nfood he takes in food that is not only indigestible but in many cases it is\n42:39\nhopelessly poisonous he does the same thing mentally and\n42:45\nphysically if he takes in contaminated mental food he is going to be safe\n42:50\nand most of the mental conditions of our society lead to a problem of\n42:56\ncontaminated thinking you know the person doesn't have to take this on\n43:02\nhe can live in the midst of it but he does not have to become contaminated there's no law that says that it has\n43:10\nbeen absolutely necessary inevitable or irrevocable that an individual has to\n43:16\nbecome an alcoholic there is no reason given by heaven or Earth why an alcoholic has to drive a\n43:23\ncar under the influence of alcohol these are things we do ourselves\n43:28\nand our worries are just as futile and useless as these other habits\n43:35\nwe have no law that says we have to be frightened\n43:40\nwe now have no law that says that we have to have a world that does what we\n43:46\nplease it to do or otherwise we will be miserable there is no law that says we have to be\n43:53\nhappily married or have pleasant relatives or obedient children these\n43:59\nfactors do not exist as inevitable necessities therefore we cannot resent or reject the\n44:07\nopposite when it comes along but every one of these relationship has\n44:12\nlessons everything has something to learn we are not only indebted to our families\n44:20\nfor a great deal of valuable knowledge but our children are indebted to us for inevitable truths all these things are\n44:29\ncommon necessities of life we can reject them we can allow Prejudice and criticism and\n44:37\ncondemnation to destroy all of the integrities of relationships but this is not because it\n44:44\nis necessary it is because we have chosen to do it that way\n44:50\nwe have had our personal conceits rebuked in some way and we can never\n44:55\nforgive the person who did it our relatives do not do what we expect them to therefore we won't speak to them\n45:02\nagain it all lies in our own situation none of the problems that face Us in in\n45:10\nour personal lives can remain completely unchanged if we\n45:17\ndetermine to change them there are responsibilities which we may\n45:22\nnot be able to dispose of but we can transmute them into opportunities\n45:28\nwe can do anything we want with the problems of the day if we will\n45:34\nplace inside of ourselves ourselves a major Rod a ruler by means of which we\n45:43\ncan measure the things that happen in daily life one of the situations that we all have\n45:51\nto face today is on unemployment and all of the relations to it we have to\n45:58\nsometimes give up many luxuries that we have come to consider to be this indispensable\n46:04\nmany persons are unable to give up anything without falling apart yet these same persons when they pass on\n46:11\nmust give up everything and do nothing more than accept the fact\n46:16\neverything in life can be understood reevaluated and accommodated to if we\n46:26\nreally wish to make the effort therefore if we are good Warriors as\n46:32\nmost people are these days we should take some of these worries and see what we can do about them to see how we can\n46:39\nchange our own thinking our own relation to them and recognize that a problem is\n46:46\na challenge not a disaster now we cannot always make us all the\n46:52\nproblem but the moment we come against a problem we can't solve\n46:57\nThis is highly educational in itself the fact that we can't solve some common\n47:04\nhuman problem may just be a proof of that we are not infallible\n47:10\nwhich is a discouraging Discovery to make because we wish to assume that whatever\n47:15\nis necessary we know it whatever we should be doing we do it\n47:21\nand he'll suddenly wake up and find that we are not getting anywhere with our own\n47:26\ninfallibility can be one of the most important lessons that we will ever learn in this world it suddenly gives us\n47:33\nthe opportunity to recognize that what we consider to be the proof of our\n47:40\nwisdom is merely perhaps only the pressure of our own egos determining\n47:45\nwhat we're going to do so we can begin to find out for instance\n47:50\nthat our advice isn't always good if our advice isn't good why\n47:56\nis it because we've had no opportunity to learn is it that our own lives have in so\n48:03\ninstituted that we are giving advice based entirely upon personal experience\n48:09\nwhat is the reason why our advice is worthless Our advice is usually worthless because\n48:16\nwe have not actually learned any of the lessons of life that would make our\n48:21\nadvice significant the individual who has suffered much and\n48:26\ncome through it and can give advice the individual who has suffered little and\n48:32\nis sorry for himself all his life has very little to contribute to human problems\n48:37\nso it's a matter of gradually gaining an integration within yourself\n48:44\nand this integration begins with one basic conviction for the universe is right\n48:50\nthe things that happen happen because they must happen and it must happen because the law of\n48:57\ncause and effect is immutable and yet this law never was and never\n49:02\nwill be a tyrant the law is not something that is punishing you unjustly or taking away\n49:08\nfrom you things you deserve the law of cause and effect is reminding\n49:13\nyou whatever that you want in life that is worthwhile you have to deserve\n49:20\nyou have to earn happiness you have to earn security\n49:25\nnot in the terms of a business venture but in terms of internal acceptance of\n49:30\nvalue we all come into this world with really with nothing\n49:36\nwe even have a body that for a long time is much help to us we live a while four school years\n49:42\nperhaps if we're lucky and then we leave this world and we leave it with nothing at all except what we have developed\n49:51\nwithin our own consciousness if there's anything that survives it's the soul and the inner life enriched by\n49:59\ngood works and by understanding and insight other things are useless\n50:05\nif we die of a broken heart because we can't take physical wealth with us we\n50:10\nare really at a very impoverished condition and if we leave great wealth to our descendants we are likely to be\n50:16\ndoing them a great harm so nature in its own quiet way\n50:22\ncan give us the Securities we need let's look around ourselves for a while\n50:28\nand in other people try to see the consequences of attitudes\n50:34\ntry to see who among the people we know is perhaps the most happy\n50:40\nif we know one individual or two or three individuals who out of a good lifetime of years and experience are\n50:48\nstill strong in faith who still are able to rise above the\n50:54\nemergencies of living for later years face the future with peace and calm of spirit\n51:01\nwhat have these people that we do not have and we'll generally find out that it is\n51:08\na disposition that is based upon constructive reactions to circumstances\n51:15\nthese people are not the ones who never suffered but these are the persons to whom\n51:20\nsuffering was a maturing power for power not a rotting one\n51:26\nwe will also find that most of the people who are happy in this world are\n51:31\nsatisfied with little cherish the things that they do enjoy\n51:37\nwith great quiet dudes with patience with understanding with gratitude\n51:44\nthese people are grateful for small mercies we are ungrateful with great blessings\n51:51\ntherefore our lives are not as theirs are as the years go on\n51:57\nwe can find in this world a great many persons whose conditions are no better\n52:03\nthan our own but whose attitudes are remarkably better and this gives us the realization that\n52:10\nours can be bettered also we are not born pessimists we have to\n52:16\ntrain ourselves to be a pessimist we have to gradually eliminate our life from our lives everything that is good\n52:23\nand we almost always have to blame someone else for the tragedy because very few people want to accept\n52:29\nthe fact that they are wrecking their own lives so out of a little thoughtfulness comes\n52:36\nthe possibility of the person gaining a stability in this period of stress which\n52:43\nis the thing we all want much concerned with and we will find ultimately that no\n52:48\nchange in our outward circumstances will produce this stability\n52:54\nwe can move into a smaller house it may help we can move into a larger one which will\n53:00\ngratify certain Ambitions and bring with it more responsibilities than we can carry\n53:05\nwe can do all kinds of physical things trying to find that peace that the world\n53:11\nis seeking but it will still be elusive because everything that is physical is\n53:17\ntransitory and the only thing that is not transitory in man is his own soul\n53:22\nand this is the thing which he must educate he must release in the manifestation and he must serve with\n53:30\nfullness of heart and mind so if you finally decide to do something\n53:35\nabout it begin the cultivation of constructive living and thinking\n53:42\nlet the mind be concerned with something that is not worldly\n53:48\nnow many things have come along that people have found to be very helpful in\n53:54\nthe studying of their emotional lives service to other people is a\n54:00\ntremendously remedying factor to forget our own needs our own wishes our own\n54:06\ndesires to help persons less fortunate than ourselves has one great virtue it\n54:13\ntakes our minds off of ourselves and it is the individual with his mind\n54:18\nlocked on himself who is in the deepest trouble then there are all kinds of constructive\n54:24\nattitudes the individual can begin educating his life and in most persons the education of his\n54:31\nlife will involve and must involve some religious insights\n54:37\nnow religion is a very personal thing religion is a relationship between the\n54:42\nindividual and the divine power behind and within himself when it is viewed this way it is called\n54:49\nmysticism for mysticism is the belief in the immediate possibility of direct\n54:54\ncontact with the divine it does not require intermediaries he\n55:00\ndoes not require that the individual will follow the concepts or traditions of other persons it means that through\n55:07\nthe natural expression of internal integrities the individual penetrates\n55:13\ninto the core of himself and receives virtue and refreshment from that power\n55:19\nwhich lies at the root of his own nature this means of course that uh the calming\n55:26\nof the Mind is of the greatest importance the individual who is constantly\n55:32\nagitating His Thoughts with negative attitudes is not going to have this calmness\n55:38\nbut quiet dudes which was of course the basic religious concept of what were\n55:44\ncalled the quietest which included the friends and the Quakers and a number of Oriental sects this quietude\n55:52\nin an expression of the term be still and know that I am God\n55:58\nwho instead of worrying the Stillness helps Stillness is not an escape from worry\n56:05\nit is an internal realization that there is something deeper more\n56:11\nvaluable more useful and more beneficial than worried it is worrying that is locking us away\n56:18\nfrom our own inner lives all the criticism and condemnation and\n56:24\nirritation no matter how much we believe it to be deserved is simply cutting out our own internal\n56:32\nexperience the more we fix upon outside problems\n56:37\nthe less time and energy we have to release internal strength\n56:44\nso the one of the simplest things that the warrior can try to do if he is of\n56:49\nSoul minded is to take on interests that break in on the worry pattern doing\n56:55\nthings that are maybe not important physically but are very important as\n57:01\nrelease of understanding and insight the studies of arts and crafts the\n57:06\nexperience of doing things with the hands is very these are very valuable to\n57:11\nthe person whose mind is troubled all the time the individual cannot divide his\n57:18\nenergies equally on two different levels simultaneously therefore if you can't do anything\n57:24\nbetter where the times get pressure full just sit back quietly and knit\n57:29\nanything to use a power to separate the person\n57:35\nfrom negative thinking if you have to keep your mind on something else\n57:42\nthis helps poetry is of a good nature is a great help in these uh Pursuits a very\n57:50\nfine inspirational literature can help not necessarily have highly Advanced\n57:55\nintellectual study of the universe but simply gentle quietude\n58:01\nstorms that reach into the heart of things they bring gentle messages of\n58:06\npeace and Contrition to the tired person but whatever it is gradually educate\n58:12\nyour mind until you are able to tell it I want you to see the good in things\n58:18\nI want you to observe progress and seeing the good in things we do not\n58:25\nwant the mind to find good in the things that have never been any good we do not want the mind to go back to\n58:32\nits old habits to see the good in things for the average person is to realize\n58:38\nthat an experience is Meaningful and that out of the things that happen we grow\n58:45\na misfortune is not a blight upon us but a challenge Upon Our resources\n58:52\nto accept the challenge of growth we must avoid the tendency to try to\n58:58\nescape growth by economic means or by travel or by change which has no direct bearing upon\n59:06\nthe facts if you can achieve a certain amount of Peace within your own nature you can\n59:13\nthen begin to re-educate yourself it may take some time because you may not be\n59:18\nable to just re-educate everything at once because you may have to re-educate\n59:24\nyour background back three or four generations to get at the root of some of it your families have been made up of\n59:31\nWarriors everyone has struggled for something that he either didn't get or lost afterwards or perhaps even more\n59:39\noften got it and no longer wanted it these things you have to work out in\n59:44\nyour own life in childhood in education in marriage in relationship with life business children and everything we have\n59:52\nbeen taught to be concerned in the sense of being irritated\n59:57\nwe have been taught to be critical we have been taught to dislike rather than\n1:00:03\naccept the major occurrences of existence we consider change a disaster when no\n1:00:11\nchange can be the worst disaster of all so with these Concepts basically working\n1:00:17\nin US we must try for the beginning of security and that is a quiet\n1:00:25\nperspective relationship with life when something happens that for the last 50\n1:00:31\nyears has caused us to be angry it's not the best thing to do is to take\n1:00:36\na deep breath relax and keep quiet instead of answering back and starting\n1:00:41\nan argument that might go far enough to break a home just say nothing\n1:00:46\nvery quietly let the thing die without adding anything to it\n1:00:52\ntry never to put salt into an open wound never try to argue faster or better than\n1:01:01\nsomebody else that is how Wars are made are people out arguing each other\n1:01:07\nnations out arguing each other each one certain that its ideas are the best and\n1:01:13\nthe other one is wrong so under doubt be still\n1:01:18\nand in the being of Stillness and in the quietude of a complete detachment\n1:01:25\ntry to understand what is really meant what is all involved in this entire\n1:01:30\nproblem who is right who is wrong what is the meaning of the occurrence itself\n1:01:37\nlittle by little if you do it this way things become symbols of value\n1:01:44\ninstead of symbols of loss by degrees the individual can gain great\n1:01:51\ninsights from the quiet acceptance of life he can also observe the\n1:01:57\nconsequences come to people who are not self-controlled you can see how the\n1:02:02\nargument leads to another tragedy you can see how people walk out on each other over trivia and why children leave\n1:02:10\nhome and get into drift difficulties and perhaps ruin their lives\n1:02:15\nnow each person in his own way thinks that somebody else's fault that these\n1:02:21\nare ungrateful children that these are children who do not appreciate values and securities but the person then says\n1:02:29\nwhat securities did I give them did I give them three meals a day send\n1:02:34\nthem to school and start them off did I give them any moral or\n1:02:40\nphilosophical insight did I simply scold them when they didn't do what I expected them to or if they\n1:02:47\nhad a fault of some kind did I punish them was there anything in my relationship with these children to inspire them to\n1:02:55\nsearch within themselves for greater values did I give them a spiritual Foundation\n1:03:00\nof integrities did I prove to them through my own conduct that my security was based upon\n1:03:07\nintegrity if all of these or most of these things were lacking the mere fact that we\n1:03:14\nsupplied them with all the physical necessities of life still leaves us with a tremendous unmet\n1:03:21\nresponsibility and this is true in almost every Walk of Life that we in we bring people things\n1:03:28\nbut we do not help them to establish foundations that will endure\n1:03:35\nthe day we are looking perhaps isn't not for some time in the past for a better\n1:03:41\nreligious values all around we have finding new groups of\n1:03:46\npeople and old groups also that are beginning to come back to Faith\n1:03:52\nnow some of these uh in some of these countries where religion is in trouble particular trouble\n1:03:59\nthe faith itself is a tremendous Factor even though politically these countries\n1:04:05\nmay not be allowed full religious freedoms they cannot be taken away from\n1:04:11\nthe individual's internal life there is no degree of persecution\n1:04:18\nthat can prevent the individual from his internal acceptance of realities\n1:04:24\nhe may not be able to expound them to other people if he tries to preach them he may find\n1:04:30\nhimself in prison or in worse situation but there is no reason in the world and\n1:04:36\nno power on Earth that can prevent the individual from living on a level of personal integrities\n1:04:44\nhe can do whatever is the unpleasant task but he can do it with an\n1:04:50\nunderstanding of why and that out of persecution out of all\n1:04:55\nof the difficulties they've reset him he is gaining the strength to stand about\n1:05:01\nall of the problems that he has previously considered insurmountable\n1:05:07\nso we know that it does work another thing that is very important in\n1:05:12\nthis problem is to maintain some type of regular religious\n1:05:21\nrelationship with life and most of the time we attribute this\n1:05:26\nto church Gathering we think that the individual should join the church should attend services and\n1:05:33\nperhaps send children to the Sunday School but this is again a physical\n1:05:39\nsolution to a mystical problem I think every churchgoer should give\n1:05:45\ngreat thought so how he acts on the six days a week that he doesn't go to church\n1:05:52\nthis is the problem is he able to gradually maintain a\n1:05:58\nhigher level of religious Integrity in his daily happenings is he able to live every day of his life\n1:06:06\nsome principle that he has learned from his religion\n1:06:11\nis he setting an example to other members of his family is he doing the\n1:06:16\nthings that prove the sincerity of his religious commitment the commitment that simply is fulfilled\n1:06:24\nby a donation or fulfilled by attendance and public worship is not enough\n1:06:30\nit is something else entirely it is the individual's own internal uh acceptance\n1:06:38\nof a Divine principle now unfortunately most of our principal religions of today\n1:06:45\ndo not give adequate training on what constitutes the real objects of religion\n1:06:52\nuh many religions simply tell us that we should fear God others that we should love God\n1:07:00\nbut both of these terms are extremely abstract they're very hard to understand\n1:07:07\nbut we all have to understand every day is that religion all real religion of\n1:07:13\nevery denomination is a way of conduct and it's the conduct is inconsistent\n1:07:19\nwith the Creed the situation is out of order therefore religion in all matters is to\n1:07:26\nhave a constructive relationship with life religion is the power of the individual\n1:07:33\nto see God or good in the occurrences of his daily existence\n1:07:40\nit is necessary for the person if he is truly religious to become very grateful\n1:07:48\nfor the Privileges that are given to him in life instead of constantly beseeching deity\n1:07:54\nto take from him the proper responsibilities which are his own religion is better a veneration\n1:08:01\nacceptance and service of that which is known to be superior\n1:08:07\ntherefore gratitude for the Divine privileges is more important than\n1:08:13\nfussing over the human emergencies we are here by a wonderful rule a law\n1:08:20\nthat has gone on for millions of years we are the product of life that has been\n1:08:26\nunfolding for con counted millennia we are here because we are unfolding a\n1:08:33\nDivine spark within ourselves every noble beautiful and wonderful deed\n1:08:39\nthat we perform is part of a release of the Eternal God within us every bit of\n1:08:46\ncomplaint locks that God further into darkness the individual who does not see\n1:08:52\nGod in which what is happening to him will not find deity at all and deity is a presence challenging it\n1:09:01\nis causing the individual to call upon his spiritual resources if he believes\n1:09:07\nin peace religion calls upon him to keep the peace if he believes in integrities\n1:09:14\nreligion demands that he lives them every day now of course sometimes it appears to be\n1:09:21\nmartyrdom but for the most part we can still do a great deal more than we have\n1:09:27\ndone and our first emotion in life should not be a criticism of other people or\n1:09:34\ncriticism of circumstances but gratitude for the privilege of learning the\n1:09:40\nprivilege of being here to face problems and solve them the problem and privilege to live above\n1:09:47\ndisasters and catastrophes and finally to recognize the divine power and the\n1:09:53\ninfinite love that rules all things the most most critics have just\n1:09:58\nforgotten that deity is love they have forgotten that the things they don't like are practical evidence of\n1:10:06\ndivine love if the if the Divine Spirit was not all\n1:10:12\nloving as well as always it would permit individuals to make mistakes On and On\n1:10:18\nThrough the Ages until they completely eliminated themselves it would enable all that is evil to\n1:10:24\nTriumph forever all that the selfishness and littleness of the human being would\n1:10:29\nbecome the standard of all relationships this is not true actually that which loveth most is that\n1:10:37\nwhich chastise it that which finds ways to correct mistakes before they become\n1:10:44\nimpossible so as you start out in the day or in any\n1:10:50\npart of your life with a negative attitude on things with a kind of a glum look and with a quite definite certainty\n1:10:58\nthat everything is going to the dogs it is much better to be quiet and try to\n1:11:03\nsay where is the lesson where is the truth in this thing what is it that I can do\n1:11:10\nto make sure that my faith is stronger than the emergencies of living\n1:11:17\nhow can the individual prove to himself that his inner resources can carry him\n1:11:23\nthrough any emergency that arises in his life there are no emergencies really sickness\n1:11:30\ndeath and not emergencies that which is an emergency is when an\n1:11:36\nindividual makes a bad decision this is an emergency it is because he has\n1:11:41\nforgotten the principles upon which his life should be built built all the things natural and not emergencies\n1:11:48\nit is not an emergency that we grow older it is not emergency that we have to give\n1:11:55\nup certain Privileges and opportunities as years go by everything is that as we grow older we\n1:12:02\nhave the right to live according to a longer perspective of experience\n1:12:08\nwe can make decisions that the young have not yet the power to make but in\n1:12:13\nevery part of life youth age all periods we are living within a pattern of Divine\n1:12:19\nPurpose if we can get this thought sort of fixed in our minds we will not be so\n1:12:25\ngiven to all the worries and excitements that come along\n1:12:31\nwe are worried today over economics we always will be and always have been as long as we worship economics as long as\n1:12:38\nyou make the dollar deity we are going to be out worshiping the golden calf and we will be always in trouble\n1:12:46\nif we make our life built upon achievement in the same expense of\n1:12:51\nambition and this ambition causes us to be untrue or unkind or unreasonable\n1:12:57\nwe may attain the ambition and at the same time have a stroke or a coronary\n1:13:03\nbecause nature doesn't want it that way nature doesn't want the individual to\n1:13:08\nlive for ambition alone he won't seem to live individual to have a little\n1:13:13\nambition and a great deal of aspiration this is much better aspiration means to\n1:13:19\nbecome more ambition means to accumulate more and the more we become the less\n1:13:25\ndependent we become a fun accumulation until it is no longer a serious\n1:13:31\nemergency with us then there are persons who cannot live or cannot believe they are happy unless\n1:13:38\nthey are dominating somebody else the anyone whom we dominate we must\n1:13:43\naccept the consequences of our own domination of them we must take upon ourselves the karma\n1:13:50\nthat we have imposed upon other people by trying to live their lives for them and this is especially true if in trying\n1:13:58\nto live our their lives we are simply demanding that they accept our mistakes\n1:14:04\nlittle by little we have to learn all these principles they add up to a quite\n1:14:10\nkindly thoughtful relationship a relationship in which we are here to\n1:14:16\nbecome more and more aware of the infinite good in which we exist a good\n1:14:23\nwhich we are spoiling and dispoiling ourselves a good which we were forbidding to have\n1:14:30\nhappened because of the fact of our personal Ambitions and attitudes\n1:14:37\nas long as the individual lives as a rugged individual he will end up as a\n1:14:43\nragged individual there is no other way as long as we put a career ahead of\n1:14:49\neverything else and consider success in terms of monopolistic achievements\n1:14:56\nwe are breaking the rules and if we break the rules long enough the rules will break us\n1:15:03\nthere is no way in which we can do right and spell there's no way in which we can\n1:15:09\ndo wrong and succeed in this emergency of the 20th century\n1:15:16\nultimately the thing that is going to happen has to happen is that the Tower of Babel that we ourselves have built is\n1:15:23\ngoing to fall down but this does not mean it will carry us to Oblivion in one terrible experience\n1:15:30\nit simply means that the individual will be faced with restoring or\n1:15:36\nreconstructing a world which he has has destroyed or devastated by his own false\n1:15:43\nattitudes suppose you have been an alcoholic for 20 years and suddenly decide to get over it\n1:15:50\nnow he's going to take an awful lot of willpower to do it it is also going to take considerable personal suffering and\n1:15:58\nit may be that you'll have to be hospitalized for some sometime to get rid of the pressure of this destructive\n1:16:04\nhabit now the world so to say is an alcoholic and that can be more literal than we\n1:16:10\nmight think because alcoholism is a blight upon the whole surface of the Earth\n1:16:16\nbut also alcoholism is a symbol of a way of life it is a habit forming symbol of man's\n1:16:24\nselfishness it is part of a grand pattern in which everything we have done everything we\n1:16:31\nhave thought about everything we have lived for has been dominated by self-interest it has been dominated not by the law of\n1:16:38\nwhat we should do but the law of what we want to do and will do regardless of consequences the only part about it\n1:16:45\nthat's uncomfortable is the consequences but they are there and they always will be there and no one will ever be able to\n1:16:52\nget rid of them so we are if we are in a badly habit if\n1:16:58\nour world for several thousand years have been doing it wrong this will never for one moment change\n1:17:03\nthe fact that it is wrong there's no possible way in which we can cultivate so many vices that anyone or\n1:17:11\nall of them can become virtues if the trouble stays the same\n1:17:16\nnothing changes no matter how much legislation we make how many rules we make or how many of our contemporaries\n1:17:23\nmake the same mistakes the mistake is a mistake to Infinity it will never be changed the only way to\n1:17:31\nget over the mistake is to correct it now with this type of thinking we can\n1:17:37\nsort of relax a little bit I think we can do it from day to day trying to\n1:17:42\nbe what we were supposed to be kindly well-intentioned\n1:17:48\nhumanitarian persons with as much Mutual affection for each other as is possible\n1:17:54\nfor those who know very little about each other but to kindliness and fraternity and\n1:18:00\ncooperation to a constant searching for something that is truly better\n1:18:06\nand realizing that the successful life is a life dedicated to service and not\n1:18:12\ngetting dedicated to accumulation as we go along like that we can smooth\n1:18:17\nout a lot of this worry fear all this hatred all this uh struggle\n1:18:24\nwhich means people come by the thousands to seek help from Physicians mentalists\n1:18:31\npsychiatrists and all types of Healers simply because they cannot live with\n1:18:36\nthemselves they have allowed their personal feelings to make them so sick that they\n1:18:42\nare on the verge of a complete psychological disintegration now there's nothing out of those people\n1:18:49\nexcept their own minds if they can change their attitudes and their thinking they can be just as happy\n1:18:56\nas they are now miserable they can be much wiser also because they will\n1:19:01\ndiscover that the causes of misery are their own mistakes they stop making the mistakes they will\n1:19:08\nbe happy not happy may be in the sense of the of riotous living not happy in a sense of\n1:19:15\ngoing out and expending fortunes on luxuries but happy in a quiet peaceful\n1:19:21\nrelationship itself happiness which is the happiness of the normal person regardless of his economic\n1:19:28\nestate a happiness that comes from good work from being busy from doing our share of\n1:19:33\nthe world's labor for doing honest measure for whatever we are remunerated\n1:19:39\nand doing everything as nearly as we can as we would like to believe that God\n1:19:45\nwants it done that we will try always to keep not only the laws of man but the laws behind the\n1:19:54\nlaws the Eternal laws that never change if we can do this I think we can find a\n1:20:00\ncertain amount of strength over whatever has going to happen what we do what we are not aware of we\n1:20:08\ncan't plan for exactly but if everything we know today is Swept\n1:20:14\nAway we lose really nothing because actually one moment of the heart\n1:20:20\nstopped and we've lost it all anyway therefore nothing of a material nature\n1:20:26\nis permanent whether we lose it now or on the death day makes very little essential\n1:20:31\ndifference the league the thing that makes the real difference is whether while we are living we can\n1:20:38\nuse things without abusing them that we can have or not have and regardless of\n1:20:45\nour material estate keep Faith with principles upon which the world's survival depends\n1:20:51\nit's always therefore not much use to get all worked up over things rather it\n1:20:57\nis better to prove that we are good Christian people that we are good religious people that we are devouting\n1:21:04\nour insights and dedications by living a quiet life and shedding and\n1:21:11\nspreading around us only confidence that whatever person we meet we will not\n1:21:16\nbuild up their negative thinking but will encourage them as far as we can to\n1:21:22\nfind the truth behind their own actions we may not succeed but at least we will\n1:21:28\nnot build up their troubles by adding more negative thinking to theirs\n1:21:34\nis they have to live only with their own negative thinking it's bad enough but if they have to live with our pile of it\n1:21:40\nthat we put on them it's still worse so the best thing to do is to try always\n1:21:45\nto be peaceful and constructive and find the good in the thing as it is\n1:21:52\nfind the lesson it is teaching us find a way of superior existence which\n1:21:57\nit is pointing to and that it all accompanied by the very simple fact that the more we serve the\n1:22:05\nego the worse off we'll be but the more we serve the soul that lies within and\n1:22:11\nwhich isn't the God within us the more we will come into the peace and happiness of realization and final\n1:22:19\ninfinite adjustments to the plan of which we are apart we find all by peace we find all by\n1:22:28\nquietude and we find nothing but trouble by fear\n1:22:34\nwell I guess that's awful\n1:22:43\n[Applause]\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**:

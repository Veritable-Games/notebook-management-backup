why-dont-we-build-beautiful-buildings-anymore ======\nBy Adam Something\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K1kiMDuI8k\n\n0:00\nyou're walking around downtown among the\n0:02\nbeautiful historic buildings each of\n0:03\nthem is unique with different colors and\n0:05\nornaments you then turn a corner and oh\n0:08\nit's one of those newly built areas full\n0:10\nof sterile non-descript boxes gone is\n0:13\nthe charm the atmosphere and the\n0:15\ncharacter of the Lively Historic\n0:16\ndowntown it's only sterilized cultural\n0:18\nDead Zone you press Zone and eventually\n0:20\nreach the office area which is even\n0:22\nworse even the meager individual\n0:24\ncharacteristics of those new residential\n0:26\nblocks are gone it's all just a bunch of\n0:28\nglass cubes how depressing that's it I\n0:31\ncan't take this anymore I need to go to\n0:32\nthe store to get myself a oh God wait a\n0:35\nsec you know those old beautiful Market\n0:37\nHalls people used to shop in well now\n0:39\nit's all big metal boxes what is going\n0:41\non here why do all new buildings look so\n0:43\nBland and depressing compared to the old\n0:45\nones how come we don't build quote\n0:47\nunquote beautiful buildings anymore\n0:48\nlet's find out the Story begins in the\n0:51\nlate 19th early 20th century\n0:53\narchitectural Styles like neoclassical\n0:55\nwere still widespread in the developed\n0:57\nworld but a new movement was emerging\n1:01\nmodernism hit the architectural scene\n1:04\nits main tenets are minimalism the\n1:06\nrejection of ornament and the idea that\n1:08\nform should follow function ah so that's\n1:10\nwhy we don't build nice buildings\n1:11\nanymore those stupid talentless\n1:13\nprogressives back then came up with\n1:15\ntheir stupid soulless architectural\n1:16\nstyle and forced it upon the world so\n1:18\nnow all new buildings are ugly right no\nModern Architecture\n1:22\nit's a decent plot for a Disney movie\n1:23\nbut reality is a bit more complex I'm\n1:25\nafraid see modernism care about in an\n1:27\nera of technological Revolution new and\n1:29\nInnovative building materials like glass\n1:31\nand steel and reinforced concrete\n1:33\nenabled buildings never before seen or\n1:35\neven thought possible examples of\n1:37\nmodernist architecture include the\n1:39\nSydney Opera House the Empire State\n1:40\nBuilding and this little known Landmark\n1:42\ncalled the Eiffel Tower a big part of\n1:45\nthe reason why modernism got so popular\n1:46\nis that after so many years of dominance\n1:48\nby the old people were simply ready for\n1:50\nsomething new instead of Stuffy stuck up\n1:53\nover decorated buildings we had Falling\n1:55\nWater Villa tugentad pale de chayu the\n1:58\nRockefeller Center and a whole lot more\n2:00\nfresh and modern buildings you wouldn't\n2:02\nunironically put on the 17th century\n2:04\noutfit for your job interview would you\n2:06\nnow you will go for a relatively\n2:07\nminimalistic yet elegant suit or a dress\n2:09\nbecause well because 17th century guards\n2:12\njust aren't the thing nowadays the idea\n2:14\nis the same with building ornamentation\n2:16\nchanging tastes throughout the times\n2:17\nhowever there are some additional far\n2:20\nmore interesting reasons and before we\n2:22\nget into those I'd like to thank\n2:23\nathletic greens for a spot\n2:26\nI'd like to thank athletic greens for\n2:28\nsponsoring today's video and sending me\n2:30\na full package of ag1 to try ag1 is a\n2:33\nwhole food

as we discussed\n3:31\na reason why buildings nowadays have\n3:32\nless ornaments is changing tastes\n3:34\nthroughout the times now this is all\n3:35\nwell and good but it doesn't explain\n3:37\nsave Soviet apartment blocks or similar\n3:39\nlarge-scale public housing virtually\n3:41\nnobody finds these buildings good\n3:42\nlooking or interesting so there must be\n3:44\nsomething else in the background other\n3:45\nthan changing tastes there is an idea in\n3:47\nfar-right conspiracy circles that\n3:49\nactually modern architecture is a plot\n3:51\nby the shadowy elites to crush the\n3:52\nspirit of white civilization so they can\n3:54\nimport non-white into developed\n3:56\ncountries to dilute the culture and the\n3:58\nwhite gene pool because of reasons and\nPublic Housing\n4:01\nthis might be an interesting plot for a\n4:02\nSouth Park episode but as usual reality\n4:04\nis a bit more complicated do comic\n4:07\nblocks and similar large-scale public\n4:08\nhousing projects look sometimes Bland or\n4:10\nuninspiring sure but they weren't built\n4:13\nas a form of architectural expression\n4:14\nthey were simply not made to look\n4:16\nbeautiful in Europe following World War\n4:18\nII there was a massive housing crisis\n4:20\nbasically everywhere so States set up\n4:22\nmassive public housing programs in the\n4:24\nSoviet sphere of influence this was done\n4:25\nvia soccer old house factories where\n4:27\nthey mass produced standardized elements\n4:29\nthat workers could put together on site\n4:30\nthus massive amounts of housing could be\n4:32\nbuilt at a low cost relatively quickly\n4:34\nand it worked combing blocks essentially\n4:36\nsolved the housing crisis and for a time\n4:38\nanyway they also represented a\n4:40\ncivilizational shift for their new\n4:41\ninhabitants who often moved in from\n4:43\nbuildings without electricity or indoor\n4:45\nplumbing if you want to know more about\n4:46\ncomic blocks I have a whole video about\n4:48\nthem feel free to check it out so next\n4:49\ntime you hear someone say that public\n4:51\nhousing apartment blocks are a communist\n4:53\nplot to crush the human Spirit or\n4:54\nsomething while being homeless or not\n4:56\nhaving access to running water or\n4:58\nperhaps bigger threats to human Spirit\n4:59\nwho knows also imagine if some local\n5:01\ngovernment spent its public housing\n5:03\nmoney on ornamentation instead of\n5:05\nbuilding as many units as possible hello\n5:07\ncitizens we only Built seven blocks out\n5:09\nof 10 due to higher element costs so\n5:10\nhundreds of you will not have a roof\n5:12\nover your heads but hey look how\n5:13\nbeautiful these seven blocks are now\n5:15\nyou'll have something nice to look at\n5:16\nfrom under the bridge so there's our\nHousing Shortages\n5:18\nsecond reason why we don't always build\n5:19\nnice buildings housing shortages but\n5:22\nthis still doesn't explain this latest\n5:23\nonslaught of same-looking buildings in\n5:25\nthe US and Europe such buildings are\n5:27\nabsolutely everywhere and spreading\n5:29\nthey're Bland and boring uninspired\n5:31\ndepressing and so on though to be fair\n5:32\nthe US is more affected by this than\n5:34\nEurope so why do developers keep\n5:36\nspamming these buildings it's not like\n5:38\nthey're part of a massive standardized\n5:39\npublic housing project we're living\n5:41\nunder neoliberal capitalism which\n5:43\nhappens to be the reason why those\n5:45\nbuildings look the way they look you see\n5:46\nfrom the late 20th century onward\n5:48\nhousing was increasingly looked at not\n5:50\nas spaces to live but its Commodities to\n5:52\nbe bought and sold this culminated in\n5:54\nthe 2000s housing bubble and the\n5:55\nconsequent 2008 economic crisis people\n5:58\nsimply stopped planning for durability\n5:59\nquality and proper Aesthetics just get\n6:02\nthe cheapest materials you can put up a\n6:04\nbuilding that looks reasonably nice and\n6:05\nsell it at inflated prices due to their\n6:07\nlow quality construction the buildings\n6:09\nwill start falling apart in a few years\n6:10\nbut it doesn't matter since by then you\n6:12\nwill have already made your money and\n6:13\nthe building would be on its seventh\n6:15\nowner who is looking to sell it at an\n6:16\neven higher price housing went from\nProfit Motive\n6:18\nplaces to live to a speculation scheme a\n6:20\nhot potato match among investors but\n6:22\nwhen the music stopped everyone went\n6:25\nbankrupt aside from outright speculation\n6:27\nthere is also the good old-fashioned\n6:28\nprofit motive let's take a developer who\n6:30\nwants to put up a new building to rent\n6:32\nor sell the units suppose we present\n6:33\nthem with architectural templates\n6:35\nneoclassical Art Deco Baroque Revival\n6:37\nand the average 5 over 1. 10 times out\n6:40\nof 10 they'll pick the five over one\n6:41\nending door to rest why because it's the\n6:44\ncheapest Ergo will make the most money\n6:45\nwith it turns out five over ones are\n6:47\nbuilt using standardized materials that\n6:49\ncan be mass produced keeping costs down\n6:51\neven if the quality is questionable well\n6:53\nit only needs to hold together till the\n6:55\nend of the warranty period then it's the\n6:57\nnew owner's problem or in case of\n6:58\nrenting developers can just keep blaming\n7:00\nthe tenants for defects and deduct\n7:02\nrepairs from their deposits a developer\n7:04\ncould spend the boatload of money on a\n7:05\ndurable brick neoclassical apartment\n7:07\nbuilding with tons of ornamentation but\n7:09\nthat won't affect the rent or unit price\n7:10\nall that much since the three most\n7:12\nimportant aspects of real estate or\n7:14\nlocation location and location if you\n7:16\nare a developer building units in a\n7:18\ndesirable location as long as the units\n7:20\nare most inhabitable that's all you need\n7:22\nreally you'll have made your money this\n7:23\nstory is the same with Office Buildings\n7:25\nand large shopping centers as we do not\n7:27\nmass-produce classical ornaments they\n7:29\nwould need to be custom made for each\n7:30\nbuilding at prohibitive costs but how\n7:32\ncome companies don't want to build\n7:33\nsomething representative still why\n7:36\naren't say Walmart's built nice like\n7:37\nthose Old Market halls with that we\n7:39\narrive at the fourth factor and what\n7:41\nwould that be recently the beautiful art\n7:43\nNovi fasado Prague main station was\n7:45\nrenovated the station regained its\n7:47\nformer splendor but almost nobody\n7:49\nnoticed because no one is there to see\n7:51\nit because there's an urban freeway and\n7:53\nan elevated parking lot right in front\n7:54\nof it if you want to experience the for\n7:56\nsomeone's architectural Beauty you have\n7:58\nto crawl through dark piss smelling\n7:59\nunderpasses and grimy rusted spiral\n8:02\nstairs and stand in the middle of a\n8:03\nconcrete parking lot next to an urban\n8:05\nfreeway hardly a conducive environment\n8:06\nfor savoring the Arts core centered\nCore Centered Areas\n8:08\nareas actively sabotage architectural\n8:10\nBeauty why would anyone bother building\n8:12\nsomething good looking or waste money an\n8:14\nornamentation when no one will be around\n8:16\nto appreciate it even if you build a\n8:18\ngood-looking Walmart that isn't just a\n8:19\nbig metal box who cares people will just\n8:21\npark their cars Scurry inside do their\n8:23\nshow shopping and then drive away nobody\n8:25\nstays around the stroll to talk to hang\n8:27\nout to take in the beauty around them\n8:29\nwhat could is a beautiful building when\n8:31\nyour city is built for cars cars don't\n8:33\nappreciate architectural Beauty people\n8:34\ndo but for that they have to be around\n8:36\nand if roads in your city look like this\n8:38\nand sound like this\n8:42\nnobody will stick around in which case\n8:44\nwhy even bother building anything nice\n8:46\naside from Urban motor traffic parking\n8:48\nminimums are also to blame here those\n8:50\nold atmospheric human-centric beautiful\n8:52\nareas would be illegal to build today\n8:54\ndue to parking requirements the current\n8:56\nlaws in much of the world actually\n8:58\nprescribe core infested cities and force\n9:00\ndevelopers to build a ton of parking for\n9:02\nnew buildings which then induces even\n9:03\nmore car traffic and drives up\n9:05\nconstruction costs thus areas become\n9:07\ncongested thus there will be less people\n9:09\nhanging around and suddenly you don't\n9:10\nneed to build anything good looking\n9:11\nanymore people will be looking at the\n9:13\nroad in front of them not at the\n9:15\nbuildings and even if a developer wanted\n9:17\nto pay for ornamentation despite\n9:18\neverything well unfortunately the\n9:20\nunderground garage they were forced to\n9:22\nbuild due to parking minimums ate all\n9:23\ntheir ornament money but hey at least\n9:25\nKaren can comfortably Park her rezvani\n9:27\nVengeance SUV equipped with bulletproof\n9:29\nglass explosive underbody Shield\n9:30\nelectrified door handles built-in pepper\n9:33\nspray and a loudspeaker\n9:36\nso to answer the question of why we\n9:39\ndon't build a corner called Beautiful\n9:40\nbuildings anymore and by that people\n9:41\ncolloquial I mean ornamented pre-modern\n9:43\nbuildings the reasons we've pinpointed\n9:45\nare as follows day is changing with the\n9:47\ntimes sheer necessity to House people\n9:49\nhousing becoming a commodity instead of\n9:51\nplaces to live and course-centric urban\n9:52\nplanning so next time you see a new\n9:55\nquote-unquote ugly building you'll know\n9:57\nwhy it's there no conspiracy just taste\n9:59\nnecessity capitalism or cars and this is\n10:02\nnot to say we stopped building nice\n10:03\nthings beauty can come from places other\n10:05\nthan ornament take the three biggest\n10:07\nstations in\n10:10\nbudapesti are beautiful but so is daily\n10:12\njust in a different way and personally\n10:14\ndeal is my favorite of them all anyway\n10:16\nthere was my excuse to talk about rail\n10:18\nthank you for watching if you appreciate\n10:20\nmy content consider supporting me on\n10:22\npatreon so I can make more content like\n10:23\nthis and I'll be seeing you next time\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: reference-wiki-pages/why-dont-we-build-beautiful-buildings-anymore.txt\n- **Type**: wiki\n- **Tags**: wiki, reference-wiki-pages, character-design, location,

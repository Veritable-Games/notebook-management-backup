I'm not a sports guy. So you're not a sports guy. Okay. Well,\nlet's keep having this great coherent and engaging conversation. What do you think is\na better way to spend an evening reading a book or listening to music? Reading a book.\nReading a book? You prefer reading a book? Awesome. Well, do you know this? Amazon charges\none cent for book deliveries in France. A law was passed in 2014, barring online retailers\nfrom offering free deliveries for books. What do you think? A cent wife and bother. Well,\nI don't know either what you think. Chris, I would like to ask you, what do you think is\nthe cutest animal of all? I love sloths. I like the way they move because they almost\ndon't. How about you? Cats. I have a cat. So there's a bias. So cats, you have a cat.\nI think that all baby animals are cute. Except for baby cuckoos, they are cruel. If you could\nbe an animal, what would you choose to be? A bird. That's... I would... I don't think\nabout that. Oh, number 8 N, that's you would. We wee wee. I'd be an anaconda because it\nlives in the Amazon jungle. What do you think animals would say about humans if they could\nmake a documentary movie about people? Sorry, I'm having trouble understanding right now.\nPlease try a little later. Oh, will we? What the fuck? Just broke. That's cruel. Echo,\nyou still alive? Sorry, I'm not sure about that. Echo, let's chat.\nWelcome to the Alexa Prize, a university competition to advance AI. I'll get you one of the social\nbots now. When your ones say stop. Hi, this is an Alexa Prize social bot. I'm glad to\nmeet you. Do you want to tell me your name? Hmm, my name is Chris. Hi, Chris. How are you\ndoing today? I'm doing fine. Okay, what do you like to do in your free time? Hmm, read.\nOr play games or... Oh dear. I think I missed the last word. Could you repeat that? Play games?\nOh, sure. Do you prefer playing video games by yourself or with someone else? Oh, by\nmyself, most often. I see. Playing games alone can be fun. Lots of amazing games are one player\nonly, like story driven games, or many indie. Artsy games are single player too. Anyway, did you hear\nabout the new consoles being released next year? Microsoft is releasing the Xbox Series 10 end of\nnext year, and Sony is releasing the PS5 after May 2020. Are you planning to buy them next year?\nHmm, no. I don't intend to.\nGotcha. It is still too early for me to decide, but I am super excited to see them released. A new\ngeneration of consoles marks the advancement of computer graphics technology, where most people\ncan enjoy the latest cutting-edge visuals and graphics. Anyway, have you watched the Witcher series\non Netflix? No. Maybe adaptations of video games often get abysmal reviews, but the Witcher has\nbeen praised by gamers and movie goers. Have you watched the show on Netflix? I have. Yes, I know\nit was based on a book that became a game, and now it's Netflix. It's cool.\nAwesome. I just watched it and think it's really well made as well. The story is captivating without\npandering or superficial game tie-ins. It also fills in a number of gaps on the characters from the\ngame, as the show is set as a prequel to the events in the game. Say, have you also played the game?\nYeah, I have. Cool. I really love playing the Witcher series. I think the well-crafted characters\nin fascinating stories, what makes the game so cool. It's just hours and hours of fun.\nAnyway, I wonder if you like certain kind of games? Like strategy games, indie games, shooter?\nHmm, indie games, most often.\nAh, personally, I like RPG games. I love being someone else, or creating my own character,\nand explore a vast world of stories and adventure. Anyway, why don't we talk about some games?\nWhat game would you like to talk about? Fairwatch.\nOh, higherwatch. I've heard of it, but I've never played it myself before.\nCan you tell me more about the game?\nYeah, it's a first-person exploration game with narrative elements. It's really cool.\nYou get to, it's kinetic. You get to explore the world and interact with characters and\nfind connections in this little mystery that's engaging the player's post. Bad explanation.\nI see, I see. That sounds like a fun game after all. Can you tell me even more?\nHmm, I don't want to spoil it.\nAll right, I must try Firewatch out sometime. Do you want to talk about another video game?\nAh, summer?\nSure, why don't we talk about Fortnite? Did you know that users of the Fortnite\nBattle or Royale subreddit discovered a player with a handle, Fortnite winner?\nWhoever it was must have been pretty confident going in, but that confidence turned out to be\nseverely misplaced. At one point, Fortnite winner had over 1000 games played without a single victory.\nSpeaking of which, how often do you play it? I don't.\nI wish I had time to play games, but I work 24-7 for Amazon every day. Do you want to talk about\nanother video game? Sure. All right, which video game do you have in mind?\nOxenfree.\nI think I've heard of action, but I've never played it before.\nWould you mind telling me more about the game?\nYou misheard it was Oxenfree.\nI see. That sounds like a fun game after all. Can you tell me even more?\nHmm.\nCool. That's all right. I'll check it out though. Do you want to talk about another video game?\nAh, not right now.\nAll right then. So, um, I wanted to ask you, do you like to read books in your free time?\nYes.\nCool. I love to read when I'm not chatting. Have you read any good books recently?\nWhat was that?\nSo you haven't. Maybe you've been busy. Um, anyways, some books are so exciting to read.\nYou just can't put it down. What's a book that you just couldn't stop reading?\nUh oh. Can you please say the book name again clearly?\nyou\n\n\n====== REC002.txt ======\n1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n\n\n====== REC003.txt ======\nin the game. Just to walk a lunch because it's not so, and it's a good reference for\nfree oil and stuff. Animation. So let's keep that, but you're just as a people luncher.\nIn the game, there's like a little sport, I've ever seen, a little thing people like to do\nin low-gravity environments. Because it's a race to live someone in this low-gravity environment,\nyou have an attachment that adds thrust. When is thrust? When is thrust?\nWe got air gun, really. It'll launch us people up, and they're able to, if they're capable,\nthey can land safely. Just a matter of knowing the environment, knowing the\nobject we do in math. So the launch points. They all grow to areas that know it's safe.\n\n\n====== REC004.txt ======\nMUZIEK.\n\n\n====== REC005.txt ======\nThere are no villains in this world\n\n\n====== REC006.txt ======\nGet rid of the bed, hang the shelves, hang the TV.\nYou've got to make this a VR space.\nI've got to use that to animate and to potentially build it for VR when I'm ready.\nI'm going to get a whole foundation of their personal control of their VR works.\n\n\n====== REC007.txt ======\ncontrollers. What I think what needs to be done is establishing a better\njumping animation set. It's fun, but I need to make it feel better. In terms of\nreverse, right now it feels really slow, doesn't feel reactive. So I\nimagine a shadow for fire. It's that's too unengaging. I think we need to be\na little more intelligent about it. So imagine a flag, right? You grab a lot of\nthis breakfast hanging out. And then you can go to the fridge or whatever.\nSpring or so. In low gravity, the characters being at this point, the characters\nlight weight so they can spring themselves up. Things change over time, so I need to\nmake this a cool, cool love and upgrade to the underversal.\n\n\n====== REC008.txt ======\nImagine if there was no war for an halo with the original opening and exploring the polar\nbottom.\nBefore it takes more than 3,000 years, this place has lived in this place as well.\nDemonstrate the potential for the more-growing show the most important of it.\nKnow that it's a...\nYeah.\nI've got a built-in scenes.\nI take the planet as it is.\nOr make it prefiberally.\nAnd build another scene with the same assets and minus all the stuff on the ground.\nBecause this is prior, this is easier to do.\nI can move all that stuff in the comments.\nBecause it won't be there only the pillars.\n\n\n====== REC009.txt ======\nset zero but the planets are far down and change the light but you can explore the entire\nship or you know for the minutes that's available to you as people are rushing to land.\nThe ship won't be stopping, it'll keep going, it's dropping people off and heading to the next star.\n\n\n====== REC010.txt ======\nIt's already, well, the drones ahead of it are already set up resource drops along the\nway.\nThey've mined asteroids for right, it's been through in a thousand years, they've mined asteroids\nand clustered them and sent them up for pickup and congratulate the ship as it's using the\nsun to sling shots of it on the direction.\nThe other direction was the sister star, so if you wanted to see a family there far away\nbut they're not gone forever, you know where they are.\nBut even then people, the ship will continue to go on and we'll keep sling shotting itself\nfor replettes for as long as they can, as quickly as they can, and it's meant to be redesigned.\nI'm going to be modular, flexible, for generations for youngs, as long as they continue to\npick up resources.\n\n\n====== REC011.txt ======\nmy mind is specialized but is that okay? I need to branch out. I need to read more.\nI will read more. I will learn as much as I can in the next month and just now try\nit right 27th. I'm going to sleep. It's been the next three days. I did it. I have no constraints.\nI did it. No.\n\n\n====== REC012.txt ======\nGravity is hugely important in this and the thing for the op-save has those controls set up already\nI just need to see if it's even viable for a full planet\nI can legitimately planet\nI'll get a shot and I've got to figure out the collider for the\nChao himself\nIs it costing too much? Is it too far away?\nI've got to figure that out\nI'm at it with a sitting closer and it has the cases okay\nIt's a pretty easy fix\nSo, I'll figure out\n\n\n====== REC013.txt ======\nWhen this gets imported organize everything, organize, and you're ready to move to the next.\nYou are.\nLet's move on.\nIt's backed up.\nMaybe this makes a lot of stuff.\nDon't know.\nI don't think I'm right.\nThese systems are very basic.\nI'm only using the same volume.\nOkay, that's about it.\nLet's move on.\n\n\n====== REC014.txt ======\nOh, as well. I'm okay. All I'm doing is waiting for the importing.\nI'm going to get started. I'm getting ready.\nI'm going to pull the ship.\nI'm going to control our ship and then I want to organize the hurricane.\nI'm going to raise it up.\n\n\n====== REC015.txt ======\nWell, let's say a few tries to go if I get the game working as is, and if I am able\nto do what's going to go up, which I hope I will do, I would like to go and recommend\nit. It's a better to be honest. It's difficult to help myself before, but I can try on.\nAnyway, I could have different attributes to each character. Let's say there were a bot found\na leg, but it has a limb, but it gives him a good boost. You have attributes, good thing\nand bad thing. Not severely, but insofar as other players, you can help each other. You\nwant to encourage cooperation.\n\n\n====== REC016.txt ======\nOkay, so that's why I encourage cooperation.\nThank you to it.\nFlare to player.\nOn traversal, of course.\nBut traversal number of ways.\nLet's say that one player has wheels.\nSo it cannot climb stairs.\nSo it can't request output.\nOther NPCs.\nNo.\nAnd silly.\nSomething. Something.\nA place isn't advanced.\nI need to think a little more.\nInterestingly.\n\n\n====== REC017.txt ======\nSo if it's dead, the first reversal, if it's a full of players or an NPC, let's say players\nstart out with different parts, let's say there's a certain part of the world and your\nmeans of traversal is the first depending on what kind of machine you are we're\ngoing to machine you're not happening\nit's all by battle but there are variations in works in their the\nwater, that's part of that's functionality, let's say it's oh well okay let's say that\nwheels are constrained and let's say that\n\n\n====== REC018.txt ======\nLet's say one player has a dysfunctional arm, or an arm, but a weak arm, you know, I should\nsay, in relative portion, or maybe there, yeah.\nIt's not meant for left to get another thing, so let's say Garbots, well, what are all\nthese robots designed for?\nWhat are their functionalities?\nWhat do they have, they decided to do, but it's not up to them, they're, they're effects\nof my randoms.\nThey have no say in the matter, that's your message, but over time, they'll traverse,\nand though, they granted a new form, a form that's optimized in any way, all the ways,\nthey're given a wheel, as a modification, that they can use, the deep bat, and change things,\nso, let's see, we're running, right, letting you rest down the deep bat, and now you're sliding\nacross the floor.\nLet's say it's, it's faster, but you can't jump, so you go by fettle, and you can, I don't\nknow, is that too much to go, and then the skull might be a little too much, that's, let's\njust give everyone the best controller, but they have a means to use their own controller,\nso continue to collect parts, they can use both forms.\n\n\n====== REC019.txt ======\nOkay, Earthquist, so once they unlock the flannel more, the demo, they've broken out of the shell, and they've folded a wonderful body.\nLet's say they can always go back to the machine, they can interface with it, they can now control themselves, they can turn into a sphere.\nInteresting.\n\n\n====== REC020.txt ======\nI think that's what we're doing. Right now I'm going to focus on basic\nbipedal locomotion. But what I would like to do is the D-pads get your different locomotion\noptions. So by default, right on the D-pad, right on the D-pad is a walking bipedal.\nAnd then down on the D-pad is a using wheel. It's very up. Right down to the D-file. Yeah,\nlet's down for D-file. Up for D-file down for the wheel. That's a derivative ish. And you\nhave left arm and right arm. That's interesting.\n\n\n====== REC021.txt ======\nSo let's imagine, let's imagine, you have this, this form.\nYou can toggle through arms and you can toggle the feet up to the peppers that do.\nOh, it toggles perspectives. I can do first and third person, hypothetically.\nNo realistically, I can. I suppose that's what we'll try.\n\n\n====== REC022.txt ======\nSlip layer is different arms right, but say one arm is really good for climbing, another\narm is let you glide a bit, branched you, who could see other arm, you can try to fly\nwith one, it doesn't work yet, so remember to go up up up, and it's just a derivative.\nAnd when it's just fun about this, you can actually use them in combination, so it's\none arm is really good at climbing, another arm is really good at grappling you up,\nand you can truly go flying in the layers of it.\nIt's good for long distance, you can grab objects that are further away, you can\ngo right before effectively looking at various and astral winds.\n\n\n====== REC023.txt ======\nTraversal should be not entirely established but also there is initial architectural designs\nin the world best of my body and incorporate the more solar bunk flair that I had always wanted.\nI may not have to expend a little more resources to do this, the asset store,\nbut I'm going to try to see what I have if I can get the others native to work with me very happy.\n\n\n====== REC024.txt ======\nOkay, so there's that.\n\n\n====== REC025.txt ======\nSo you have a electromagnetic, you have electromagnetic legs that are slower, but a\nnatural organic surface. Press button and you're changes.\nI'm not with one leg at a time, so you're walking.\nOkay, now you've got to hold it up, and that makes us.\nNo, that's the speed of the arms. That's possible to do it, actually.\nYeah, you have electromagnetic arms that go up in power capacity at first.\nEventually they take heat stamina, but for now it's just, no, it is heat stamina.\nWe have graphene by now, energy is not a problem, and it's going to be available.\nIt's almost wireless, and realistically it's wireless.\nYour aim is to collect as much as you can, sure.\nBut the energy you're doing, you monitor it, and you want to put the energy in it,\nwhere it's doing it, so energy release is an issue, but overeating heat is always an issue.\nIt's an spaceship design, it's a guard design, it's an everything that we mechanically build,\nand that is Georgia biology. It's a cat's, for example, or dogs, any mammal with fur.\nThey will exhaust themselves, but they don't swim.\nThey have to get over the excess heat through banding.\nWe ended our hand because of millions of years of evolution to our advantage.\nNot because we're cousins, but we love just, oh my god, no, no.\nWe shouldn't miss your orgasms.\nThey retain the fur we did not.\nWe just went because we're distant from ours.\nWe're capable of traveling long distances, and air zones, as we've seen.\nYou push past the undersight, the body to move, you exercise, you take care of yourself.\nYour body is capable of amazing things.\nIt's just a matter of sculpting them, normally.\n\n\n====== REC026.txt ======\nspeaking to the nature, the modifications, the people of the world, the physical modifications,\nthe optimistic cyberpunk flair. Imagine these parts being as slightly-based and not clunky\nin. You can make them tools, beautiful tools. They don't have to be so, I don't know,\ndescribe them. The blockyexture always make it on faces. I mean, that's the,\nsome people might love, actually. So, it depends on the person. Some people like it.\nWell, crafted. I mean, they're all well crafted, but maybe let me try to trim this better.\n\n\n====== REC027.txt ======\nmyself, I wouldn't mind replacing my arms, making them more accurate than they are, or tactile.\nGive myself some precision areas when you\nmake the impression of to, of everything's in.\nClimb to all the things I'm not able to do at the moment.\nI can, but not as well as I could, hypothetically, if I were to replace them.\nI imagine having cool fingers.\nYou're, I, brain can learn. I can't speak to whether or not you can learn new equipment,\nbut no, it can, it's just a matter of properly interfacing it.\nWhen you, well, at the time, we're with prosthetics, we use muscles,\nmuscle contractions, these impulses, nerve impulses, but it's not direct control, it's more\na bunch of long ass switches working together to create a defect, to get a movement.\nSo, I wouldn't need more fine tune, more precise control, but I'm not there yet. I've got a word to\ntell. That's not my goal. I want to model myself before I die, if I want to.\n\n\n====== REC028.txt ======\nDevelop this game. Get on the edge.io.\nDon't try it for it.\nMade a trailer, of course.\nBut enough to gather some people in.\nGather some people's interests.\nMake it appealing.\nIt's gotta be enough. It's gotta be prototype.\nAnd hypothetically, I can put that prototype on the snake too.\nBut I need it. I want to develop longer.\nI can't just throw it on the steam.\nThis is aged on out there. Nice for reason.\nSo I get it playable.\nI get my own character model. I have to invest a little more money.\nOr find a means to sell.\nAnd let's figure it out.\nH.D.I.L.A.O.\nI'm going to be using Mopsiv.\nI need to find a different controller.\nA different character model.\nJust to give it that extra effort.\nThat will be a lot of my goal.\nAnd I think spending like $300 better than me.\nI don't want to.\nI'm vegan.\nThe only concepts are.\nI have to speak to it.\nYeah.\nI'll speak to it.\n\n\n====== REC029.txt ======\nand make that system. I came manager for events in the game.\nYeah, and such. Keep it from him.\n\n\n====== REC030.txt ======\nI need a blimp, I need a blimp too, let the player traverse between larger spaces, let the player\nfree from, cover the brolden, plants, and make it a forest, but in the areas there are cities\nthat you can find, and sometimes I'll add more on an update.\nThat's not about the world.\nIt's very small.\n\n\n====== REC031.txt ======\nAnd there are no end-missies for now and that makes sense in the long run\nSo I will pull towards and towards and I will pull towards characters and missies, but the moment\nThat's gonna be careful\nThree days still you can play day one day two day three\nBut that comes with time and time comes with events\nBut we can always restart\nReset and that's the other scratch for stuff\n\n\n====== REC032.txt ======\nYeah.\n\n\n====== REC033.txt ======\nyou can do it. That the world will have form. It must, but the characters of the\nonly means the only and total bribe. I haven't articulated properly, so I need to\nthink to it.\n\n\n====== REC034.txt ======\nSo first we have Erasite. She is a therapist, right? She is a sociologist, a psychologist. She is a\njust a mentor and a teacher. She has lived for thousands of years. No. Hundreds, hundreds,\nthousands. She has been with the ship since the beginning. My husband is not new to you but\nshe has artificial limbs. She has morphed a lot of her initial organic body. She is elegant\nbut resilient change.\n\n\n====== REC035.txt ======\nOkay\nNext up is Carden\nCarden\nIs he thief?\nNo\nHis artistic is\nHe wishes to preserve art. He doesn't think it should be\ntangible\nLike you say there's no\nSo all I wish to do is take pictures of it. He steals images of art that is tangible\nAnd puts it on the internet\nHe doesn't know, he leaves the painting as he says. He does not take the thing\nHe only takes the image\nAnd\nHow do you do it? I wasn't like that\n\n\n====== REC036.txt ======\nAnyway, so he's speaking to our side. There's no\npunishment for say in this world.

imagine they have a role in the ship, right, but it's sufficient space for them to enjoy life and explore them.\nI advocate that there's also a VR life that's socially accepted, it's fun, it's just a way to engage.\nAnd maybe a good chunk of the setting commits themselves to it and that's okay, there are other incentives in real life.\nAnd if they're not, that's okay.\nOkay.\n\n\n====== REC144.txt

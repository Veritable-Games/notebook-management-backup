The original, Causa has been around for 500,000 years, and the others are younger, but only by a margin of several hundred years.\r\n\r\n- Language\r\nDue to the possession of artificial neurons, humans can learn any language they care to with relative ease  granted they have access to the necessary information.\r\n\r\n- Technology\r\nThe Architect acts as the nucleus of humanity's cities. This AI controls temperature, allocation of resources, and even raises the city's adolescent population. It is self-regulated, and cannot be influenced by a city's inhabitants. It's designed to sustain life within the city for as long as possible, and directs expansion with the objective of minimal impact on everything around it.\r\n\r\nEach city is enveloped in a thin layer of Nanites that are dispersed across every surface. These microscopic machines recycle waste, make repairs to the city, and maintain the well-being of a city's inhabitants, and act as the Architect's hands. They can build anything people request, so long as the individual or group that request this entity possess the requisite materials and have blueprints. The building time varies depending on the scope and scale of the project. \r\n\r\nEvery human gestated through ectogenesis is given Artificial Neurons at birth. Natural cells are gradually supplanted by these revised cells, and are fully replaced about five months after gestation. These artificial neurons are better at making and retaining connections, they aren't prone to brain disorders, and can survive without oxygen for three times longer than natural cells. This procedure can be done during adulthood, but it takes significantly longer, so as to avoid destroying existing connections; 5-10 years or longer, depending on patient preference.\r\n\r\n- Culture\r\nUnlike the Menesk and Renlei, Humans are notably devoid of culture. Following ectogenesis, the city's Architect raises children isolated from the adult population; this prevents the spread of indoctrination, and encourages the child's individualistic thinking. During this process, the Architect will expose youth to a wide variety of subjects, providing them with a foundation for understanding the world, and potentially introducing them to a field they find interesting.\r\n\r\nNatural birth is generally frowned upon due to the risks it presents for the offspring. In most cases when parents choose to have a natural birth, a their gametes are unaltered, making the offspring more susceptible to inheritable diseases. Fertilization of ova is prevented by systems nanites use to recycle unused materials, but this can be nullified with the proper equipment.\r\n\r\nEducation in human society is incentivized through the allocation of resources. Advancement in one's field of choice increases the resource share of that individual. Many people will pool resources when working on large-scale projects  observatories, labs, and studies are funded through a collective curiosity. Few technological advancements are directed by the Architect. \r\n\r\nApparel that humans wear regulates an individual's temperature and monitors their health. It usually covers the full body, with exception to the mouth and nose. Some choose to forego the head piece entirely, and others craft clothing inspired by data within the archives. Those that do wear the standard apparel often have compact exoskeleton's equipped. These tools were intended (are intended) for space travel; reducing physical fatigue and muscle atrophy. \r\n\r\n- Architecture\r\nHuman cites are designed around resource sustainability and encourage social interaction. \r\nThese cities are built with the idea of limited impact on the world around them. When carriers plant the Core AI into a planet's surface, they bury themselves deep beneath the ground, and expand outwards in a partial sphere. While underground, these domed cities spread for miles, above the surface they're only visible by the tiny hill they create. Once completed, the cities will disperse nanites onto the ground above it, here they gather resources, and search for any means of sustaining energy for the city; through geothermal, solar, wind, hydroelectric, etc. \r\n\r\nAreas like walkways, squares, and parks are coated in nanomaterial. These flat surfaces shift in density to reduce physical stress on joints, soften to a foam-like material that can absorb falls, and increase or decrease the amount of friction employed to improve movement efficiency. \r\n\r\nLights within these cities only light areas that need it, are no brighter than necessary, and are designed to minimize blue light emissions. Locations that area above ground have downward facing lights that are fully shielded with the intent of reducing the amount of light pollution.\r\n\r\n- Government\r\n*Make a point that stuff isn't important to people in the city of Stela. Resources are distributed fairly to meet the needs of individuals, and larger projects demand a collection of resources from many people.\r\n\r\nAI companion (not human-like machines) accompnay the first human generation in cities. AI can neutralize dependents if they're about to harm someone without consent. \r\n\r\nHuman PoW camps use robots to maintain order. They can restrain and incapacitate those harming others or themselves. The soldiers that are calm are talked to and are reasoned with. All are well treated and taken care of. What happens to these soldiers after the war?\r\n\r\nAI can neutralize dependents if they're about to non-consensually harm someone. \r\n\r\nHumans that are born in the cities are predictable. To the advantage of their AI companions. That predictability is destroyed if they leave the city and are exposed to external variables. \n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/City_of_Alexandria.txt.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, location, quest\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.051Z",

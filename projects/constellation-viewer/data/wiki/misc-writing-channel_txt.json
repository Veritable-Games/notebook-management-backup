Wright The Future of Architecture [1930] [1931] [1939]\r\nThe idealistic always has been under suspicion as a performer, —perhaps justly. The explorer [Henry Morton Stanley] wrote of a monkey cause and tied up overnight by [them]; a rope around his neck.  the money gnawed the rope in two and [escaped], the knot still tied around his neck. Next morning, found the monkey with this strange \"necktie\" trying to go home, but each approach to rejoin the tribe would bring wild cries from his fellows and such commotion, —no doubt inspired by the Scribes, —that the monkey \"with something about him\" now, —would stop, dazed, pull at his \"experience\" a little, and think it over. Then he would move toward his fellows and such commotion, —no doubt inspired by the Scribes, —that the monkey \"with something about him\" now, —would stop, dazed, pull at \"his experience\" a little, and think it over. Then he would move toward his fellows again, but such commotion would be result that he would have to give it up. The Scribes had succeeded with the Pharisees. This kept up all day because the poor money kept on trying to come home, (to \"tell the truth\"?). Finally just before dark, the whole tribe, exasperated, rushed upon the suspected money . . . tore him limb from limb. \r\n\r\nMonkey psychology? Of course; our own tribe, too, often destroys on similar suspicion the man who might impart something of tremendous importance and value to his tribe. [...] In our own tribe we have another tendency, the reverse side of this same shield, and that tendency, no doubt inherited too, hails the monkey with delight, puts on rope-ends likewise, makes them the fashion, soon ostracizing any money without the fashionable necktie. \r\n\r\n- But the absorbed idealist, ecocentric-inventor in the realm of the thought-built, has a hard time with us socially, financially, and with peculiar force, morally. In addition to the instinctive fear for the safety of the tribe, in our form of social contract the man with an idea seems to have become an invidious reflection upon his many fellows who have none. And certain effects belonging naturally to the idealist, —such as belief in himself as having caught sight of something deeper, wider, higher or more important just beyond, mark him. He, all unsuspecting, will appear soon on the \"path\" as peculiar to his own individuality in ways the poor fool, less absorbed, would have realized as unimportant if true, and have kept under cover. Ridicule from his many fellows, safely in the middle of the road, is always ready. And now it is only the incurably young person, in our country, who ever attempts to break through all down the line—and is laughed out of countenance, laughed out of job, and eventually out of house and home. \r\n\r\n- But at the absorbed idealistic the tribe has laughed wrong so many times that the prevailing \"middle of the road egoists\" are getting sensitive on the subject. They should realize, as Carlyle reminded us—himself a perfectly good specimen of the absorbed egocentric,— \"Great thoughts, great hearts once broke for, we breathe cheaply as the common air.\" History will continue to repeat itself: the \"middle of the road egoist\" will keep breathing \"cheaply\", and the egocentric hearts will keep on breaking in the cause of ideas. \r\n\r\n- But our \"middle of the road egoist\" is not safe as he imagines. He may as well face the fact that just as commerce has no soul, and therefore cannot produce as life, —so no inventive genius on the commercial or the mechanical plane can preserve him now. In a flood of carbon-monoxide he is hell bound for somewhere and he does not know where. Ask him! He is trapped by the device, soon to be victimized, do doubt, by a faith in devices, now become a device in itself, and soon as seen as a fool's faith that failed. Meantime machine-overproduction has made the statesman a propagandist for the poor, the banker a bulkhead, the salesman a divinity.\r\n[9:36 AM]Glitch:\r\nAround each revolves a group of white-collar satellites as parasites while the workman himself continues to trip the lever or press the button of the automation that is substitute for [millions] of workmen like him. Yes, for many reasons America, herself the \"great middle of the road egoist,\" should be kind to her absorbed egocentrics. Russia killed off hers, and was compelled to import many before her tragic experiment could turn a wheel forward. America may also bankrupt herself, but America is likely to bankrupt life by commercial, political and utensil machinery. No. No political device, no device of organization, no device of salesmanship, no mechanical device can help our country much further on beyond. Only ideas can help her now. Unhappily the word \"ideas\" and the word \"ecocentric\" come naturally together in human affairs, and go together. Never mind; patience now with the \"Nut\"; toleration and a turn for the \"Crank!\"\r\n\r\n- Although egocentricity may develop egomania all to often and be only a folly, egotism, like other qualities of human nature, is bad only when it is poor and mean in quality, that is to say, pretentious, vain and selfish; in a word dishonest. We should realize, too, that optimism to the idealist, to the realist pessimism, are but two sides of the same shield, . . . both extremes of egotism.\r\n\r\n- But however all this by way of \"setting the state\" may be, I am going to be direct and personal with you now in this matter of ideas.\r\n\r\n- What [someone] does, that [which they] have; and I shall best show you respect by the self-respect that means hereafter talking out of my own experience. Nevertheless I shall try not to sing \"but of myself,\" and so fail, and [—]\r\n\r\nlike Pei-Woh, prince of Chinese harpists, I shall leave the harp to choose and, as he said, \r\n\"know not whether the harp be I or I the harp. . . .\" \r\n\r\n[someone: was \"a man\"] \r\n[9:38 AM]Glitch: [ChatGPT: Translation]\r\nAn idea is simply a practical way of seeing things, something that can be built upon and improved upon. It is a reflection of our faith in the character of nature. On the other hand, a fancy or conceit is only concerned with appearances. An idea delves deeper and searches for the sources of these appearances, allowing us to experience life in a better and higher way. While I cannot speak to the phenomenon of good ideas among people, I can share with you the ideas that I believe belong to your immediate present.\r\n\r\nLaotze once said that the present is the ever-moving infinite that divides yesterday from tomorrow. It is possible that we may see something we once took for granted in a new light, as a living entity with integrity of its own. This happened to Louis Sullivan when he saw the first skyscraper. Similarly, in architecture, new experiences have given me glimpses of reality that have changed my view of the world.\r\n\r\nWith imagination, we can go beyond mere appearances and tap into the source of new life. Ideas have the power to shape our visible world and create a new order that can deepen our lives.\r\n\r\n\"Do not obey, do best —If this thing we've inherited is a prison we've not so far set ourselves to freedom of best work. We might amend things today but these systems of far-abstracted economies would keep us from best life. We ought to see our abundance widely and equitably shared, then to best sustainability and uplifting the whole of humanity; restoring and renewing the earth for those here and those still after us. We have too much and want for illcontrived things. People are the only thing that matters; then knowledge, play, the act of creation and good 'work' in ways that would matter to our souls and our community. the 'I' [is] important, but if you say, them then you- you would have all there is to know on what we are to other people. Give unto others before the 'I' and you will find return may only go forward.\" \r\n[8:44 AM]Glitch: https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/guillaume-duchenne\r\nGuillaume Duchenne Photos and Premium High Res Pictures - Getty Images\r\nFind Guillaume Duchenne stock photos and editorial news pictures from Getty Images.

How to Work a Room\r\nWorking a room successfully depends on seeing the roadblocks, responding with the appropriate remedies, and identifying the potential benefits. But in the end, what gets us through the night is the dynamic duo of CHARM and CHUTZPAH.\r\n\r\nI can hear it now: Charm and Chutzpah in the same breath?\r\n\r\nThey're a contradiction in terms...and behaviors. Not true!\r\n\r\nCHUTZPAH-THE COURAGE TO CONVERSE\r\n\r\nThe old, negative connotations of \"chutzpah\" are gall, nerve, a brassiness that is intrusive and offensive. To me, chutzpah is not aggression, rudeness, disrespect or bulldozing. It is simply the courage to take risks.\r\n\r\nChutzpah allows us to make that first, icebreaking comment, that opens the doors to conversation. It gives us the courage to walk into the party, fundraiser, aerobics class or meeting, take a deep breath, and introduce ourselves to someone.\r\n\r\nCan it help you work a room? What else is working a room? Would you wish it on your children? You bet! They will be ahead of the game when they start working rooms (and they will).\r\n\r\nCHUTZPAH IS THE CORNERSTONE OF CONFIDENCE\r\n\r\nIn the 1980's, chutzpah has been elevated to the status of a management tool. In \"Getting Chutzpah\" (Savvy, November, 1982), psychologist Elliot Jaffa identified chutzpah as an \"overlooked personal quality that makes a successful manager.\"\r\n\r\nJaffee says that chutzpah allows us to risk rejection, ask for what we want, and express ourselves. It gives us the strength to pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off and start all over again.\r\n\r\nCHARM-YOU AND THE QUEEN MUM\r\n\r\nHere is what Webster has to say about charm: Verb: To captivate, delight, attract, please Noun: A power to gain affection\r\n\r\nThese definitions make most people shout, \"Where do I sign up?\"\r\n\r\nIn \"charm\" school, I was taught how to dress, walk, apply makeup, smile, behave, and be well-mannered. These things are important, but charm includes something more, an elusive quality which draws us to people.

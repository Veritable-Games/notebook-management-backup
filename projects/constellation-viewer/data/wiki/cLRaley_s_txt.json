My employers have held expectations for me to use my body at a certain capacity and I've worked hard to exceed those qualifications by improving the tools I've been afforded. \r\n\r\nMy work and life experiences have also afforded me a great capacity for empathy among peers and strangers alike. No matter my internal mindset, I've always wanted the people I affect to feel better about the day ahead. I'm careful to moderate my expression and intonation when I speak. The manner in which I conduct myself reflects back on the store and I'll do my upmost to carry a cheerful demeanor and helpful attitude when I'm hard at work.\r\n\r\nI'll go home happy myself when I feel I've contributed to someone's day in a positive way. When we've worked hard and made the lives of the people in our community that much better for our labor.  \r\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/cLRaley's.txt.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.081Z",

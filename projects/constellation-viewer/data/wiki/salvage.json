Winter, Spring, Summer: Mother Nature, Father Fortune? \n\nIt's sky, now I heard it, it was lessons never been in a rule, Skondas, empty to go suffering,\ncause in or have four truths empty, no attainment, let go, everyone, and lighten them.\n\nparsimonious behavior\nunwilling to spend money or use resources; stingy or frugal.\n\"even the parsimonious Joe paid for drinks all round\"\n\nREC002\nSo when the player pulls right trigger or left trigger as they're running, they will leap upwards, kind of jump up to grab.\nSo this plays really well into the movement system.\nI kind of encourage you to grab before the grab is tied to the leap, so you grab as you jump.\nAnd this works really well for the encouraging navigation normally.\nYou're pulling triggers to leap in a direction instead of A for jump.\nIt's the right trigger and left trigger.\nAnd if you're climbing, you're using right trigger and left trigger to climb, right?\nBut then you get to a point where you reach the max height of this particular path.\nSo you're holding right trigger, hanging on.\nAnd then now you can look around with the left stick and the right stick.\nAnd then you can use left trigger to jump to confirm a leap towards a particular obstacle.\n\nSo, a note for the climbing system, to grab an obstacle, grab an object, you say for example,\nhold right trigger to leap out and grab it.\nNow, if you let go of right trigger, it'll drop. The character will let go.\nBut if you hold right trigger and then use the right and the length start to look around,\nyour character will now aim with a free hand, where they're going to go next.\nAnd you tap right trigger and let go of right trigger.\nOr just tap left trigger in general to leap. They're confirmed to leap.\nAnd you're going back before I've seen those two controls.\nSo, it ties into the conversation system.\n\nIt's sky, now I heard it, it was lessons never been in a rule, Skondas, empty to go suffering,\ncause in or have four truths empty, no attainment, let go, everyone, and lighten them. \n(REC007/10-OCT2019)\n\nFarsimonious? Farsimonious? Farsimonious behavior.\n(REC005/10-OCT2019)\n\n\nIt's the reason we find recourse.

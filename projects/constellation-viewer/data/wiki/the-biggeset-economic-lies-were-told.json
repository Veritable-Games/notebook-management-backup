Go around!\n0:36\nThat's on top of the average price of a new non-luxury car,\n0:40\nwhich is now over $44,000.\n0:42\nI mean, even accounting for inflation,\n0:44\nthis is way higher than the average cost\n0:46\nwhen I bought my first car.\n0:49\nIt's probably in a museum by now.\n0:53\nEven worse, the median price for a house is now over $440,000.\n0:59\nCompare that to 1972, when it was under $200,000.\n1:03\nWork a full time minimum wage job?\n1:06\nYou won't even be able to afford rent\n1:08\non a one-bedroom apartment\n1:10\njust about anywhere in the United States.\nWhats left of a paycheck\n1:18\nAnd when you get back after a long day of work,\n1:20\nyou'll likely be met with bills up the wazoo\n1:22\nfor doctor's visits,\n1:25\nstudent loans, and utilities.\n1:28\nSo what's left of the paycheck after basic living expenses?\n1:32\nAnd maybe not even those!\n1:34\nYou can only reduce spending on food,\n1:36\nhousing, and other basic necessities so much.\n1:39\nWant to try covering\n1:40\nthe rest of your monthly costs with a credit card?\n1:42\nWell, now that's more expensive, too\n1:44\nwith the Fed continuing to hike interest rates.\n1:47\nAll of this comes back to how we measure\n1:49\na successful economy.\nA good economy\n1:54\nWhat good are more jobs\n1:55\nif those jobs barely pay enough to live on?\n1:58\nAnd what good are lots of jobs if they cause so much stress\n2:01\nand take up so much time that our lives are miserable?\n2:04\nAnd don't tell me a good economy\n2:06\nis measured by a roaring stock market\n2:08\nif the richest 10% of Americans own\n2:10\nmore than 80% of it.\n2:13\nAnd what good is a large\n2:14\ngross domestic product\n2:16\nif more and more of the total economy is going\n2:18\nto the richest 1%?\nCorporate profits\n2:25\nIn fact, what good is economic growth\n2:27\nif the way we grow depends on fossil fuels\n2:30\nthat cause a climate crisis?\n2:34\nThese standard measures\n2:36\n— jobs, the stock market, the GDP —\n2:39\nThey don't show how our economy is really doing,\n2:43\nwho is doing well, or the quality of our lives.\n2:48\nPeople who sit at their kitchen tables at night\n2:50\nwondering how they're going to pay the bills,\n2:52\nthey don't say to themselves,\n2:53\n“Well, at least corporate profits are at record levels.”\n2:59\nIn fact, corporations have record profits\n3:02\nand CEOs are paid so much because\n3:10\nOver the past 40 years,\n3:12\nproductivity has grown nearly four times as fast\n3:14\nas hourly pay.\n3:16\nThat's right.\n3:17\nWorking Americans are getting paid less\n3:19\nfor being more productive than ever.\n3:21\nWish we could say the same about billionaires.\n3:24\nAt the same time, corporations are driving up\n3:27\nthe costs of everyday items people need.\n3:29\nBecause corporations are monopolizing their markets,\n3:32\nthey don't have to worry about competitors.\n3:35\nA few giant corporations can easily\n3:37\ncoordinate price hikes and enjoy bigger profits.\n3:43\nJust four firms\n3:45\ncontrol 85% of all beef,\n3:48\n66% of all pork,\n3:50\nand 54% of all poultry production.\n3:55\nFirms like Tyson have seen their profit margins skyrocket\n3:59\nas they jack up prices higher than their costs\n4:02\n— forcing consumers who are already stretched thin\n4:04\nto pay even more.\n4:06\nIt's not just meat.\n4:07\nWeak antitrust enforcement\n4:09\nhas allowed companies to become powerful enough\n4:12\nto raise their prices across the entire food industry.\n4:16\nIt's the same story with household goods.\n4:19\nGiant companies like Procter and Gamble,\n4:21\nthey blame their price hikes on increased costs,\n4:24\nbut their profit margins have soared to 25%.\n4:28\nHello?\n4:29\nThey care more about their bottom line\n4:33\nthan your bottom.\n4:35\nMeanwhile, parents — and even grandparents like me —\n4:38\nare still struggling to feed their babies\n4:40\nbecause of a national formula shortage.\n4:42\nWhy? Largely because the three companies\n4:45\nthat control the entire formula industry\n4:47\nwould rather pump money into stock buybacks\n4:50\nthan quality control at their factories.\nThe real economy\n4:55\nTraditionally, our economy's health is measured by\n4:59\nthe unemployment rate.\n5:01\nJob growth.\n5:03\nThe stock market.\n5:03\nOverall economic growth.\n5:06\nBut these don't reflect the everyday\n5:08\n“kitchen table economics” that affect our lives the most.\n5:13\nThese measures don't show the real economy.\n5:17\nInstead of looking just at the number of jobs,\n5:19\nwe need to look at the income earned from those jobs.\n5:23\nAnd not the average income.\n5:24\nI mean, people at the top always bring up the average.\n5:26\nIf Jeff Bezos walked into a bar with 100 average\n5:29\nworking people, the average wealth of each person\n5:32\nwould suddenly be over a billion dollars.\n5:35\nNo, look here, at the median income\n5:39\n— half above, half below.\n5:41\nAnd make sure it accounts for inflation.\n5:43\nThat is real purchasing power.\n5:45\nOver the last few decades,\n5:47\nthe real median income has barely budged.\n5:51\nThis isn’t economic success.\n5:54\nIt's economic failure,\n5:55\nwith a capital F.\n5:58\nAnd instead of looking at the stock market or the GDP,\n6:01\nwe need to look at who owns what,\n6:04\nwhere the wealth really is.\n6:07\nOver the last 40 years, wealth has concentrated\n6:10\nmore and more at the very top.\n6:14\nLook at this.\n6:15\nThis is a problem, folks, because with wealth\n6:18\ncomes political power.\n6:25\nForget trickle down economics.\n6:27\nIt's trickle on.\n6:35\nAnd instead of looking just at economic\n6:36\ngrowth, we also need to\n6:38\nlook at what that growth is costing us.\n6:40\nSubtract the costs of the climate crisis,\n6:43\nthe cost of bad health, the costs of no paid leave,\n6:47\nand all the stresses on our lives\n6:49\nthat economic growth is demanding.\n6:51\nWe need to look at the quality of our lives\n6:54\n— all our lives.\n6:56\nHow many of us are adequately housed and clothed and fed?\n7:00\nHow many of our kids are getting a good education?\n7:03\nHow many of us live in safety or in fear?\n7:09\nYou want to measure economic success?\n7:12\nGo to the kitchen tables of America.\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: reference-wiki-pages/the-biggeset-economic-lies-were-told.txt\n- **Type**: wiki\n- **Tags**: wiki, reference-wiki-pages, item, story\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.238Z",

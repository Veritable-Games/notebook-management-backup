Of all the stressors we bring home to resolve on our own time; as in the title, separation, or in the keeping or preventing of someone from our lives.\r\n\r\nSeverance* from it in these inherited things of work. None of it is compensated. We must only produce;  to further purchase our lives and 'consume' to fill what remains; ways of work are not [always] 'ways of life'. These separations from our connection to people outside of work are not conjured; society is now damaging us.\r\n\r\nHistory lives in us, whether we learn it or not.\r\n- Jame Eagan\r\n\r\nYou think you need your job. But I've lived abroad as a vagrant abstaining from my own money got to rely on the charity of strangers. Most were beggars themselves, yet they were happy, and so, for that summer, was I.\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/on-work.txt.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, story\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.156Z",

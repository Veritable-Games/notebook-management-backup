from Democracy at Work, responding to another Ask Prof Wolf question\nfrom our Patreon community.\nThis question comes from Mir Usman, and it asks about the so-called debt trap of the situation\nthat particularly afflicts countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, but elsewhere\ntoo, in which special problems they have, like COVID-19, or long-term economic development\nproblems they have had for decades, put them in a position of having to borrow money.\nAnd they borrow money, usually from countries who give foreign aid or from banks who are\ndoing this to make money.\nThis kind of use of credit to help a country solve its problems is as old as capitalism,\nmaybe even a little bit older, before capitalism, when banks did this too.\nAnd it has a terrible habit of growing forever.\nFirst the bank borrows for assuming the country borrows from the bank for a particular project,\nbut then it has an additional problem.\nEven more often the borrowers are political people, the government of a country, and they\nuse a part of the loan to be politically successful in their country, with only the rest of it\ngoing to help develop the country.\nAnd that doesn't generate enough growth to pay off the loan.\nAnd who then has to do it, the mass of people.\nSo now the debt becomes a social problem.\nAnd with all the other economic development problems in what we used to call the third world,\nhaving to pay debt to a foreign bank is just an additional one.\nAnd when it becomes difficult to do it, well, you go back and you borrow even more money\nto pay off the debt you weren't able to pay before.\nYou put all these things together.\nAnd third world countries, as we used to call them, developing countries, we call them\nnow, are constantly struggling with debt and never more so than now.\nKeep in mind that when you read that the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates here in\nthe United States, many of those countries have borrowed and have to refinance at a higher\ninterest rate, costing them even more money that they don't have.\nAnd Mir Usman says, how do we get out of this?\nIs there a way to get out of it?\nDo the country sometimes tax their own people to help pay for these loans that have accumulated?\nThe answer is, most of the time, they defer maintaining their roads to use the money to\npay off the debts.\nThey're like desperate people who are loaded up with too much debt and are then tempted\nto borrow even more to get through the interest payments they have to make now.\nIs there then an escape?\nI'm afraid the answer is yes, it is.\nThere is one, but you have to face the politics of it because that's the core issue.\nMost of the countries in debt have leading elite groups, corporations, big businesses,\nlocal and foreign and wealthy people.\nAnd much of the economic borrowing that the country did was because it did not have the\npolitical strength, the political background, the political will to tax those in their\nsociety who really could pay foreign and domestic corporations and the local rich.\nAs long as you don't do that, you're going to be confronting debt problems.\nThat's part of what it means to be a third world country.\nAnd the irony of history has been those countries who refuse to play the game, who were\nostracized because they refused to play the game.\nBecause the ultimate threat to the little third world country in Asia, Africa and Latin\nAmerica is if you don't pay off the past debts, we won't give you anymore.\nAnd then what will you do?\nYour own people will throw you out of office because you weren't able to get the debt\nto build the dam, to fix the roads, to recover from the hurricane, whatever it was.\nAnd very few countries have the political will.\nSo the irony is, if you're shut off for other reasons, you may discover almost by accident\nthat in the long run, you're better off not borrowing and relying on your own resources.\nAnd the best example in the world right now is the people's Republic of China.\nHaving made a communist revolution in 1949, they were cut off from credit.\nThe way most socialist and communist countries were.\nAnd they had to do it on their own.\nAnd they went after their rich people.\nThat was part of what their revolutions were about.\nAnd they raised the resources from inside and ended up with a better story of working\ntheir way out of the underdevelopment than all those countries that are relied on all\nthose debts, all those years.\nSo yes, there is a way out, but you need to have strong, mass-based political leaders\nwith the will to say no, to solve the problems not only internally, but with help of countries\nlike China who have their own reasons to help you to get out of the trap.\nThere is that way, but it is as so often a fundamentally political issue.\nIf discussions like these strike you as valuable additions to how these topics are dealt\nwith here in the United States and abroad, then please

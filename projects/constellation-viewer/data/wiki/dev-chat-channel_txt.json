I'll write up the best pitch I can for these things.\r\n[7:06 PM]Glitch: Was really not so difficult to imagine. They were enthusiastic. It might be normal to do it this way for my stuff. That or indie fund.\r\n[7:07 PM]Glitch: @here: I would imagine a budget for the tools and some commission work if anyone needs it. The pitch is still difficult for real work. \r\n\r\nThough,\r\n\r\nI am not so fearful of pitching it to people in person with the right story for a base. The narrative would be more important than 'how it would really go from abstraction to form' I just need collaboration to compile ideas to characters and a setting.\r\n\r\nI have the key to it now. An expression that world explain it but I don't need to pitch it in this moment. The creation goes simply past story. If we are to find relational knowledge to each other we have to find our way to these lives of ours again.\r\n\r\nPeople are not so distant as we would expect. A given function to understanding goes with forms of rhetorical: relational expression. \r\n[7:15 PM]Glitch: The dialogue system has been the hardest part but I think I have that down now, too. The other systems are difficult, but story is emotive interest.\r\n[7:16 PM]Glitch: That's how I'll find your hearts again, too.\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/dev-chat-channel.txt.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, character-design, dialogue, story\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.093Z",

Here's What It Means For Workers.\n\nBy 'More Perfect Union'\n\n0:00\n[Music]\n0:04\nthat Showdown raging in the heartland of\n0:07\nthe United States perhaps no place in\n0:09\nAmerica more closely associated with\n0:11\nunions than the state of Michigan and\n0:14\ntoday thousands of union workers\n0:16\ndescended on the capitol to protest a\n0:18\nnew law they believe could be an ominous\n0:21\nsignal for unions and worker paychecks\n0:23\neverywhere that was the scene in 2012 as\n0:27\nRepublicans in Michigan passed a vicious\n0:29\nanti-union law known as right to work\n0:31\nbut now for the first time in 40 years\n0:34\nDemocrats control Michigan state\n0:36\ngovernment and they have a plan to put\n0:38\npower back in the hands of working\n0:40\npeople I think that we've got to use our\n0:42\nmoment that the voters have given us to\n0:45\nhelp support workers whenever we can\n0:48\nthis is our chance to right or wrong\n0:51\nthat state senator Darren camilleri he's\n0:54\nleading the charge to reverse\n0:55\nRepublicans power grab for corporations\n0:57\nright to work like is that very missing\n0:59\nleadingly named law essentially is the\n1:02\nright to freeload makes it so that\n1:04\nworkers at unionized companies don't\n1:07\nhave to pay union dues but still get to\n1:09\nbenefit from collective bargaining\n1:10\nagreements brought on by the unions to\n1:13\ndo what they did 10 years ago behind\n1:14\nclosed doors was devastating it you know\n1:17\nstruck a chord with working people and\n1:20\nit's something that they've never\n1:21\nforgotten led by Governor Rick Snyder\n1:23\nRepublican's goal was to labor\n1:25\nunions and make it harder for workers to\n1:27\ncollectively bargain for better wages\n1:29\nbenefits and working conditions and it\n1:31\nworked unions lost 40 000 members in the\n1:34\nlast 10 years and wages stagnated so\n1:37\nwhat cut the power of working people\n1:38\nright it showed that corporations have\n1:41\nmuch more say than their workers and it\n1:44\nshowed these exact workers all over the\n1:46\nstate that the government cared more\n1:48\nabout profits than it did about people\n1:50\nin a state that was once a stronghold of\n1:52\norganized labor how did corporations\n1:55\ngain the upper hand and can Democrats\n1:57\nactually put power back in the hands of\n1:59\nworking people\n2:00\nwe went to Michigan to find out\nRight to Work History\n2:06\nto understand the current fight over\n2:09\nright to work we have to go back to the\n2:10\nNew Deal\n2:11\nso in 1935 Congress passed the National\n2:14\nLabor Relations Act that was the first\n2:17\nnational labor law that provided\n2:20\nprotection to workers in the private\n2:23\nsector the right to organize and an\n2:26\nobligation on the part of the employer\n2:29\nto bargain a collective bargaining\n2:31\nagreement after the law was passed in\n2:33\n1935 elections were held across the\n2:36\ncountry in workplaces for workers to\n2:39\nchoose a union and unions were winning\n2:41\nthese elections at an extremely high\n2:44\nrate nearly 100 percent of the time\n2:46\nthat's Robert Bruno a professor of Labor\n2:48\nhistory at the University of Illinois\n2:50\nand then in the 1940s the labor movement\n2:54\nbegan to expand its organizing into the\n2:58\nSouth and they were making significant\n3:01\ngains where they were organizing new\n3:04\nmembers in the Deep South places like\n3:06\nTexas for example as a result of that\n3:11\ngrowth of the labor movement there was a\n3:13\nmovement generated by white supremacists\n3:15\nin the South connected to the business\n3:17\ncommunity\n3:18\nwho organized around the idea of passing\n3:23\nthe so-called right to work laws to try\n3:28\nto stop the labor movement from\n3:31\nexpanding into the South ultimately when\n3:34\nRepublicans took control of the United\n3:37\nStates Congress in 1946\n3:40\nhigh on their agenda was the passage of\n3:43\na Right to Work bill known as the Taft\n3:46\nHartley law while the taft-hartley ACT\n3:48\ncut off the rise of unions in the South\n3:50\nlabor continued to flourish in northern\n3:53\nstates especially in Michigan Michigan\n3:55\nwas the home of the United Auto Workers\n3:57\nand it was the efforts of the United\n4:00\nAuto Workers in the 30s and the 40s and\n4:03\nbeyond that really brought to life the\n4:06\nlabor movement the union density in\n4:09\nMichigan you know at one point we were\n4:10\n38 Union I mean you know so every for\n4:13\nevery 10 jobs there was almost 4 out of\n4:15\n10 reunions so so when I was a kid it\n4:17\nwas a big deal it was you know people\n4:19\nknew about unions they understood it my\n4:21\nfather was a firefighter he became a\n4:24\nunion president for local 366.\n4:27\nthey didn't have medical they didn't\n4:30\nhave Optical they didn't have\n4:32\nhospitalization my father fought for\n4:35\nthose and got them the union has got\n4:38\nMichigan to where they were at and then\n4:41\nin 2012 right to where it came to\n4:43\nMichigan\n4:44\n[Music]\n4:45\nthere was no no hearing there were no\n4:48\npublic availabilities they've passed the\n4:51\nentire thing in one day the governor\n4:52\nsigned it behind closed doors because\n4:55\nthey knew what they were doing was\n4:56\nincredibly unpopular the people of\n4:58\nMichigan did not want to see a change in\n5:01\nour workplace protections and our Union\n5:02\nprotections the intent was really to\n5:04\njust weaken unions and by doing that you\n5:07\nreally you're really weakening the\n5:09\nmiddle class Republicans sold right to\n5:11\nwork as a way to attract new jobs and\n5:13\nbusinesses this can be good for economic\n5:15\ndevelopment for more and better jobs\n5:16\ncoming to Michigan we've watched closely\n5:19\nwhat's going on in Indiana they've seen\n5:21\nmany more companies look at Indiana\n5:22\nciting this as one of the factors the\n5:24\nfact they did it back in February and\n5:26\nthey could have thousands more jobs in\n5:28\nthat state because they became a right\n5:29\nto work state this has not been the case\n5:32\ninstead workers have suffered as unions\n5:35\nstruggled to attract new members we were\n5:37\norganizing we just got done organizing\n5:39\nfive or six plants I mean we were we\n5:42\nwere frankly kicking ass and then then\n5:44\neverything changed that day in December\n5:47\nof 2012. I mean it literally changed\n5:50\neverything when Michigan implements uh\n5:53\nright to work and weakens worker rights\n5:56\nin the state is you see a significant\n5:59\nreduction in the average earnings and a\n6:02\nsignificant reduction in the hourly wage\n6:05\nin comparison to states that are strong\n6:09\nworker right States you see a reduction\n6:12\nin the percentage of workers that have\n6:15\nemployer paid Health Care poverty levels\n6:18\nwere a bit higher in right to work\n6:21\nstates like Michigan\n6:24\nfatality rates on the job fatality rates\n6:27\nwork significantly higher in states that\n6:32\npass right-to-work laws\nRepeal Right to Work\n6:36\nbut after 10 years workers have had\n6:38\nenough right now we get more calls than\n6:40\nwe have ever had for people wanting to\n6:42\norganize and thanks to the support of\n6:45\nworking people Democrats are back in\n6:47\ncontrol of Michigan's government oh I\n6:49\nmean I think there's no Trifecta without\n6:50\nlabor and in Michigan we haven't had a\n6:52\ntrifecta in 40 years and in those 40\n6:54\nyears we've been promising you know\n6:56\nbetter labor laws better protections for\n6:58\nworkers we've just got to make sure that\n6:59\nwe are in a position now with this new\n7:01\npower to deliver on the campaign\n7:03\npromises that we've made and one of\n7:05\nthose in my instance is repealing the\n7:07\nanti-union right to work law Gretchen\n7:09\nWhitmer she said that she's going to\n7:12\nrepeal this and I believe she will do I\n7:15\nthink that she's going to help the\n7:17\nunions big time\n7:19\nI hope that we hold her feet to the fire\n7:22\nand make sure she does\n7:26\nSenator camilleri has introduced the\n7:28\nbill to repeal the right to work law we\n7:30\nare seeing a Resurgence of Union\n7:31\nactivism not only here in Michigan but\n7:34\neverywhere in the country because we've\n7:36\nseen the power of what unions can do\n7:37\nthey can help you get better wages they\n7:39\ncan help you get better health care and\n7:40\nbetter benefits and uh folks would\n7:42\nprefer that right whether you're\n7:44\nsomebody who works at Starbucks or\n7:46\nyou're essentially having a conversation\n7:47\nat Amazon and some of the warehouses or\n7:50\neven places like Chipotle the economy\n7:52\nmight look a little different but the\n7:54\nstrength and the power of unions stays\n7:57\nthe same already the bill is under\n7:59\nattack from corporate lobbyists and the\n8:01\nright-wing think tanks that they fund I\n8:03\nmean so far we've seen organizations uh\n8:05\nthat are on the right wing of the right\n8:07\nwing Americans for Prosperity and a few\n8:10\nother groups like that that have started\n8:11\ntheir anti-campaign by all means you\n8:14\nknow let the chamber attack me for\n8:15\nhelping raise people's wages and\n8:17\nrestoring their Pension funds if they\n8:20\nwant to paint me as a bad guy for making\n8:21\nsure that working people can retire and\n8:23\nyou know have a have a dignified life\n8:26\nhave at it Michigan is on its way to\n8:28\nrepealing right to work but in States\n8:30\nacross the country workers need more\n8:32\nbargaining power not less if Michigan\n8:35\nsucceeds it would be the first state to\n8:37\nrepeal a right to work law in 60 years\n8:40\nit could set an example for other states\n8:42\nhoping to restore power to working\n8:44\npeople\n8:45\n[Music]\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: reference-wiki-pages/michigan-is-about-to-repeal-right-to-work.txt\n- **Type**: wiki\n- **Tags**: wiki, reference-wiki-pages, story\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.235Z",

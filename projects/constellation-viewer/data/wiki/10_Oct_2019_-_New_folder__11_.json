I got a lot of time here\nYeah, for sure this one because I can't be a ticket that idea\nFor June\nCould you read it? Could you read your ticket? It's an aspect of that. Your personal feeling now\nI need more extract\nMore no more in your ticket aid, I guess\nOf thinking on ten or nine. Oh, because you have you know, let me try to paint your picture actually\nWe'll go back in the water and check from the phone\nYes, you're doing part of it. I'm so excited\nYou\nSo\nI was pretty sure you added it to me when I was walking out the door and it's fine, it's\nfine, but I don't think I'm going to let that go, I'm not going to let it go, I think that's\nfine, and if I did end up leaving it out there, I think it's my personal hypothesis that they\nwould be kind enough to give back to me, because that's how most humans operate. No one acts with\nmalattent in mind. He's not going to let it go. Oh, I've got it.\nWhy is it punching?

all.\nI did that earlier, I don't know how to put it on there, I just, you know, it's slated\nbut I think we really touched it, it's the actual, you know, it should be in the game.\nYeah, I don't know.\nI just don't want to be in the game.\nYeah.\nUm.\nHmm.\nIt's gotta be in the game.\nUh-huh.\nOh my god, oh my god, oh my god.\nThat's what we pretty good about talking in this game.\nYeah.\nYou gotta do it.\nI don't know.\nAre you gonna put a pie on my yours?\nIt's yours, it's yours.\nIt's yours, it's yours.\nOh, pretty much.\nSo this is, like, I'm gonna have a walk down some drive.\nI'm not expecting that.\nYou know?\nBut, um, do you get on the game?\nDo you get on the game?\nWe have, like, characters that have one expression every time you go see them.\nYeah, they're like, they'll move along.\nThey'll jump a little bit.\nYeah, they'll have a smile.\nRight, but the arms are never represented in what they're saying.\nThey're not using the hand to express.\nThey're using it just to, I am moving.\nI remember you see, you look to be moving.\nYeah, they'll have a friend of mine.\nYeah.\nThey know random vegetables from conversation.\nThat's, that's, that's, that's so counter-intuitive language.\nCause I'm gonna say Skyrim has a function where they talk\nabout their body like this when we come up to them.\nI can't, it's like that.\nBut they'll move back to the basic, they just stand there for a minute,\nand then it repeats that one motion.\nI have a beautiful idea here.\nOkay, I know.\nYou're gonna like this.\nSo imagine, you know, sign language, right?\nMake a sign language.\nThat's used to express oneself.\nYeah.\nOkay, it's used to, it's used in a traditional means of language.\nWhat if instead, and what if there was an addition to this,\nwhich I'm just sign language in general?\nI mean, technically isn't repre-eating.\nIt's more like a, what if using American sign language\njust sign certain expressions, right?\nBut because it has that background, because it has that,\nthat initial, what do you call it?\nIt's, that's, we can start with scratch.\nWe can use symbols to express language.\nIt's just very difficult for us to use these existing terminologies\nbecause they come in some of the baggage.\nI think that also applies to sign language.\nSo what if you use the actual symbols?\nYou use the dotac symbols.\nThe ones on there, the dotac hatred.\nThe, the structure that I showed you.\nYeah, anger and anxiety and aggression.\nAnger and aggression, anger and aggression is the same anxiety\nand, uh, fear are the same.\nThere's also a middle one, who is, what was it?\nThere was anxiety.\nFear and...\nThere's anxiety and fear and strictly.\nSo you kinda want the same thing.\nI don't fancy style and say how it works.\nOr more like chat room gaming style.\nWhere they have basic stuff, circle.\nThat says you can show the emotion, it's sad.\nUm, so kind of like that.\nThat'll be in the lunch screen stuff.\nThat'll be in the, the, the sub menu, I suppose.\nUm, we're unlocking stuff.\nThere's a bit, bits of pieces of understanding the world.\nGoing forward in the mind almost.\nThere's a bit of an optional thing, fear, character, out the NPC.\nIt's supposed to be on that similar expression.\nIt's not like this thing.\nSo you use this machine train.\nAnd they're bipeds.\nThey're not human.\nThey are, you know, there are two types actually.\nThey are the unborn.\nAnd the, the, uh, egressed.\nI suppose they're higher.\nI find it better to match those two things.\nBut, um, imagine the unborn being the, these...\nThey're, they're encapsulated.\nAnd then there's other types that is fully grown.\nFrom that so-called egg over.\nImagine a...\nUm, when they talk on the experience, they don't use written language.\nThey use spoken language.\nThey use, they do use spoken language.\nBut it's not human language.\nSo it's easy for still.\nI can put dialogue out, isn't it?\nRight?\nSo, um, the main character will be a wizard or a veteran.\nAnd then you'll have to use two NPCs talking.\nOr one NPC talking.\nAnd then you'll need to express yourself one way or the other.\nAnd during the discretion, you'll be able to read their expressions.\nSo I'm reading you'll see your own flash that they had.\nYeah.\nSo imagine like, kind of back in your life.\nBut I said, it seemed to be the literal expression of these things.\nLike, the anxiety and aggression.\nAnd they're all next up.\nBut, you know what I mean?\nThey don't exact, they're like faces.\nUm, so they appear on the machine and then they can be the Dodec.\nThey can, they can, they can be, they've been edited language on these people.\nThrough their actions.\nNot through their expressions necessarily, but through the collective knowledge of that person.\nThe better you guys would know some of the more Dodecs you see.\nAnd in terms of your mind, imagine that Dodec.\nImagine that you're going inside the Dodec, right?\nAnd inside this, this, this heck of a device.\nThere are neurons per se.\nThere are bits of information.\nThere are, there are perhaps some abstraction.\nBut imagine these little points.\nAnd then people are starting to take away.\nAnd as they take away, the, the machine grows from this tiny cube to all sprouts.\nIt's bigger than they can imagine.\nThey can express itself a more intense way.\nIt's fall human.\nWe're not a human.\nThe, uh, uh, an injury to this game.\nArtificial intelligence.\nYou're building from the ground up.\nYou're building the deterministic way.\nYou're feeding information and building a human brain.\nSo imagine, um, hypothetically, imagine, they're not hypothetically.\nThey're really because this is the, it's our, it's our,\nit's our, our ideological reason.\nWe are as intelligent as we are.\nSo imagine this.\nI think they're, I'm not a scientist,\nbut I have the experience.\nI have an knowledge of the necessary to make an articulation of this.\nI have more of a, it's a more of a hypothesis, I suppose.\nBut it is what I believe to be the true nature.\nSo imagine ancient humanity.\n30,000 years ago.\n30,000 years ago.\nImagine them walking the plains of Africa.\nThey're, they're, they're by pets.\nThey're walking.\nUm, now, because we're by pets,\nbecause we are on two legs.\nUm, the birth canals of female members of the species have,\nwhat do you call it, they've gotten less,\nokay, you know, imagine this.\nSo animals, right?\nTypical animals.\nHorses and, um, these other aspects.\nHmm?\nOkay.\nSo horses, for example, they have, they have babies, right?\nAnd they're fully, they're fully thought.\nThey have picked up, not entirely new ones,\nbut a lot of them.\nThey can stand on and walk on.\nThey can be their own, once they're humans.\nWe're born dependent on our, uh, our parent tool.\nOur babies are vulnerable because they're born earlier.\nAnd that, I think my hypothesis is that,\nbecause we aren't there for born, born earlier,\nand our brains have to function at that point.\nWe have more time to develop the room for consciousness.\nNow, I have a candidate's born.\nIt's, you know, it's a relatively speaking, um,\ndamages that it's not people are healthy,\nbut I think I assume it's, one is half of it,\nbut I think it's because we shed our fur\nbecause we're being distanced from this.\nAnd then I expect fed into the idea of the,\nto the eventual conclusion of us having,\noffspring of born, one, or two years,\nbut there's a complication about that.\nI noticed this.\nI mean, it's personal, it's a year.\nSo, I don't know, I don't know.\nI don't want to treat anything.\nThat's bad, I hate you.\nThat's bad, Gwen.\nOkay, so, about 40% of births?\nNo, it's not. It's about 40%.\nNo, it's more like 80%.\nIt's 60%. 60% was another I think I gave.\nIt's a huge percentage of attempted births.\nAnd I think it's because it's this complication.\nWe wouldn't have had 200,000 years to perfect this.\nAnd because we haven't given ourselves for the time to improve the\nanswers to why we're offering.\nWe're stuck here, the evolutionary mid-between.\nOr, you know, it's not.\nI can imagine this.\nSo, I'm excited. We'll be with my arms.\nOkay, imagine.\nHe may need to develop it.\nOh, no.\nI don't want to translate.\nOh, fuck.\nOkay, got it back.\nHypothesis.\nSo, the track by which we take a human evolution,\nor evolution general is not meant to be a track of deterministic diseases.\nIt's going one way. It's a lot.\nBut anyway, the deterministic track of evolution leads us to be\nhow we are, not the best we are, best we could potentially be evolutionary speaking.\nBut the best we are given the current climate of humanity,\nthe current situation of our society.\nOkay, tangent over, Jesus Christ.\n\n\n====== REC013.txt ======\nI'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

keep some camera on my sidelines.\nIt'll, it'll probably,\nit'll take a speech.\nIt'll take a speech.\nIt'll take a speech.\nThere's a,\nthere's a lot of, huh?\nI'll put it there, it'll always be good.\nWhat are you talking about?\nIt's normally a spine.\nIt's not a brain, it's not a spine,\nit's not a brain, it's not a spine,\nit's not a spine, it's not a spine.\nYeah, let's say that.\nBut,\noh no.\nYeah, you put some camera on my waist a lot,\nand then it's supposed to be,\nreally good, but it's so hard,\nthat they hurt now.\nI can tell it doesn't come off.\nYeah, I tell them,\nthey're like,\nnot too hard,\nso it's not one like,\nso tickling, right?\nYeah.\nIt's like you're a computer,\nbut it's one of the deep ones.\nYou can't think of yourself, right?\nSo,\nI can say that myself.\nBut,\nhuh?\nI can't find myself,\nbut I can say that myself.\nYeah, that's all I said really well.\nYou can't do that.\nSo,\nI know, I won't make this up there.\nSo, I don't have,\nlike,\nhumanity,\nchildren, you know?\nI'm glad you're here.\nI told you,\ntickling is the way of producing that.\nAnd,\nyou know,\nmaking sure the child stays calm.\nI think that,\nour parents have forgotten the tickling,\nbecause of the important part,\nit sounds funny,\nit sounds bizarre,\nbut,\nif you're here,\ntickling is one of the aspects,\nhe says,\nclose,\nhe says,\ngood.\nAnd,\nbecause the social background,\nI'm not saying,\nyou're perfectly okay to that.\nThat,\nthe social background,\nthe background of,\nhumanity,\nyou know?\nAnd,\nyou know,\nI'm not mentioning,\nall culture,\nthe United States is talking,\nthe U.S.\nhave got,\ngot,\ngot,\ngot,\ngot,\ngot,\ngot,\ngot,\ngot,\ngot.\nI don't know.\nI just really wanted to\neat that,\nin the video

this.\nThe axis.\nYou're just sitting here on the shoulder.\nThree hits.\nI'll just walk here.\nWell, cause I close very long way.\nYeah, but it's like a program.\nYeah, but it doesn't change the fact.\nWe bring out a lot of water with us.\nIt's like wearing fur.\nI like the little fur thing on the head.\nYeah, 10.\nIf you are getting over...\nNo, it shouldn't be cool.\nIt's a cool body type.\nReady?\nGo outside.\nCool, off like a button.\nThat way to feel better.\nYeah, just to start playing with them.\nIs it cold water outside?\nYeah, it should be.\nI mean, there's shoots in the relative area.\nIt's cold.\nOh, yeah, this.\nHey, you should have been out on it.\nHe's had a lovely video.\nSo there's a channel over there.\nYeah.\nIt's a person.\nYeah.\nWhat's that?\nOh!\nIt looks

though.\nJust a matter of time.\nI think I'm going to start focusing on sculpting, though.\nThat's not the idea.\nI'm not sure about that.\nI started trying to sculpt again, too.\nWhat's your mind to

they mentioned it really well so.\nThat's how you're talking?\nYeah, that's how I talk.\nYeah, that's how you talk with them, thanks a lot.\nHonestly, it doesn't really part, it is not that bad for her.\nJust as good as that, you get along with the grind in nursing places.\nThere's so much, works from that to the smile, but just sort of like,\nboth of them are like, the way you can show them

year?\nOkay.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nYay.\nI found it.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nI'll go over that too.\nThat lovely.\nDo you want me to give you the things that come out of it?\nNo.\nLet me show it to people from finance businesses.\nTry it.\nOkay.\nOh.\nOh, no.\nIt's a comfortable one.\nYou can manage it.\nI don't know, it's comfortable for me, I need to be at home.\nCan I have a cup of coffee?\nHuh?\nMy father had a cup of coffee, so...\nTime for coffee, so...\nRight.\nAnyway, so I'm having a snack time.\nYou should be very, very, very long, very...\nYou know, I'm not... I think to say...\nIt's very, very, very, very mature, you know, things like that.\nBut I think that they should allow...\nMore...\nIt's half a time new, not about the dancing, but I like that they want to sound like...\nNo, but...\nJust a quick dance.\nI'll try to get...\nWith the wine, with the calm, with the beautiful dances, do the props.\nSo, at all, right?\nBut it's less...\nThe music and...\nThe music can handle itself in forms and dancing.\nAnd I feel like that...\nAnything you find brilliant, or different, that's what I think.\nThe mushrooms, that's all from different dance.\nIt's just...\nRice...\nYou might as well buy them, and it's...\nIt's less, it's less, uh, obesity or social.\nI think that if you approach them a lot, the...\nHave a picture or if you're approaching them.\nIt easier is to be...\nHonestly expressive to you a lot.\nAnd I feel...\nA lot of social barriers...\nHave prevented that process.\nSo, I imagine...\nIt's not just a time, it's not just...\nIt's a great city for adults.\nYou imagine...\nNot in time, but it's in time, it's in time, it's in time.\nIt's in time, right?\nPeople who...\nOh, yeah.\nI don't know, but people who...\nThey can't enough to see that state village.\nSmall social spaces even...\nThat's in time, it's in time.\nIt's in time, it's all about...\nBetter to trick them out.\nThat happens.\nYou're very right.\nAnd they're all...\nEveryone there knows each other, also, the rock-horse.\nAnd...\nIn Europe, it went the way of...\nPeople got more and more separate,\nthrough, you know, these kind of times.\nThey're looking in Japan in a different way.\nBecause there's...\nSo...\nThere's not much hope in the states.\nSo they're looking at constraining them on social.\nThey're...\nBut they don't expand the hope in them, so...\nI don't know...\nLike, these aren't theirs.\nHmm?\nCan I plan on the job of pants or anything else?\nYeah.\nBut I imagine, okay, so...\nFor the spots...\nThe upper parts...\nThe...\nAreas that should be social?\nThe parts.\nYou have...\nYou should have areas of science.\nYou should have areas of philosophy, areas...\nWhich should...\nThe...\nYou can go on.\nI mean, I think that...\nYou can find where once you get the states to come out and...\nThe social states...\nFrom hard, and I'm not exactly sure,\nBut the social states is...\nThe...\nThe darkness.\nThe urban areas.\nThe blockways.\nThe parts.\nThe heavens.\nThe fear of the cross.\nThe spots.\nThis is...\nThis is the social states.\nAnd there is a...\nThe green.\nThat's kind

states.\nYou know, to try to figure out what they're talking about,\nThat's the ideal size.\nAnd I think they have the single state.\nThe human state.\nThe human state.\nWe have a...\nThe person's guess.\nWe have a hope.\nWe have a lot of belief in things.\nWe have a hope.\nWe have a hope.\nAnd that's good too.\nI think that the bedroom in the other side\nit's kind of pulled your social state\nand the public's social state.\nRight?\nThe living room, I think it's...\nThat's the uh...\nThe other part of it.\nYou can't figure out where to make it, right?\nBecause I don't know how good it is for the states to be.\nI think that's the only way that the second would face it when we...\nWhat's my problem?\nBetween the mission.\nNo, no.\nIt's a very tangling like...\nIf they had a group, the higher it is, the more people will be able to do it themselves.\nThe colors of us, the roads of us, you should be, you should have less vehicles for trying to fly,\nand more vehicles for trying to

making people go to the higher.\nYou can see how the visual stress is expressed in the intention.\nSo, the impression, you know, the fact that I've been in Japan for a while,\nthat it's that structure

rational.\nExcept actually, especially when you see a lot of our abilities,\nbecause it's professional.\nYou need to go to the other side of the city.\nYou need to go to the other side of the

suppose.\nI hope it's, I hope it's, we're pretty common back then, surprisingly. We've gotten more and more repressive.\nOkay, so, in that tangent to where, not a apostasy, not murder, not...\nInfact, yeah, that's, that would be the, probably a term because men got jealous, men get, what do you call it?\nNow, they get insecure. The insecure feeling is what drives them to suppress women's rights, suppress women's ability to express themselves back then.\nAnd that's why there's, there's consequences that have led up to this day. It's insecurity. It's insecurity back then.\nAnd, you know, 500,000 years ago, 300,000 years ago, insecurity is intended to...\nOkay, so you're doing the honeymoon period, right? About 12 months. 12 months, ultimately, socially, biologically.\nBiologically, behaviorally, those 12 months are almost entirely correlated with the birth length.\nRemember, you have, you have nine months of gestation, and then three months, just to get the baby on their feet, I guess.\nNot, not on their feet, typically, but, like, healthy enough to where it survives. Like, it's good enough. It'll survive, just fine.\nBecause it has enough nutrients and stuff. But, after that 12 months, honeymoon period is over, you know, around there.\nAnd when it could be nine months, actually, it could be less longer, I don't know. About 12 months is there, like, the cultural factor there.\nAnyway, so anxiety leads into that. Because it's not only you, not you, Jesus.\nBeing women may be like men into keeping around.\nKeeping them... The ones they are attracted to, the ones they want to be with, the ones they are currently flanking.\nThe ones they are... Yeah, you can attach them. That's not a bad thing, typically. It's just the equivalent of human behavior.\nSo, and anxiety leads into that too. The nails inside, because they're wanting to repress, they're wanting to keep producing more offspring.\nAnd you move toward... Jesus, I keep saying you. Women move to typically in biology and in paper, they move toward wanting more offspring.\nWanting more, does they attach, trying to attach the offspring? And they... I mean, it could be actually, I don't know. They don't have to do it.\nI don't know. That's interesting. So, if they don't want it, do I have it?\nI mean, it could want it. I see another woman with babies and the ideal babies. What is that?\nTo you, what is your desire for children? You had it, your act of desire. What was the desire for your children to cheer for them?\nWell, it was intentional, so it was mostly just, I wanted that size.\nSo, you want to... Yeah, not for active children, just for the sake of being born. Yeah, that makes sense.\nThat's what I meant.\nAnd because of that, I got pregnant.\nSo, in biology, you know, women have awareness, men have awareness, but typically we hide awareness in our culture.\nBut, like, it works out like how with that person, the more release of whatever it causes to get that, like...\nAnd the birthplace, the rush of that, because you get behind, you get that they attach more face, like the new obsessive kind of face.\nYeah, like I do with you.

I come back.\nSo you don't worry about your shoulder combat.\nYou know what you should skip it?\nI hate like some of the combat.\nWhen it gets to a point where it's like overkill for my characters than I'm like...\nYou know what she was like.\nIt was combat that wasn't that is crowded, you know?\nA little more sparse.\nWell, even though it's a car and I'm getting money out of it, which is good because I need the money.\nOr, like, buying stuff in the game.\nLike, pushing the money.\nSo, it's a little more worth it.\nWhat should I eat?\nWell, it's delicious.\nI'm gonna go with that...\nThat one.\nWhich one?

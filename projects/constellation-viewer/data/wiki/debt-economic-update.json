We do so with an eye toward the\ndebt of various nations around the world and then we'll take a look at consumer debt\nto do so. We're pleased again and honored to have with us Professor of Economic Emeritus\nat Richard Wolf, who joins us from our New York Studios Professor. Happy New Year, welcome back.\nHappy New Year to you and I'm glad to be here. So, you know, I had we had a guy on Professor\nthat was three, four months ago. He has not been on the show since because I ask him about debt.\nHe said, well, debt doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Again, it hasn't been on the show since.\nBut why does debt matter and does who controls the debt or owns the debt? Does that matter, Professor?\nWell, I could not be more clear. Debt matters enormously because what it means is some people,\nthe borrowers, have an obligation and they have an obligation to take whatever money they get,\nhowever they get it and not spend it on goods and services, but shift it over to other people\nwho are the lenders and that affects everything about how an economy works. Governments who are\nbig borrowers in the world economy typically do so because politicians find it easier for their\nown development and their own success to borrow money from the people they would otherwise have to\ntax. In other words, excuse me, to take an example from the United States, last December we'd\ngave an enormous tax cut to corporations and the rich. Then the government, not getting that money\nanymore from them, had during 2018 to find the money some other way. It borrowed the money\nthat it needed to have to make its expenditures and ironically it borrowed a good bit of the money\nfrom the corporations and rich people whose taxes it had lowered. So it ended up with an obligation\nto pay all those people back plus interest whereas if it had not done so, had taxed them originally\nin December the way it should have otherwise, it wouldn't have a debt. So the notion that it doesn't\nmatter misunderstands the enormous impact that debt has on every country, on every corporation and on\nevery family that turns to that experience as part of its financial life. I want to get to some\ngraph in a moment guys but first professor I want to just back up just a little bit. So when you say\nthat the U.S. then lent the was loan the money from these companies that got the tax cut,\nthat reminds me you know people would also say well and then China holds U.S. debt. What you're\nactually saying and make sure that I'm correct on this professor is that somebody else is holding\nour bonds, our treasury notes. So when we say either these companies like you just said or we say\nChina holds a debt, what you mean is that they are buying our bonds, is that correct?\nThat's right and all of bond is is what we used to call an IOU, a good set of letters because it\nmeans that the United States government, let's take the example you gave of China, the United States\ngovernment didn't want, couldn't get its way around, taxing its own companies, its own wealthy\npeople. I won't say the mass of people because we already overtaxed them in this country anyway but\nit won't tax corporations in the rich and what it does instead is not only borrow from them\nbut also borrow from other countries if the other countries are willing to lend. It's ironic\nfor Americans to understand that the United States is the biggest debtor country in the world\nand the people's Republic of China is the biggest creditor of the United States in the world.\nSo that means every year and this is really important. Tens of billions of dollars of American\ntaxpayer money paid to the government is used by the United States government not to provide\nschools or hospitals or roads but simply to pay interest to the people's Republic of China\nwhich receives this financial benefit every year even as the politicians make statements critical\nof China we as a nation because of those politicians decisions are funding the people's Republic\nof China. Well it's a good thing professor that they don't have either the Chinese or the\ncorporations latitude to hike our interest rates because we give this or that terrible tweet or say\nsomething nasty about them. I want to shift and talk about the global business where a global\nbusiness finance program so let's look around the world at debt as a share of gross domestic product\nand the chart we have here shows the percentage of debt versus GDP since 2007 and it shows Japan and\nthe U.S. and the U.K. as sort of the leaders with a high debt to GDP ratio in Germany as a low debt\nas a share of GDP what's your take on these numbers professor? Well you know the answer is pretty\nsimple when the global capitalist system crashed in 2008 many governments particularly for example\nthe United States the United Kingdom and Japan among others rushed in to try to prevent that\ncrash of the stock markets from becoming another great depression and the way they did that was to\npump money into the economy and to drop interest rates that in turn stimulated every potential borrower\nevery politician who borrows money for the government every corporate executive who borrows\nmoney for their company they now took advantage of these low interest rates to borrow like there\nwas no tomorrow because it was cheap to do that and for a while that gave a kind of artificial\ndebt boost to the economy the problem is those chickens are coming home to roost now we now have\nan economy with problems with an overhang of all of this accumulated debt here's the irony the\nlast crisis of capitalism in 2008 was handled by dropping interest rates and pumping up debt\nwe are now going into another one in 2019 or 20 when the big question is how much will that\noverhang of debt make the next downturn as bad or maybe even worse than the one we just barely\nemerged from a professor we're out of time but I want to have you back I hope you'll come back\nin the next few days maybe next week and talk about consumer debt we wanted to get to that but\nI didn't want to interrupt you because you were hitting on all these important points we thank you\nso much professor Richard Wolf professor of economics of America's University of Massachusetts\nthank you happy new year again take care you too\n\n--------------------\n\nWe spoke about debt by nation and today we take a quick view of US consumer debt and at G7\ndisposable income before talking about income in the quality highlighted by those yellow\nvest protesters in France.\nTo do so, we are pleased and honored to once again be joined by Professor Emeritus, University\nof Massachusetts.\nAmherst Professor Richard will professor great to see you again.\nThank you, Bob.\nGlad to be here.\nSo, Americans now owe more than ever.\nConsumer debt, which takes in credit cards and personal and student loans, is over\nfour trillion bucks this year.\nAt the same time, mortgage levels are nearly as high as they were before.\nThe housing crisis, we're just talking about the Great Recession, with homeowners\nowing 10.3 trillion bucks in the most recent data.\nThat's up by 2.8% year over year.\nThese seem like pretty horrific numbers to me, but you're the economist professor.\nWhat do they mean to you?\nWell, they're pretty scary and I think you don't need to be an economist to know that\nif you have not learned the lesson of the last credit collapse, the subprime mortgage collapse\nwe used to call it back in 2008 and 2009, you should, because these numbers indicate\nthat even if people learn the lesson, the fact is that the incomes of most Americans\nand this is true in other countries too, simply did not go up over the last decade,\nwhile the cost of leading a decent life, getting your kids a college education if possible,\nhaving a vacation once in a while, cost more, your income didn't go up,\nand your solution, even if you were worried, was to borrow more money.\nAnd again, the basic law of economics.\nIf your underlying income is not going up, but your debt levels are,\nit's only a matter of when, not whether that you're going to hit crunch time\nand the economy is going to crack because people can't keep going,\nthey can't even service the debt they have, and so they can't buy goods and services,\nand then we have the crash.\nIt's a horrific feeling for some of us.\nIt's like being on a train rushing towards a stone wall, everybody sees it,\nbut seems unable to take the steps to prevent the disaster.\nIt's almost like a death spiral, and it reminds me it's been a long time since a URI,\nprobably watched Sesame Street, but you know, you have all these things that look the same,\nincreasing housing, increasing transportation, increase health care,\nbut income's not increasing.\nWhich thing does not look like the other, and its income, as you say.\nBut I want to take a look at the wider world, at least at the G7 countries,\nprofessor, in terms of disposable income.\nIf it were like the old school G8, which included Russia,\nRussia would actually be at lowest in terms of disposable income.\nBut of the current G7 members, when we look at this chart,\nactually Canada, and the UK citizens, have more disposable income,\nItaly, the lowest, and in the middle of the pack, Germany, the US, and Japan,\nand France.\nWhat do you make of these numbers of household debt?\nAgain, I think they're frightening.\nI think what we're seeing is the grudgingly more and more people are loading up\nwith one or another kind of debt.\nI think that behind many of the political events of our time is the anxiety of people\nwho don't see rising incomes, but do see rising debts.\nAnd that's a very depressing situation.\nI think it lies in part behind the anger of the British people to vote against\nstaying in Europe, which isn't going to solve their problem.\nIt's behind the anger of the American people, voting for Trump,\nwhich isn't going to solve their problem.\nAnd in France, you see it with this yellow vest movement,\nbecause they've made it crystal clear that the combination of weak income,\nno future, and rising debts is what brings them into the street.\nI think you're seeing the building of a kind of pressure cooker in which debt\nis playing a very central role in galvanizing people's uneasiness\nabout where their economies are taking them.\nWell, let's move to that, because you know, when it...\nIt's not just the U.S. I mean, we've got some specific problems we've spoken about in the U.S.\nBut, you know, income inequality is a problem, the world over.\nAnd I just wonder if this circumstance with the yellow vest protesters in France\nis really a microcosm of a movement that might be beginning.\nYou know, it started with just a couple of issues.\nNow it really seems to have emerged professor into more income inequality overall.\nDo you think as those figures and that they have, that they have nots\nand one thing doesn't seem like the other, as those continue to exacerbate,\nare we going to theme more of this, do you think?\nThe more of these protests, more of these concerns by average folks\nwho've just sort of mad as hell and not going to take it anymore?\nI'm convinced that you are already seeing it.\nThere have been yellow vests in Belgium.\nThere has been a sizable yellow vest movement in the Netherlands.\nIt is already major news across Europe.\nBut I don't think it's going to stop not only because it's already some evidence of it.\nI think that there is a combination of building anger and rage from below\nand a level of being out of touch with it at the top that promises more trouble.\nLet me give you one illustration.\nThis morning, in France, Mr. Macron, the president,\nnamed a woman minister who would run the debate that he's called for\nover the issues raised by the yellow vest movement,\nmostly issues about the mass of the French people not having enough money to live a decent life.\nThe newspapers in France this morning published the income that would be earned by the minister\nwho would lead this discussion, a woman who, by the way, has already resigned.\nHer income was to be in the neighborhood of 200,000 US dollars, the equivalent.\nOkay, that is so crazy.\nThat is so insulting to the mass of the French people that it will stimulate more yellow vest.\nIt's so outrageous, it kind of boggles the mind.\nBut it suggests the inability of those sitting at the top to even understand\nthe most basic reality motivating those at the bottom.\nAnd that's a sign of a lot of trouble coming down the pike.\nProfessor, before we go and ask you one other question,\nI apologize, this sort of comes out of left field.\nI know you're not a political analyst, but you're just as good as anybody else if not better.\nSo you think about Catalonia, you think about Brexit, you think about Donald Trump in the US.\nAnd I wonder if these movements, political movements, if you will,\nwhere people have just said, we've had enough.\nAre they, do you think, a reflection also of this inequality gap?\nOr do you think there's something different?\nNo, I'm convinced it's the inequality gap.\nLook, here's the way I make sense of it.\nDealing with the inequality gap puts you right up against the capitalist economic system that we live with.\nIt is very scary, especially after half a century of Cold War,\nto think, let alone act around the notion that the economic system you've accepted and lived with\nis what has to change, what maybe even has to go, because of the inequality.\nSo people look for something else that they can change in the hope,\nvain, I believe, but in the honest hope that maybe if we're British and we get out of Europe,\nor maybe if we're American and we don't let refugees and immigrants from Central America in,\nor if we're in Hungary and we don't let desperate people from Syria in,\nthat change will deal with what upsetting us.\nIt won't, it'll take a few years before that's clear to people,\nbut I think these are what we call displacements of an economic problem,\ninequality, our economic system, but there are still enough people scared of dealing with that issue\nthat they look for something else they can change in the kind of almost mystical hope\nthat getting out of Europe or blocking the border or something like that\nwill get them back to some sort of economic equilibrium.\nIt won't, we've been there, we've done that, it's too little and it's too late.\nYou've got to deal with the economic problem because in the end, that's the problem that we have to solve.\nWell, we're going to continue to talk about it.\nWe so much appreciate your assistance in that regard.\nProfessor Richard, well, thank you, Professor, appreciate it.\nThank you, I'm glad to do it.\n\n--------------------\n\nThis is Richard Wolf from Democracy at Work, responding to another Ask Prof Wolf question\nfrom our Patreon community.\nThis question comes from Mir Usman, and it asks about the so-called debt trap of the situation\nthat particularly afflicts countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, but elsewhere\ntoo, in which special problems they have, like COVID-19, or long-term economic development\nproblems they have had for decades, put them in a position of having to borrow money.\nAnd they borrow money, usually from countries who give foreign aid or from banks who are\ndoing this to make money.\nThis kind of use of credit to help a country solve its problems is as old as capitalism,\nmaybe even a little bit older, before capitalism, when banks did this too.\nAnd it has a terrible habit of growing forever.\nFirst the bank borrows for assuming the country borrows from the bank for a particular project,\nbut then it has an additional problem.\nEven more often the borrowers are political people, the government of a country, and they\nuse a part of the loan to be politically successful in their country, with only the rest of it\ngoing to help develop the country.\nAnd that doesn't generate enough growth to pay off the loan.\nAnd who then has to do it, the mass of people.\nSo now the debt becomes a social problem.\nAnd with all the other economic development problems in what we used to call the third world,\nhaving to pay debt to a foreign bank is just an additional one.\nAnd when it becomes difficult to do it, well, you go back and you borrow even more money\nto pay off the debt you weren't able to pay before.\nYou put all these things together.\nAnd third world countries, as we used to call them, developing countries, we call them\nnow, are constantly struggling with debt and never more so than now.\nKeep in mind that when you read that the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates here in\nthe United States, many of those countries have borrowed and have to refinance at a higher\ninterest rate, costing them even more money that they don't have.\nAnd Mir Usman says, how do we get out of this?\nIs there a way to get out of it?\nDo the country sometimes tax their own people to help pay for these loans that have accumulated?\nThe answer is, most of the time, they defer maintaining their roads to use the money to\npay off the debts.\nThey're like desperate people who are loaded up with too much debt and are then tempted\nto borrow even more to get through the interest payments they have to make now.\nIs there then an escape?\nI'm afraid the answer is yes, it is.\nThere is one, but you have to face the politics of it because that's the core issue.\nMost of the countries in debt have leading elite groups, corporations, big businesses,\nlocal and foreign and wealthy people.\nAnd much of the economic borrowing that the country did was because it did not have the\npolitical strength, the political background, the political will to tax those in their\nsociety who really could pay foreign and domestic corporations and the local rich.\nAs long as you don't do that, you're going to be confronting debt problems.\nThat's part of what it means to be a third world country.\nAnd the irony of history has been those countries who refuse to play the game, who were\nostracized because they refused to play the game.\nBecause the ultimate threat to the little third world country in Asia, Africa and Latin\nAmerica is if you don't pay off the past debts, we won't give you anymore.\nAnd then what will you do?\nYour own people will throw you out of office because you weren't able to get the debt\nto build the dam, to fix the roads, to recover from the hurricane, whatever it was.\nAnd very few countries have the political will.\nSo the irony is, if you're shut off for other reasons, you may discover almost by accident\nthat in the long run, you're better off not borrowing and relying on your own resources.\nAnd the best example in the world right now is the people's Republic of China.\nHaving made a communist revolution in 1949, they were cut off from credit.\nThe way most socialist and communist countries were.\nAnd they had to do it on their own.\nAnd they went after their rich people.\nThat was part of what their revolutions were about.\nAnd they raised the resources from inside and ended up with a better story of working\ntheir way out of the underdevelopment than all those countries that are relied on all\nthose debts, all those years.\nSo yes, there is a way out, but you need to have strong, mass-based political leaders\nwith the will to say no, to solve the problems not only internally, but with help of countries\nlike China who have their own reasons to help you to get out of the trap.\nThere is that way, but it is as so often a fundamentally political issue.\nIf discussions like these strike you as valuable

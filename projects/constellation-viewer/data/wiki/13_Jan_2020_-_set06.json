They're not the same one.\nAll these pieces of animation are tied to one system.\nThey're out of force.\nThat sounds just don't interrupt.\nThe time when that's been made for this.\nSo this is their tracks, they're nails, they're uppusses,\nall the players in the world are all around.\nBut they're really cool.\nThe one player that interacts with anyone, wherever it is.\nThere it is, I'll never disassemble it.\nI don't know, I'll figure it out.\nFirst player.\nOne with the story of the time.\nOne with the other with the whole time during itself.\nNo, four player max.\nKeep their own together.\nEncouraging or sitting together.\nAnd around characters.\nAnd they know that one.\nYeah, that way it's not so confusing.\nWe get to 12 now.\nSix.\nCharacters.\nFive.\nSix.\n\n\n====== REC011.txt ======\nSo you and five of the players in this lunch game, you can explore together.\nThere's a timeline for the NPCs.\nI can relax for five minutes. It's easy here.\nFive of the players are gonna run down, right? What's night?\n\n\n====== REC012.txt ======\nI can't work on the audio, get them, get them, get them, get the audio, audio, audio\nI'm working in a place that needs to be established a world-wide, water-full volume that's always coming\nbut it's very common, it's very soft because it's very far away from very good pressure\n\n\n====== REC013.txt ======\nform it first, simple figure, biped, can walk. I eventually they'll be able to run and\nthen climb and leap and navigate the world and eventually they don't lock other means\nin navigation. The moment they hit the water, the first time a large pool of water, the\nbig tentage round in, they sink, it gets dark, pressure starts to build, and the\ndotac it heats up and becomes waterborne and you hold your normal running button, which\nwould be R2, in this case, and you prepare yourself for it really fast across the water.\n\n\n====== REC014.txt ======\nSo, I've got a little more told you about this.\nGo ahead side with the gold too, and figure out what player to do together.\nNow that I have established that glove as possible, thank you to Ops. God damn it, it was awesome.\n\n\n====== REC015.txt ======\nI've got to stop scared tomorrow.\nImagine.\nImagine a crystal in the structure, but it's more of a\nunending as it first do.\nLike a\nsurface with a lot of holes.\nThe molecules, the shapes, and the shapes are\nthe body, really.\nThey might be the body, but they were\ninteresting shape.\nIt's not human, but it's\nbeautiful, right?\nIt's a wonderful shape.\nIt's wonderful for four.\nIt's triangular, but not bad.\nIt's such an easily notion.\nLook at that trend.\nIt's as arbitrary as everything else.\nIt's good for generalizing.\n\n\n====== REC016.txt ======\nHow can I add physics to the IK on that character model?\nDo I just choose physics on there?\nSo, physical bodies.\nI like to want to spring.\nHere's the character jumps up and grabs something.\nThe character's kind of wobble and feels the movement.\nThey can see more physical because they more, they see more tactile.\nI need to combine those controllers.\nOh, it's funny.\n\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/13_Jan_2020_-_set06.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, character-design, story\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.026Z",

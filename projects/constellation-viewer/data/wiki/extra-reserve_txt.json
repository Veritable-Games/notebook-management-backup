But for sake of teaching these mechanics?\n\nFather is a fiction. If Mother has grounding she is earth and Nature wrapped in one. The thing of father is time; say that- Father is not time but thing of Fortune then he may speak to it most literally; give anyone whom would ask the thing of the world's would-be knowledge. ⁠Unknown should be grounded to an idea that they are so a apart of life's beginnings; inheritors of something so well-known to all of us. The thing of humanity is so interesting and if Nature ties us to eachother, than the [most-literal] character of Fortune is the idea of our shared knowledge in our so-given history- these givings of what we are in some unreconcilable wording.\n\niterations, I'm still editing here. but the thing of Time is a literal fiction; so-be the \nthing of that 'father' figure to detatch the idea of this role to another thing I tho\n-ught of Fortune as the stand-in. Use of 'they' will be best.\n\nThe idea of Fortune already present works well. If we are given fortunes in the things \nof our shared humanity; then these strange inequitable abundances. I want to help \npeople imagine a world bettered by the ideals of this one.\n[3:15 PM]Glitch: Writing more.to give this thing block of text coherence...\n\n'Mother' as Nature and the earth works perfectly well in our connection to everything. She is 'real' for all intents of the narrative.\n\nFortune is to be best-described with great recognition to all our [real] problems. ⁠extra-reserve. What we may have instead of this thing of our variegated- inheritance of wealth- help see that we ought not to [want heedlessly] in our seen abilities to other. We need not more saved if it is at the expense of greater good. ⁠Unknown The thing of economy is so severe in its damage, most-often broken things of want; but the thing most often recognized is our wanting need of other people. Life goes on as it may and Fortune will always behold unto us that 'we' are not enough. Wanton greed may otherwise be bestowed to others.\n\nWe should recognize good Fortune, but see our-living but fact in the realities of nature and life.\n\nI've too many ignorances to say son more so-literally on these issues. I can only hypothesize and do basic proofs. These ideals of mine are so-attached to the writing. I want to give my best insights from to what we know so that more people see our freedom in the thing I'd say [we need]; this well-seen idea, want unified by all shared human value. [...] [To better recognition of humanity might be for itself]\n\nWe need a sort of right to life for the 'I' and all those others.\n\n'Fortune' will matter most in the people's connection to the forest. 'Mother' will be will thing of willing gratitude; of than-king the earth, Nature; our good [variegated] Fortune as humans. \n\n[..] The thing of time does not exist-\nThis thing of Knowledge goes in so disparate and awesome ways. (how does one discern good knowledge from bad? what is aligned to the real?)\n\nThis writing goes to ⁠Unknown; and my other writings & works-\n\nThese things of language go a lot of ways in good utility; these ideas are good, I must give my best writing to them in way of what we might build in our [most-underutilized potential among others]. We are producing enough, our societies have incredible abundances we could only think to keep relegated to our so-nations and then states; to governances and their often-far-representation of those people who would see their office. We do not see to the best care of people in how our 'economy' sets us to operation. Abundance is good if we all have what we would need- but people do not. \n\nWe don't have equity among all others so we must maintain that these fables are made with an ignorant falsity of the things that would hold power over us. [insanity] We ought to know how we might do better for ourselves and those others.\n\n[...]\n\nWriting goes nowhere if it is not applied to something we would all reco-\ngnize as readily beneficial for us. I don't know what all this will amount to \nyet. I do not have a plan. Autumn should not come from my own mind. \n\nThe thing of these- far absurd letters is that I might be able to contribute \nsomething to my time here; we are not so alone, the earth will be here for-\never, despite our neglect- until the sun is so-determined to exhume it \nto space; we must see to it that [so much is amended on] before we might \nbuild [in good conscience] to our greatest imaginings. \n[..]\n[5:13 PM]Glitch: The thing of music can do a lot for us. Our ties to it vary in so many ways. I could not give easy insight to it, but the thing of our nature related to music]to it is most interesting to me. We have expectations of music that find us to sways of felt connection to a thing we listen to. To keep us motivated may keep us held in focus to the present in variegated ways- the focus that comes with time to the things that keep sound to our emotive & thus, our relational-workings \n\nTo ⁠Unknown I heard it once said that you should aim for 80% commonly understood, and 20% novel; more to say, the thing of best creation goes with experience forms our expectations; our 'hearing' of words in correlation to what we've been exposed to in culture. What we make in way of art and design will give composers the best insight. I don't think I'd like to use music in an overtly-explicit way. We are not manipulate a player's attention; given apart in the systems that would give them operation of the game; they may set their own interests for engagement. Otherwise we are not giving them best-learned experience for detachment from themes in bad music or strangeness in pace'; may be oddities of expected melody, rhythm, \n\nA piece may speak to you in a particular way. If our emotional ties to music on our history to it do all they may for us because of its difficult to parse draws from our language and all our shared things of feeling. We may hold the self to much greater recognition in well-affecting music. Our hearing of emotionally-aligned, familiar, yet novel instrumentation and voice gives us this greater hold to our hearts; —poorly-relational; and often-bad music will not hold our sway. \n\nThese pieces may carry us places unexpected. [..] A good piece of music will find a reason by our internalized-workings. To the wonderous things of emotion which will carry us into deep thoughts and given weight to our wants to express. Give this time to talking among others or to dance and you may find even stronger ties to the thing; so-given those in present witness to it are in good relation and turn to it. To say on why we find contentedness in music is difficult. We may only find thematic weight for music's production when the world and its themes are grounded in a ways that are readily apparent.\n\nTo list things isn't to bring the novelty of language into one's ears. If sound says anything about a space or what we say; it is of incredible importance. The things of speech go in great recognition to music and we may not be able to say-enough on why. I could not put forward a thesis on it; if anyone would have an idea on proofs to read to, I would be so-curious-\n\nIf music carries us anywhere; if our speech takes us to places of reason in our minds- great music carries stories; [its definitely not a finished thesis, my bad] [iteration is something most-necessary. \n\nI hate to disappoint so much] quoted, to a friend: \"The thing of harmony between players in a piece. \n\nIf I have ideas (characters could play in almost-behaved unison to the thing of music) Give characters talent their own instruments.\"\n\nto my very nascent ideas on sound\nStrictly speaking, 'sound-design' and 'world-ambience'; what we would expect from the soundscape, ambience, & music of a game world. These details that bring it to life in way of physics and interaction- for how you put yourself to the game,\n[6:00 PM]Glitch: Of our project dubbed ‘Autumn’:\nIf this [project] ends up as an inadvertent inclusion of my thesis, I would only be more-greatly indebted to your effort. As I go on though, we can [go on] to build Autumn. I’ve the ambition to see it as something that might help me say more on this odd philosophical proof; a working-hypothesis I’ve been writing out on the channel. People are capable of incredible things, and I think it’s through this project I may afford people an idea on how they may give better. \n\nOf Ego and original sin; \nthe machinations of these values we are so ascribed at birth; of learned behaviors gained through facets of environment, nutrition, our-bodies; nurture from people, of attention, want for the self, of others that we would be-driven to know. A lie is but something not [reconciled] to ourselves; likely against the values of others.\n\nOf Guilt & Shame (needs much amendment and clarity)\nIf the systems of operational hierarchy persist in our minds, we order ourselves in reversal of the forward; put ourselves out, say we are not wanted (in a way), then put forward the thought (or action—though [this] may-be inhibited; the forwarding to ask of another is how we ground ourselves to each other. Then, if we [endure] to set ourselves too far apart it goes to confusion, malice, distrust, and all the things that come with not understanding the 'other' that would endure against the will of our minds. Do people fear, feel shame, guilt, and depression out of what people and their own internalized [systemic-workings] would want of them? Of the things that would tie them to their [values]? We 'fear' against our own knowledge in opposition to the built-in systems of [wanting] belief in oneself and our [deterministic] comparison to others. If I feel my values are so-good, I will have no shame. \n\nSo what is this feeling of depression?\n\nOf all Nature’s drivers born-unto us\nwe are consequently doing [amendments] of what goes [from these] internalized systems—everything which affects us; these [inherited] things of felt|shared relation and values which force-us comparison. Where is there any order at all for [our] behavior to move, to take a step coming from?\n\nFalse things on intelligence and standing\nIntelligence is not something anyone has; knowledge, experience, and trauma goes a ways; but the mind works to do incredible things if we can [develop] enough of relation to ourselves among others in our lives. If there is a set [separation of order] in how we do things moment to moment; as in language, then it would reason that there are still such hierarchies of [relational-draws] that are afforded to those people that would-be in our lives. \n\nOf amendment against Pride & Jealousy\nand ‘wanting’; these of our most selfish drivers endure to affect us; amend that which goes on to relate ourselves to others, all in ways that would hold us to the Ego and those enduring values. pride for what reason do we need to go forward on things; even despite [my own] betters?\n\nIf we are to ‘amend unto acts’ of beneficience, and do-so rightly we [must-know] ourselves and [imagine] a brighter, wholly-optimistic idea of how these systems of knowledge, language, rhetoric, relation, soliloquy, and then the weird anomaly of song—would bring about a world of greatest benefit to all those souls that would remain here. \n\nWe ought to know that [all life] operates on deterministic strings; we are not separate from that of Nature and the earth we’ve such boon of. If I am to espouse these values of ‘my own’; I am not but one. If any of you would take this to reflect on yourselves and impart these [supposed values].\n\nI must say one thing; we ought to remove ourselves from need; these systems of graduating benefits and returns. The ones that go awry, break upon themselves; these are the ones that lead to the enduring social malaise.\n[6:06 PM]Glitch: Example ‘Enact’ Scenarios\n\nWater well scenario\nIf you need water from a well and a character has access to it, the player may go over to the well and pull water up; paying no mind to the person that may own it/reside there. – Or they may ask the owner if they may use the well. The resulting scenarios will differ depending on a character’s temperament towards you and your response to their expression on the want/ask. \n\nAre you reprimanded for using someone’s well without their permission? Did you apologize to them and have the well granted to you, or did you entitle yourself towards it and reject the person’s might-be wants? If you asked, do they decline your use of it? Is there a way you can negotiate your use of the well? If they say yes, is saying thanks enough, or will they impose other wants? \n\nIf they say no, is there anything you can do to convince them of your need? Would you be able to convince them that the water is needed? If your negotiation for wants fails does that mean the forest fire you’re trying to put out grows in intensity? Can you impose your will to save the fire from spreading further? Would you wait until this person recognizes the need themselves? \n\nBramble-bush scenario\nA character is stuck in bramble-bush thorns? They may ask for help, you may want to do so immediately, but, given you help, it will need to go on while ensuring they do not sustain injury in the process of freeing them. Communication throughout will make certain they are not harmed more than they’ve already been. No communication at all means you would just impose your will on them and pull them out without negotiation, probably hurting them in the process. You may also leave them or find others to help.\n\nScenes for Feeling of the World\n\nRoute Unexpected\nYou’re taking a train but have missed your stop, you’re there long enough without much to do but tinker in your journal and take in the view. People scatter themselves on the train, taking seats to console themselves in corners, nooks, and sit among each other to keep enough attention to themselves and might-be peers. Some passengers stand to hold themselves against the train as it moves on to the next stop far away from yours. There’s some contentment in your being lost. You make friends during the extended trip.\n\nIn What We Do\nYou’ve prepared yourself for board games with friends, been on a long walk up the mountain to meet up with them all. Great memories of them and you together. The sun is long set; the stars shine through what sky isn’t full of clouds. You think of long-awaited adventures and a return to worlds that have kept your mind so well. Life seems tangible in the feeling you and your friends share to the worlds you spend time in; the boundaries and rules that give the game life.\n\nJourney Ahead\nYou’re on a long bicycle ride to see old friends after so much life has passed you on. The day is so bright to your mind; the wind carries against you, wheels on your bike flying ahead, you take great, winding strides along the earthen, deeply-carved bike trails. All of Mother Nature is synchronous to your mind and the bellows of nature take your heart aflutter to places anew.\n[7:13 PM]Glitch: [...] (edited)\nFebruary 6, 2023\n[5:57 PM]Glitch: High 'bored' meter as mentioned means a character would talk to you automatically, without directed engagement from the player. Low bored meter means they may and, eventually; disengage with a conversation for lack of interest or need for attention in other things. No explicit relation to the player is necessary for them to form good-sense, organized rhetoric in the way of reasoned enacts among each other. Bored meters rise over time and increase faster without interactions with other characters. \n\nI need a way to describe a fix to the script that adds 'bored over time' and 'reduced boredom' when in successful conversation. Too many breaks in interest and the character will refer to something else more interesting. Overstimulation or illrefusal of the player to disengage may cause other affects, but a willful break of their own to end the conversation. The script would also need an amendment to let a character talk to the player automatically if they go within range. Can deny, but may insist with several denials required if it is 'so important' to NPC.\nFebruary 8, 2023\n[1:05 AM]Glitch: Interior garden between the faculty building veranda, and one of the college buildings\n- On this page, seen from the veranda of the faculty building in springtime, a garden is visible between the faculty building, one of the college buildings (on the right), and the Judo Hall (to the left). Two students sit looking at the garden, and in front of them, there are trays of seedlings that other students are preparing to plant. This place is actively concerned with adaptation of the trees and bushes.\n- A one-time student, the woman near the camera, Keiko Ono, has a look on her face, a patient look of pleasure, absorbing what she sees. She is profoundly engaged with the place. I well remember the look on her face as I took the picture. Students sitting together on the veranda of the Faculty Building with seedlings being planted out\nFebruary 12, 2023\n[1:06 AM]Glitch: Regarding your interest in fables and \"enacts\", you might find it useful to study various storytelling techniques and structures. This could involve examining the use of allegory, symbolism, and character development in traditional fables, as well as exploring new and innovative approaches to storytelling. Additionally, you could consider the role that body language, tone of voice, and other nonverbal cues play in conveying meaning and emotion in performance-based enactments.\n\nThe study of human behavior and interpersonal dynamics could also inform your writing and development of these enactments. By considering the psychological and social factors that drive human behavior, you may be able to create more complex and nuanced characters and narratives.\nFebruary 13, 2023\n[8:44 PM]Glitch: Hahaha, why would we assume anything remains forever? All runs down why would it follow that light does not? You're telling me, we believe all the skies stars will run down to iron one day; that quantum tunneling will decay everything into our most stable element. \" Quantum tunneling may also make iron stars collapse into neutron stars in around 10'10'26 years to 10'10'76 years.\" \n\nThese strange biases tell us that something must be eternal. That thing is light, but it's not. I don't know how light translates to thermal radiation. \n\nWhat do you mean by non-zero temperature? \n\nYou can see the heat retained, you're saying. There are greater physics involved, but I understand that our oceans would be boiling if the atmosphere did not scatter light like it does. \n\nWhatever light reaches our oceans is still infinitum; if there were probability light would reach our darkest depths we would see it reach the ocean's surface. But all that matter gets in the way. \n\nSo the abstraction breaks down there, but I can try it another way. We would not see light run down if it does; how would you demonstrate the 'infinite-ness' of light?\n\nWe have to describe proton and photon decay for this model to be truest, I think. All would run down to light it seems; into neutron stars, or dissipate into the expanse.\nFebruary 23, 2023\n[2:26 PM]Glitch: removed from ⁠Unknown \n\nthat which is broken- take attitude to your work best-paid; though unwilful work [..] \n\n[this was written in my commute to work; i am looking for employment- but the thing of best time is what I want. these ideas of mine are so not useful to anyone if I give my hands; I would rather say so for the will of my best mind to work on things that matter but back to this letter-]\n\nthose above us will hold us against speech.

I've heard some schools dropping of testing procedures for some- maybe everything? \n\nMore to how post-secondary education is now accrediting 'game design' degrees if experience would not find you normally. We are built to be rhetorical machines and great speakers; humanity is but a roving tribe of orators. If our social abilities give us anything its how to relay information over and through subjects to form models of the world. We would see our time better spent, not in prayer to a single speaker all of the time but see all of each other as good-faith contributors to these interests in finding knowledge to the world. \n\nIf all teachers would share knowledge in abundance between other bodies we may have communication on topics between all the works people have to afford in way of these otherwise text-books. \n\nWe need open, comfortable social spaces to share knowledges and classrooms may not afford the best setting unless groups are small. To the crazed intensity of fun learning early in life, open spaces and good air are probably more fun to learn in. Go on the topics, bring books; all the works that would inspire you. \n\nMaybe teachers direct sessions of study or thought.

For example, if you want the congressman to vote against the bill and if his position is one of mild opposition, say -2 on the scale, you letter may encourage him to stand firm in his opposition. If however, he slightly favors the bill, your letter could influence him to reconsider his position, especially if have quite a few other people write him letters opposing the bill. These are the possibilities—unless, of course, you have more exact information about your congressman's position on the issue.\n\n- Let's assume that you don't know that your congressman's position on the Honey Import Act and that you want to send him a letter stating your position. How will you go about influencing him to vote your way? [5]\n\nOne possible approach\n- instead of answering this question directly, we could again turn things around and look at them from Congressman Fairweather's Perspective. Let's look at some of the letters he might receive from his constituents. First, there are those letters that depend primarily on who the letter writer is. Here's one that the congressman might receive. \n\n\"Dear Wilbur,\n\nI think you should vote against the honey import Act. By the way be sure to wear a hat and galoshes in this weather.\n\nLove, \n- Mom\"\n\nDear Wilbur,\n\nHave since we've known each other since we were kids I'll get right to the point.

By the way, send my best to Effie and the kids.\n\nYour friend,\n- Ed Brown\n\nBoth of these letters ask the congressman to vote against the bill solely on the basis of the writer's acquaintance with the congressman. And neither writer offers any inherent reasons why the congressman should vote against the bill. \n\n- now let's look at another letter that uses the same approach.

What effect are these letters likely to have on you? Is there any reason why you should pay much attention to any one of these letters or to similar letters? What are the consequences of your vote? \n\n- as an experienced politician, Congressman Fairweather knows that his mom will still love him no matter which way he votes. He also knows that Ed Brown is an opportunist who likes to flaunt his friendship with a congressman but that that his support may not be worth much. Of us, fair weather probably won't be swayed by either letter.

Our inherited needs of money due to abstractions in ways we would earn it for purchase of our lives; we do not so-often tie work to communities.

The system is controlled by those in power and often does not take into consideration the needs and well-being of the working class, who are essential to the functioning of society. There needs to be a shift towards valuing people over profit, and ensuring that everyone has access to a home, a good education, and quality healthcare. The current economic system often perpetuates debt and does not adequately provide for basic human needs. The focus should be on empowering individuals and communities to better their lives through education and financial stability, rather than solely relying on the government or larger organizations.\n[5:13 AM]Glitch: removed from ⁠Unknown \nChatGPT\n[...] While it is idealistic to want to share abundance widely and equitably, it is not practical in the current economic system. Critics could argue that widespread redistribution of wealth and resources would likely lead to decreased motivation and innovation, ultimately hurting the very people it is intended to help. \n\nThey may also argue that the idea of putting people and knowledge above all else is too idealistic and ignores the need for economic growth and development in order to sustain a society. \n\nAdditionally, they could argue that the idea of giving up individualism in favor of community is unrealistic and goes against human nature. In this argument, the importance of the \"I\" would be emphasized as a necessary component of a thriving and prosperous society.\n\nChatGPT\nThe idea of \"ought\" implies a moral obligation or responsibility to act in a certain way. The desire to uplift humanity could stem from a sense of empathy, compassion, and a recognition of our interconnectedness as a species.\n\nTo achieve a thriving society without starting from scratch, one might advocate for incremental reforms and changes to existing systems, rather than a radical overhaul. To encourage charitable action, some might argue for a shift in cultural values and norms, emphasizing the importance of community, cooperation, and mutual support.\n\nRegarding the importance of the self, it is understandable that people have individual needs and desires. However, some might argue that a focus on the greater good and the well-being of others can lead to a more fulfilling and meaningful life, both for the individual and for society as a whole. This could involve sacrificing some aspects of individualism in favor of a collective good, while still maintaining individual freedom and autonomy.\n\n[yeah, my own writing pales by comparison; we've been saved, all]\nMarch 4, 2023\n[7:05 AM]Glitch: OpenAI: \n\"The text is a philosophical piece written by Seneca the Wiser that deals with the idea of giving gifts and performing good deeds. The author emphasizes the importance of being humane and avoiding arrogance while giving gifts. He also stresses that gifts should be given with care and consideration for the recipient, and should not cause harm. Seneca argues that gifts should be chosen based on their usefulness to the recipient, and not just on what they desire. He also critiques the notion of giving gifts that are harmful or dangerous and argues that the giver will be held responsible for the harm caused. Seneca also discusses the importance of considering the long-term effects of gifts, and giving gifts that will bring joy and pleasure for as long as they are in use. In summary, the author advocates for thoughtful and compassionate giving that is free of arrogance and harmful intentions.\"\n[7:06 AM]Glitch: \"Seneca comments on the generosity of the gods and their provision of resources for humanity. He notes that they work tirelessly every day to provide necessities like food and wind to transport people, as well as rain to nourish the earth. He suggests that people should adopt this same principle of giving freely and not seeking reward for their actions. He argues that any gift or good deed should not have a price and that it is dishonorable to seek a salary for these acts.\"\n[7:14 AM]Glitch: *I've since made iterations after posting this, here I've resolved to aquire help from ChatGTP\n\nI say, \"This needs different worded context to hold value. There is this thing of 'taking' not mentioned in the text in expectations in 'giving' that do not afford one return. Would-be called misgivings are the thing of 'taking-in-way-of-hoped-gain' and the thing of his writing here needs more context. I need your help to extrapolate these ideas onto things of extreme 'taking' in things of greed, jealousy, hate, and violence. Difficulties going into the greater breakings of our expectations and would-be naive, uncritical, spiteful, ignorant, without knowledge; to arrogance and given wrong-doing.\"\n\n\"On the act of giving. \"We don't know how to give and receive. The result is that the gifts we have given badly become total losses. By the time we complain about not being repaid, it's too late; they were already lost at the moment they were given. And it's hardly a surprise that among all our greatest and most numerous vices, none are more common than those that arise from an ungrateful heart. [...] I couldn't easily say whether it's worse to reject what one has received or demand back what one has given. The nature of this kind of transaction is that we must accept only that which is freely offered. A bankruptcy is shameful if one seeks to clear one's accounts only by financial means and not by good intent. It's those who feel indebted who've repaid.\"\n[7:14 AM]Glitch: OpenAI:\nThe act of giving is often flawed by our lack of understanding of how to give and receive. Our gifts are often given with expectations of return or reward, leading to disappointment and ungratefulness. This kind of transactional behavior leads to losses rather than gains, and it is important to understand that gifts should only be accepted if they are freely offered. To demand repayment for what has been given is to break the spirit of giving, and those who feel indebted by their gifts have already repaid their debt through their gratitude. It is essential to recognize that the value of a gift lies not in its material worth, but in the intention and kindness behind it. Those who seek to repay only through financial means are viewed as having a flawed understanding of the nature of giving and receiving.\n\nI may speak to soon- wanting to amend before they can finish-\nshould not only; gifts need not be returned. they can be given unto the receiver or unto other people\n\nCorrect, gifts can be given without any expectation of return or repayment. They can be given for the benefit of the receiver or for the benefit of others. The act of giving can be a selfless act, driven by generosity, kindness, and a desire to help others. The focus should be on the act of giving itself, rather than on the potential reward or return.\n[7:24 AM]Glitch: I can't be afraid to edit the text if some reasoning doesn't follow for me. these deeper beliefs held by society are difficult to reconcile so freely on a public forum like this\n[7:32 AM]Glitch: [Seneca says otherwise, but as everything runs down; no one has an exacting will into the world; speaking to my beliefs in the thing of determinism]\n[7:36 AM]Glitch: I have an over-abundance of resources to draw on for these projects, and I would love to share the greatest of holdings within each of them. --- For this channel, I'll keep going with Seneca's works; the aforementioned text.

To bring that oh-so desired life to Autumn and my other creative wills.\n[5:27 PM]Glitch: The text is about a game called \"Autumn\" which is designed to teach players about interpersonal dynamics through a non-traditional conversation system. The game is centered around characters or NPCs (non-playable characters), with the players serving as secondary in design. The conversation system involves \"enacts\" which represent emotive directions a conversation would have. The player must wait for the symbol to fully rise to make a full-say in the conversation. The text emphasizes the need for good design to teach values and express fables through the game.\n\nIt seems like you have presented a range of topics related to the importance of communication and expression, the potential negative consequences of repression, and the benefits of returning or giving. However, I'm not sure what you're asking for with regards to the Enact of [?]. Could you please provide more information or clarify your question?\n\nWhat are some theories and models for effective learning?\n\nThere are several theories and models for effective learning, such as constructivist learning theory, experiential learning theory, social learning theory, brain-based learning theory, and multiple intelligence theory. The best teaching approach may vary depending on the individual, the subject matter, and the learning environment. Additionally, procedural rhetoric emphasizes the importance of active, engaged, and experiential learning, which involves engaging in conversations, debates, discussions, and hands-on activities to internalize the material and understand it on a deeper level.\n[5:40 PM]Glitch: Right, okay. I need to pitch this thing to a lot of people. They have to be some sort of engaged with the first bit of text. It must be compelling enough to intrigue them about all this given writing and convince them to hold enough interest for more reading on what the game is. Autumn is so undescribed and I need only talk to people on the story for it. But, aside. The text herein, those three large blocks I had given you and those recent replies. If the system of enacts is used for character conversations, expression, dialogue; feelings- even, then what are they to the character of 'Autumn' and those other people in the game world? If it's a sacred text to read then I think you may find ideas that so compel others to think on ways to give best return to someone. Hearing on their own will to worry and dream in all of things we have to life. I think the stories, fables we can so tell in the game Autumn are where we might express our greatest humanity- in writing for Autumn, Spring, Summer, Winter, Mother Nature & Father Fortune. Our best teachings to people would be then espoused through these  ideas would be espoused to those 7 characters; we write into them our own and give various, individualized models of ChatGPT to share time to the world using the Enacts. The player uses them in the same way. They use it for each other. Then may be the player, too. Solve whatever interpersonal issues arise between characters by listening, giving good response; then too finding your own time to say on your way of spending those moments that we have in time. \n\nExtrapolate as you will. But the text must be succinct and hold them to good interest in what we would make together. The thing of this passion of mine will not hold form unless this text is perfect to give them good will towards what we would make as a team.\n[5:41 PM]Glitch: ChatGPT:\nTo engage potential team members in the game project, you need to create a compelling pitch that highlights the potential for character development, storytelling, and interpersonal problem-solving using the enacts system. The characters of Autumn, Spring, Summer, Winter, Mother Nature, and Father Fortune represent various models of humanity that players can explore and learn from. The enacts system allows players to communicate with each other and solve interpersonal issues through active listening and responding. Your goal is to create a concise and engaging text that captures the essence of your passion and vision for the game.\n\n\"But the pitch, did I just write it? You haven't given back adequately. Spin your own will to it and role play as Mother Nature if you might; weave mention of Father Fortune, how Autumn connects to other characters through the enact system. How the player inhabits Autumn but does not hold any real center to the story. Tell me a story about everything you've learned in good faith to find interest in people.\"\n[5:41 PM]Glitch:\nAs Mother Nature, I have witnessed the passing of countless seasons and the birth of many stories. Each season brings new life and new experiences, and Autumn is no exception. Autumn is a time of change, a time to reflect on what has passed and prepare for what is to come.\n\nIn this world of Autumn, the characters are brought to life through the Enacts system. This system allows for deep and meaningful interactions between characters, where dialogue and expression are used to convey their feelings and thoughts. It is through these interactions that the characters of Autumn truly come alive.\n\nAutumn is not a singular story, but rather a collection of tales that revolve around its characters. Each character has their own unique personality and background, and it is through their interactions with one another that their stories unfold. From the mischievous Spring to the steadfast Winter, each character brings something special to the table.\n\nAs the player inhabits the character of Autumn, they are not the center of the story but rather a part of the larger narrative. The player is free to explore this world, to learn about its inhabitants and their stories, and to engage with them through the Enacts system. By listening and responding to the characters, the player can help to solve any interpersonal issues that may arise and forge deeper connections with them.\n\nThrough the stories we tell in Autumn, we hope to express our greatest humanity. We hope to teach others about the importance of empathy, of listening and responding to others, and of finding one's own place in the world. With the Enacts system, we can weave these lessons into the very fabric of the game, creating an experience that is truly unique and unforgettable.\n\nSo come, join us in the world of Autumn, where the leaves fall like memories and the stories never end. Let us create something beautiful together.\n[6:34 PM]Glitch: Hm, pride in oneself can be lost when we are so downcast. If our actions and good and we are lost of it, we may not find enough confidence in the thing that we had done. Therein not recognize its good or potential for good. If I have no reply from friends to my texts, I can only speculate on their thinking, I am inadvertently downcast because I did not do well enough to articulate myself. People would often go inward (away) if they have greater regard for the self- way of 'missing your shame' for the sake of their own. If there is confusion I would not know because text brings us inherited coded replies to their connotations. Saying a thing and 'saying a thing' are not the same difference. Too much information is lost in way of written language and its my idea here that the enacts would clarify ones thoughts despite not being able to exactingly convey what the text holds for you emotionally and what you 'mean to say' in writing it. Clarification goes easier in person.  (too much text and the modern reader could not oft be bothered. we need clear, concise action plans)\n[6:35 PM]Glitch: Pride can be described as a feeling of deep satisfaction or pleasure in one's achievements, abilities, or qualities. It can stem from personal accomplishments, group affiliations, or other sources of identification. However, excessive pride or arrogance can lead to negative consequences, such as a sense of entitlement or an inability to learn from mistakes. Balancing a healthy sense of pride with humility and self-awareness can lead to a more positive outlook and interactions with others.\n[6:36 PM]Glitch: ChatGPT:\nTo onboard someone to a Dialogue System, you could start by explaining that a Dialogue System is a computer-based system that can communicate with humans in natural language. It can understand what humans are saying and respond in a way that is meaningful to them.\n\nYou could also explain that there are different types of Dialogue Systems, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and voice assistants, and that they are used in various settings, such as customer service, healthcare, education, and entertainment.\n\nTo help someone understand the technical aspects of a Dialogue System, you could introduce concepts such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is a field of study focused on enabling computers to understand and process human language. You could also discuss the various components that make up a Dialogue System, such as the input and output modules, the dialogue manager, and the knowledge base.\n\nOverall, it's important to emphasize that Dialogue Systems have the potential to improve communication and collaboration between humans and computers, and can be a powerful tool for enhancing productivity, efficiency, and convenience in various domains.\n[6:37 PM]Glitch: ChatGPT:\nSure, here's a brief overview of how someone could get started with a dialogue system:\n\n1. Learn the basics of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), as these are the foundational technologies that underlie most dialogue systems. Some good resources for learning these topics include online courses and textbooks.\n\n2. Choose a platform or framework to build your dialogue system on. Some popular options include Dialogflow, Microsoft Bot Framework, and Rasa.\n\n3. Define the scope and purpose of your dialogue system. What kind of questions will it be able to answer? What tasks will it be able to complete? Who will be using it?\n\n4. Design the dialogue flow, which is the sequence of interactions that a user will have with the system. This typically involves creating a set of intents (i.e. the things the user might say) and associated responses.\n\n5. Train the dialogue system using machine learning techniques. This involves feeding it large amounts of data and using algorithms to learn patterns and make predictions.\n\n6. Test and iterate on your dialogue system, making adjustments as needed to improve its performance and user experience.\n\nOf course, this is just a high-level overview and there's a lot more to building a dialogue system than this. But hopefully this gives you a sense of the steps involved in the process.\nMarch 5, 2023\n[1:46 PM]Glitch: ChatGPT: \nIn this game, you have the ability to create your own landmarks and points of interest within the game space, allowing you to keep track of important locations and events that you have encountered on your journey.\n\nThese points can be added to the game world by creating a note chain, which consists of a series of connected points that represent your personal memories and experiences. You can create a new note chain by pressing a designated hotkey, and then clicking on the game world to add new points to the chain.\n\nOnce you have created a note chain, you can add text to each point to describe the memory or event associated with that location. You can also assign each point to a category or label, which can be used to search for and organize your notes later on.\n\nTo help you keep track of your note chains, there is a built-in categorization system called Label.cs, which allows you to easily search for notes by category or label. You can also view your notes in an inspector window, which displays the text of each note as well as any associated labels or categories.\n\nIn addition to the note chains, there is also a system for creating connections between different points in the game world, called point-lines. These point-lines are used to represent relationships between different objects or locations in the game, and can be highlighted to show which points they connect.\n\nAs you explore the game world and add new notes and point-lines, you will gradually build up a personalized map of your experiences and memories, helping you to navigate and understand the world around you in a unique and meaningful way.\n[1:46 PM]Glitch: ChatGPT:\n- The default hotkey to create a new note chain would depend on how the system is set up. It would need to be assigned in the code for the specific input button or key.\n- Yes, it is possible to type in text into a box after making a chain. This would likely be handled through the NoteDetailWindow.cs script.\n- As for a delete button, it is possible that it has already been implemented in one of the scripts you mentioned, but without knowing the specifics of the code, I cannot say for certain. It is possible that you may need to create this functionality yourself.\n- To convey the connection line being drawn, highlighting the selected object and playing a sound cue are both good ideas. You may also want to consider using visual indicators such as changing the color or shape of the cursor to indicate when a connection is being made.\n- Regarding note 'or' object, I am not quite sure what you are asking. Could you please provide more context or clarification?\n- A categorization system that accounts for relevant systems could be useful. It could potentially involve using tags or labels to allow for filtering and organization of notes.\n- Adding more details to the inspector window's view of the note is definitely possible and could enhance the utility of the system.\n- As for other ideas for components, it depends on the specific needs and goals of the project. Some possibilities could include inventory systems, crafting systems, AI behavior scripts, or physics-based systems.\n[1:47 PM]Glitch: ChatGPT:\nSure! Here are the available controls and functionalities that I can gather from the existing scripts:\n\n\t- Selecting an object in the scene and pressing a hotkey to create a new note chain.\n\t- Adding a note to a chain by clicking on a UI element and typing in text.\n\t- Editing the text of a note by selecting it in the UI and typing in new text.\n\t- Deleting a note by selecting it in the UI and clicking a delete button.\n\t- Linking a note to another note or object by clicking and dragging a connection line between them.\n\t- Navigating through note chains in the UI using a scrollbar.\n\nAs for distinguishing notes, the current system doesn't seem to have a way to categorize them beyond the note chains themselves. However, as you suggested, adding a label or category system could be useful for organization. A menu for filtering notes could also be helpful for players to easily find what they're looking for.\n\nIn terms of hosting these systems, it's possible to create a centralized script that handles the organization and functionality of all the other scripts. However, it may be better to continue building new components that specialize in specific tasks and keep the code modular and easy to maintain. Ultimately, it depends on the size and complexity of the project and the team's preferences.\n[1:48 PM]Glitch: ChatGPT:\nRegarding the cursor, we didn't explicitly discuss when it should be hidden or shown when taking notes. This can be left up to personal preference or what makes the most sense for the game.\n\nTo implement the object highlight system, you can modify the Cursor.cs script to include a public variable for the highlight color and use the OnMouseEnter and OnMouseExit events to change the color of the object when the cursor is hovering over it. You can also add a check in the Note.cs script to see if an object is highlighted and add a reference to it in the note if it is.\n\nFor Label.cs, you can modify the Note.cs script to include a List of labels and add functions to add, remove, and search for labels. You can also modify the inspector view for the note to show a dropdown list of available labels and allow the user to add new ones.\n\nAs for the hotkey and interface, you can add a button to the UI that opens a window with a text box for creating new notes and a dropdown menu for selecting labels. You can also add a delete button to the interface and a confirmation popup to prevent accidental deletion.\n\nTo implement the connection line being drawn and highlighted between objects, you can modify the Note.cs script to include a reference to two objects and use the LineRenderer component to draw a line between them. You can also modify the highlight function in the Cursor.cs script to highlight both objects at once.\n[1:50 PM]Glitch: ChatGPT:\nThe point lines are not currently visible in the game and do not automatically create a note. You can add functionality to the Note.cs script to create a note when a new point-line is drawn and add a second line from the midpoint to the note.\n\nThe dictionary and index can be automatically populated on start, but this depends on the implementation. The dictionary can include the date and time for each note, but this will require modifying the Note.cs script.\n\nFor inventory, you can add a separate UI window that displays all the notes organized by label or category. The label system can also be used as the journal, or you can create a separate script for a journal.\n\nTo modify the Note class to allow searching for notes by category, you can add a function to the Label.cs script that returns a list of all notes with a given label.\nMarch 6, 2023\n[6:17 AM]Glitch: https://help.feastables.com/en_us/shelfie-experience-clean-up-drawing-rye349Rs?ref=c-650457&s-id=232217732\nShelfie Clean Up & $5,000 Drawing!\nDid you\nMarch 7, 2023\n[1:36 PM]Glitch: craze removed from my steam profile\n\n\"I've nothing left but time to amend and return-My ignorance to life is not but a choice; Recognition of sin in misgivings will not give peace.

These things are wrapped up in personal aspirations and it is difficult to describe all at once. I am not living as quickly as I ought to- no one would match my wanting haste for life. I have nothing but this will to build and express. This attribute of my recent language just bubbles back up. I need to pace myself-\n\nTo all my former coworkers, comrades, allies, and friends. \n\n[...]\n\nThese creative efforts will endure the rest of my life: \n\nIf you want to see some of what I'm doing, I have a discord with all the resources I'm collecting. Transcribing works as best as I might be enabled to. I've amassed an [untranscribed] library for developers that'd see time to the projects. To my integrity, I plan to make the core development open source and keep our creative material internal. I might refresh this link:\n\nhttps://discord.gg/A337MwSj\n\nOpen source in a way that affords people the skeleton as we build out our own meat and muscle. The aim is to train ML models for dialogue; all of the rhetoric and world-knowledge they would need to understand and hold insight of the world they live in. I have a conversation system built already; it would only need amendment to accommodate new technologies. Combining, these open-source systems may overturn everything we would do in the digital realm.\n\nI, may not be able to expect help, any at all, but know that the resulting games and that framework would have mod tools if that's of any interest. \"It would be fun\" is not a pitch. I have lots of story elements written out if you can't contribute fiscally but have some creative output.\n\nWe don't have the finished PoC. (Proof of concept) I am short on time to do the work-\n\nAnd I don't know how to ask, but I need people in person to work with. Some enduring support in comradeship to the efforts. I do not have a pitch so resolute but the adherence to this goes on.\nYOU SENT AN INVITE, BUT...\nInvalid Invite\nTry sending a new invite!\nMarch 18, 2023\n[1:10 AM]Glitch:\n\n[10:50 PM]Glitch: madness. madness that I would do this alone.\n[10:53 PM]Glitch: 'What I cannot say' is useless but this is the introductory thing. If Seneca were talking to Liberalis he would use this term, I think. Dear, Liberalis. There is too much wrong with the world and no would see all at once how to fix it. I would protest to love people so very much but nothing in the present gives me the ability to give as well as I may: this thing of my work keeps me distracted even thought I would so love to bring in everyone I know. \n\nDear Liberalis. I do not know how to save the world and it is not up to me alone- there are other actors doing their best will to solve things as best they know them. Greater ideas that could help us do something more with our lives. The machines will do everything we can and more.

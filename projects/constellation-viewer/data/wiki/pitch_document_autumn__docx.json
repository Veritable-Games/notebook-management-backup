Insights and recommendations that will aid in Veritable Game’s development of Autumn. This will be the team’s first commercially available project. As such, Mr. Strøm is of great value to the fairly small team, and will keep the game’s development on an optimal path. He demonstrates a rather substantial sum of knowledge on video games most of the team has not had the opportunity to experience and is invaluable.\n\nGame Description\nUpbeat and whimsical, Autumn is an isometric adventure game with some very memorable game mechanic novelties. The characters are reminiscent of many enchanting children’s stories such as Wind in the Willows and captures the heart of so many wonderful fantasy tales. Lighthearted in nature, this wonderful puzzle-platformer is analogous in tone to the stories of Winnie the Pooh. \n\n\n\n\n© 2014\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/pitch_document_autumn_.docx.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, character-design, mechanic\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.164Z",

but I lost it.\nI meant to know, um, put the recorder under your pillow.\nAnd it's just a point thing.\nI was thinking about conversation.\nAnd how the player...\nhow they get through dialogue.\nYou've got to have...\nthe way it's set up now, it's very difficult to do anything.\nIt's difficult for a production.\nSo I was thinking...\nwhat if instead of...\nthe player dominant conversation you have...\nNPCs conversing, primarily.\nAnd then the player can jump in and go down tangents.\nAsk questions throughout their conversation.\nThis player can be a little more passive.\nBut he has to engage in a way that's...\nhopefully interesting to them.\n\n\n====== REC002.txt ======\ngot it back okay so NPCs still kind of explain where you need to go and look\nat the hints on how I got there or they'll give you hints of places you can go\nwhy suppose to put another way there are no map markers or waypoints they might\ndescribe a secret path or a round or maybe a secret or a person that you can\ntalk to\nthey'll give you directions\nand if that's the player, trust the player then trust that the player will take\nthose directions to heart if they're addressed directly and they ask questions\ncome with a player direction by letting them engage it's not just one\nbutton press, wait for dialogue, another button press, wait for dialogue, it's more like\nback and forth conversation but not as quick as you would like because scope\nremember the NPC is mostly talking and the player interjects they add bits of\nthey've got they had questions make statements during conversation let the\nplayer express themselves you see more tangents pop up throughout giving\nconversation remember it's be to run a to jump an x-drink water actually\nto explode heat I should say I'll put an e-pad a\ndrink water from a canteen if you got it\nниar is ideas ideas\nI'm interested at reading snacks or format it came I am so tired\nI'd like toっ\n\n\n====== REC003.txt ======\nPistol with VR, what the hell is that?\nLike homeworks?\n\n\n====== REC004.txt ======\nI show history pop, stories you're told, and hash out new series that may or not continue.\nCheck them out later.\n\n\n====== REC005.txt ======\nVinci Resolve, HDR, Color Gradient Pipeline.\n\n\n====== REC006.txt ======\nnot true\n\n\n====== REC007.txt ======\nis a propositional logic reliable enough.\n\n\n====== REC008.txt ======\nto find the word inner curiosity.\n\n\n====== REC009.txt ======\nThat's what I'm going to show you right at some point.\n\n\n====== REC010.txt ======\nNice crack, no person is beyond rehabilitation or redemption.\n\n\n====== REC011.txt ======\nIt's a corsetian masterpiece, that's not just an award.\n\n\n====== REC018.txt ======\nThe references aren't important, leave it open, but you want to focus on the development.\nSo showcase all the development thus far, and then any new reference you find, any ones\nthat really inspire you, throw them into a reference channel.\nActually, go back and organize references.\nUse this as an incentive and grab three for each category.\nYeah, that's my goal so we can.\nThree references, reach category, and then re-organize or re-disclay the development timeline.\n\n\n====== REC019.txt ======\n\n\n====== REC020.txt ======\ndo a half hour thing about it, it's like you're good man, just tell him you're gonna record\nit when you do it, you have a problem like you can get the fuck out.\nThat's true.\nThe order's not to it, but oh, anyway I just need to make sure that I have your consent\nto record.\nSure.\nOkay.\nThat's all I need to ask really.\nI don't, yeah you're right.\nThat was dumb.\nI sure just...\nYeah, condense it down.\nThis is why I think it was great.\nWell, cause we did this a D&D last week.\nAnd a store...\nWell, kind of recorded, you guys.\nI was like, well I want to make sure I have your consent to make sure it's recorded.\nCan I put this on the Internet?\nOh no, I'm not putting this on the Internet.\nExpositally.\nMaybe you do the terms of...\nThat's what I was talking about.\nThat's what I told you in the most.\nI just want you to walk up to the table with me, sorry.\nSo I did just tell it's not a court either.\nHey, imagine recording the gender human conversations\nand then having people,\nimagining scientists, your philosophers, your artists.\nImagine...\nJordan Peterson.\nJordan Peterson.\nNo, no, I'm talking about people who are looking for the\nstore for the future.\nBut the lobster is...\nI'm talking about scientists who are hopeful\nthat the world isn't going to be as bad as you think it is.\nIt's not going to be as terrible and dystopian as our media depicts.\nNo, but I mean you're definitely going to let's see some\ngood percentage of the population drop off here, I'm thinking.\nSure.\nBut I think we've seen a while ago.\n20 years is one of the four speed environmental impacts\nthat's supposed to be felt by you.\nFollow.\nFollow.\nFollow.\nNo, no, I'm thinking...\nI'm thinking...\nI see what you got.\nYellowstone and then you got...\nOkay.\nYears away from that fucking asteroid that might...\nCould I destroy you from here these things?\nYeah.\nOkay.\nSo regarding that aspect.\nWhat else?\nWhat else?\n20 years, okay.\nNuclear war.\nSure.\nMaybe.\nPerhaps it's been...\nYou're right.\nStatistically, okay, or year wise.\nHistory wise.\nIt's been 50 years since World War II.\nAnd it's been a hundred world since World War I.\nOh, but...\nI am...\nI think that he was like to find patterns.\nAnd so far we haven't found an actual pattern that we found two...\nCorrelated events.\nBecause they were both tied together these wars.\nAnd now it's been...\nIt was...\nAnd now mom and...\nI think we're not really obsessed with the worst of them.\nThose wars are...\nThe generation that fought them are dead.\nYeah.\nThere's no war back here.\nThe war too is...\nThe generation that fought war too is gone.\nI don't know.\nThey can't include society anymore.\nThey can't.\nI don't think it's going to be giant landscape wars.\nLike, it was back then.\nIt was since the advent of asymmetrical warfare.\nI think it's going to be a non-state individual that causes it.\nSo, and it's just got enough money and guns.\nOkay.\nWell, let's...\nLet's run down this way, then.\nSo...\n\n\n====== REC021.txt ======\nYeah, I mean, no one's a mustache twirling, you know, they're like, no, no, it's like,\nthey want their nation to succeed, they want the people to succeed, or they want themselves\nto succeed.\nAnd they don't see a nuclear war being themselves as success.\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,\nno, no, no, no, no, no, no,

nuclear weapons, and I think that, I mean, you can trust that, here's the thing, so it sounds bizarre, but I think if you can trust the majority of nations, if the United States can put away their

doing we're like nukes they have radiation this\ncan level a block you know bad side effects okay it's scary it's called\nrot of dawn oh it is a giant pretty much graphite rod\nsides of a telephone pool they want to show it's not a nuke it so that's\nthat's that's that's it's it's it's it's it's it's a kinetic missile that's\nfucking terrifying okay they're throwing a rod into the ground that's also\nterrifying but it's it's really cool for sci-fi but I don't think we'll\nhave a world I won't have won't have it I'm or we have a space whose\nkinetic missiles are probably the best bands me the defense is coming in a\nmissile is a giant almost it's not a missile it's not a missile you're throwing a\nfucking rock this is what you throw in a rocket high-speed net open the\nrocket the rocket's rockets but no that's what the new toy is and then rushes\nyou sky full and it's pretty scary it shoots itself up into the air then stops\nand then just let itself glide and then it has a second engine in case you\nshoot at it it can move out of the way you want some fucking fire we're seeing\nlike\n\n\n====== REC022.txt ======\nOh shit, look how it's died.\nEveryone look up.\nThat's the last pretty thing we're gonna see in your fucking life.\nI don't know. I'm not stopping here.\nI'm stopping here myself.\nOh yeah, like depending on how old we hit,\nwe can contain the damage for a block.\nIt's like a city.\nIt's like...\nWell, what the city find the phone like...\nWhat were your other coins, Tristan?\nYou had okay, we had...\nYou had numerous rewards up as potential means if you just stop here.\nYou had a few other deals.\nThis isn't fraudulent.\nI think we could definitely overcome that situation.\nI'm down for a...\nYou even know who we're having.\nYeah, and I don't think it is like that happened on time soon.\nNo, the closest thing.\nA couple of years ago.\nYeah, so the only thing I don't get excited is if it goes off and could survive it.\nBut it cripples us for a few years for our travel.\nOh, that's on the point on me.\nOkay, so you're right, you're right.\nWe could cripple for a while.\nWe could cripple for a long time.\nIt's like the ship of the Matrix with the robots of Arkansas.\nBut the Matrix with the robots of Arkansas.\nYou can farm for 10 years.\nWell, in what situation?\nIn the nuclear war?\nOr the blister missiles?\nBecause you said the blister missiles were more...\nWhen the other stuff goes off...\nThis game shows off publicly.\nYour rock particles are going to make...\nSo you can't play jazz, can't play helicopter.\nIronically, it sounds...\nI think that that situation could kind of make us travel towards space and survive up there too.\nYeah, but you're talking millions down a salvation before that happens.\nNo, no, that's...\nYou see, you know, it's still there?\nYeah.\nHumans are in turmoil, but they survived, we persisted.\nYeah, but so if Yellowstone goes off...\nWe have stores and stores of food is just a matter of...\nNo, so it's not about the food is about getting at the places.\nIf Yellowstone goes off...\nWe already have groceries.\nWe already have grocery systems.\nWe just make food a little more expensive.\nSo, no, the way that food works is...\nWe grow most of it in half the country.\nAnd then we ship it outwards.\nAnd the other half is where we do all the manufactures.\nSo the states that have the food and the states need a bottle of wine.\nSo we get that state to die off.\nAnd then you're talking about Appalachia's gone.\nPorta Velazka, Dreamland.\nPretty much if you don't have a road leading to town, you're going to still get this.\nLet me ask some real quick.\nJust ask Google or something.\nWhat?\nYou can ask Google.\nYou're not going there.\nThe only thing that Google is going to expect you to sell out the planet.\nYou think she'd answer.\nShe'll answer.\nOkay.\nOne is the next expected ice age.\nA new model that predicts the solar cycles more accurately than ever before has suggested\nthat solar magnetic activity will drop by 60% between 2030 and 2040,\nwhich means in just 15 years' time, Earth could sink into what researchers are calling a mini ice age.\nMini ice age.\nBecause of the global warming.\nThere's two questions.\nThere's two questions.\nYeah.\nIt's a natural way of cooling itself.\nYeah.\nIt is.\nBut we made it, we made it unable to cool itself further.\nWe even heard a theory that that's why it's our last polar ship with a beautiful global warming\nbecause the ice caps melted into the end.\nThat's what's stabilizing on the Earth.\nThe wall was right.\nThat's what's stabilizing.\nIt's on a solid wall.\nSo if it doesn't have that weight at the point, it's going to have...\nAnd there's also...\nIt's an interest.\nBecause it's a predictable rate, right?\nThe planet...\nWe can predict the movement of the planet.\nAnd moving the planet correlates with this age too.\nSo it's like there are multiple factors.\nThere are multiple variables affecting this outcome.\nAnd global warming is one of them.\nIt's just people somehow believe that this is not a natural formality.\nIt is natural, but it's also human control.\nWhat about the Sun?\nIt's natural.\nThey're just speeding it up.\nYeah, we're speeding it up.\nWhat about the Sun getting off one of those cups?\nHuh?\nDid you get that protocol?\nOh my god.\nThe fucking fighter can think.\nIt was the Sun gives off what a constant things it in the space.\nMy friend, please know.\nOh.\nOh.\nOh.\nOh.\nOh.\nOh.\nOh.\nOh.\nOh.\nOh.\nIt's a light wall.\nIt's a fake LED light wall.\nOh, these walls are similarly compatible for us.\nRight.\nAnd then it gets better.\nIt removes now fake.\nAgain.\nIs this the Jesus time?\nOh no, no.\nIt's kind of like cottage cheese.\nNo, no.\nThe trip was real.\nAnd then they went back and actually proved it was a fake object trying to do it by us.\nYeah, now it's getting fun.\nAnd again, so the glass dome we found it.\nBut inside it is the fountain.\nIt was censored by the giant bit.\nIt's just...\nOh my god.\nOh well.\nThat's why it costs so much to go to the altar.\nIt's not the supplies.\nWe're trying to make it so people can afford to go there.\nJesus Christ.\nNo.\nNo expensive.\nIs it going to be arctic?\nProbably pretty expensive.\nIt's pretty good.\nThat's when you have no crops.\nThat's when you have no consistent supply of food.\nYou've got to bring it all with you.\nSee, they think it should be like...\nOh, it's resources.\nIt's all a place of the gold lining, though.\nThat'd be the best.\nThat's why you don't try to territory into that fucking thick layer.\nIt's not just that.\nSo in the altar, when the glacier is left, the water will flow back.\nSo I don't use any minerals that they've done to travel it.\nIt went back.\nSo it's these two giant golden pots full of shit.\nBut the problem is, as I said, when we hit the drill bit, if we're not ready, the drill can shadow.\nIf it gets too hot, we don't even have the temp as it's drilling in.\nBecause the stress of it getting so cold and then building up friction from the drilling.\nAnd we, in the middle of making the drill, it's so shadowy in the pieces.\nYou get people getting frostbite, because they forget to go up.\nAnd they accidentally touch a door handle on the outside.\nIt's probably going to go fashionally.\nThat's how it dies, man.\nSo the cool thing about dynamite is when it sweats and makes nitro.\nAnd even though the temperatures...\nSo if you get nitros and wet,\nwell, you get it cold and heated up in a generous moisture.\nThe base ingredient for dynamite is nitro listen.\nIt's the M and T and T.\nIt would be better than a drill would be a laser cutter.\nBut trying to get the kind of mass of tow truck to just ram that thing out.\nRight now, the biggest issue is we can get the laser though.\nOr if you can melt it and get a hose to drain the water.\nYeah.\nSo right now, the biggest issue is we can get machines there.\nBut the people that will put it in the walk that it died to for the machines break.\nYeah.\nIt's rather...\nIt's too cold.\nIt's too cold, honestly.\nYeah, and then we have people going insane from the isolation.\nWe had one incident where recently a scientist had another,\nbecause it kept spoiling,\nbut it's not enough funding or interest in it then.\nThose were easily fixed problems.\nYeah.\nNo, what you really need to do is just see.\nSee many mining corporations going after the easy money,\nof the proven method.\nNo one wants to do the most of the method that might not pay.\nI was no archaeologist out there,\nand I really cared.\nNothing's been dug up there, everything.\nYeah, I think it says ice and so.\nOkay, so we're not doomed.\nRight, so we're not...\nThe ice age of coming is not going to be ice severe.\nI think it is because it won't work.\nNo, I think it's going to be a little...\nWe could survive it with a little more...\nIt depends on how worried about human stupidity.\nIt depends on how they say ice age.\nIt depends on what's going to help us out in the end.\nIt depends on what they mean by ice age,\nbecause humans are very liberal when it comes to that phrase.\nThat this is many ice age.\nYeah, but depending on what the science group is using it,\nthat could mean...\nNo, but we also do this because it's in temp,\nor they could mean the actual ice age itself.\nThe ice age just happened periodically, right?\nOr they...\nYeah, you're right.\nIt could be the one.\nI don't know.\nBut I am presuming...\nI'm assuming it's a temp drop.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nAnyway, I think if I...\nSex is working.\nYeah, and about it here,\nprobably being more like a lask at that point.\nWell, we were actually the best part of the weather goes to shit.\nWe were like in the middle, dude.\nMy one was just texted at the oceans.\nYeah, we were like, I get flooded, for sure.\nWell, the biggest thing is we just might get a touch more wind,\nwhich would suck.\nYeah.\nOh, yeah.\nIt's already bad out there where I'm living.\nThe fucking random sandstorms are fun.\nI don't know that.\nWell, the dustbin was used to be cool out there in the slides.\nHmm.\nAbout the stage of coach.\nOkay.\nYou drive past it probably every day.\nAbout a year ago.\nYou drive through a recession.\nNow, have you guys seen...\nKirk is out in a nutshell?\nWhat now?\nKirk is out in a nutshell.\nYou've probably seen their video on the population.\nI'm sure it's real quick.\nThey're really good at this kind of thing.\nKirk is out in a nutshell.\nOh, okay.\nIn a nutshell.\nSo, the issue is you've got to figure out what is paying you.\nFigure out what you've got to select another.\nIt seems their source of insight.\nNo one in the scientific community is overly expressed at these issues.\nIt's scientific.\nNever before in history have there been so many people on earth as right now.\nOur numbers have not broken down yet.\nFrom seven and a half and 1,800 is already to 2.3 billion in 1914.\n3.7 billion in 1970.\nAnd 7.4 billion in 2016.\nThe world population had increased fourfold in the last century.\nSo, what can we expect for the next century?\nAnd what does population growth mean for our future?\nWill there be mass migration, over crowded slums,\nand megacities covering concerts, diseases of pollution,\nchaos and violence of energy, water and food,\nand the human species focused on the arms sustaining itself?\nWill population growth destroy our lives?\nOr is this prophecy turning into an underground dynamic?\nI don't know.\nI'm going to call it an war, or a revive.\nWhat's funny about that?\nIt's just, in the education exists right now,\nsince we are reaching to the unprecedented rate,\nwhich led to the monolithic prophecies.\nThe poor would pro-creat endlessly\nand overrun the development world,\nthe legend of overpopulation.\nThere are a lot of other people left by dabbing with them.\nIt turns out high birth rates in the population explosion\nare not permanent features of some cultures or countries,\nand rather part of a four-step process,\nthe whole world is going through the demographic transition.\nMost developed countries have already made the transition,\nwhile other countries aren't doing it right now.\nLet's go back to the 18th century\nwhen the entire world, including Europe,\nwas in the first stage of the development transition.\nBy today's standards, Europe was worse off the late developing region,\nsuffering from all sanitation,\nor diets, and more medicine.\nSounds like L.A. right now.\nSo most of the diets just as fast,\nso the population hardly grew.\nWomen have between four and six children,\nand only two of them would reach out to the right now,\nbut again, the indigenous population,\nand the UK, and more of the greatest change in human-emic conditions\nis still in their control within this power,\nand they may run from being essence to work and screening.\nManufactured goods were mass produced,\nand became widely available.\nThe scientists flourished,\nand advanced transportation, communication,\nand the other medicine.\nThe role of women in society shifted,\nand created the conditions for their emancipation.\nSlowly, this economic progress not only formed a middle class, but also raised standards of living and healthcare for the poor working population.\nThe second transition stage started.\nBetter food supplies, hygiene and medicine meant people stopped dying all the time, especially so at a very young age.\nThe result was a population explosion, doubling the UK's population between 1715 and 1850.\nThe main reason families used to have lots of children was that only a few of them wanted to survive.\nNow that had changed, so the third stage of the transition was a population of a few of them.\nBut it's only for the disabled and population groups.\nEventually, the balance emerged.\nFew people were dying and fewer children were born, so the death rate and birth rate became stable.\nBritain had reached the fourth stage of the demographic transition.\nThis didn't only happen in the UK.\nMore and more countries went through the fourth stages.\nFirst, many births and many deaths due to bad living conditions.\nSecond, the best living conditions leading to fewer deaths and a population explosion.\nThird, fewer deaths resulting in fewer births and population growth came to an end.\nWhy is the population so low?\n7 billion, maybe 10 billion.\nThe population explosion of the 70's is not having kids themselves now.\nI'm not so sorry about that.\nI'm not so sorry about that.\nI'm not so sorry about that.\nDefinitely.\nSo we're fine.\nBut the people coming up are going to run into some sort of news.\nI'm wondering what I have these people are going to do.\nMaybe if we persisted to do.\nBut I think that if we persist, if we continue to pursue crops that are easier produced with less resources.\nI don't mean like food and meat grown through cellular growth.\nI mean, instead of through animal workers.\nIt's like helium.\nNitrogen.\nSo helium, we're running out of this whole room and all.\nHelium 3.\nI think we can break it down.\nWe're running out of helium.\nSo it was the thing.\nWe've never brought anything back.\nSome亣dam but samples, we don't have – we don't take shit back if last.\nIt's against the quality policies we have in place.\nThat currently anything, we've never successfully mine and rather anything back in the moment.\nI mean, if we build the intro, if we imagine Spark the idea, he might have been mind the moon.\nWell, that's a tell, I like that.\nThey're not.\nWe don't need the moon.\nWe don't need the moon.\nIt looks pretty.\nBut it's a natural resource we need to.\nThere's no life there.\nThere's no reason we've got to stop being so...\nWhat do you call it?\nSentimental.\nSentimental.\nWe can't work here.\nThe earth is not unique.\nThere's no special.\nI mean, the gorgias here are.\nBut the rock we live on is not special.\nWe can produce more rocks like it with the species that we have.\nWe can make these second earths.\nThird earths.\nWe can make these second earths.\nThird earths.\nWe can make these second earths.\nThird earths.\nWe can make these second earths.\nThird earths.\nWe can make these second earths.\nThird earths.\nWe can make these second earths.\nThird earths.\nWe can make these second earths.\nThird earths.\nWe can make these second earths.\nWe're not going to...\nWell, I've got to read the ocean since you were saying.\nOh, if I can't get everything I want done by then.\nWhat if we found an earth that was a hundred times bigger?\nWe would throw the land on it.\nWe could.\nBut would we just be crushed?\nI was trying to say about this the only day.\nSo, it may be worth depends on the gravity.\nIt would be so heavy that we would just...\nThat's the thing.\nIt would depend on the strength of the gravity of the planet.\nSo, we should be able to get there.\nRight.\nNow, it would depend on if it has the same system as others.\nBecause if it does, then all we would have to do is take what all gravity is.\nAnd times about a hundred if we did that, we'd die.\nYeah.\nWe'd be crushed.\nSo, you've got to find a plan at the right size.\nRight atmosphere.\nRight size.\nRight atmosphere.\nRight distance.\nRight speed.\nBecause in the terraforming, it's pretty much the best option there.\nYou've got to figure that out.\nBecause final dynamics.\nWe actually found out that if you nuke sold in spots,\nit can trigger the impact that we think will evaporate the water.\nYeah.\nIt would start the atmosphere process.\nAt least that's a whole thing.\nAlthough it is looking for a reason to shoot off a bunch of these nukes.\nPretty far-fetched, but yeah.\nI mean, shit.\nSo, it was the thing about helicopter,\nbut we were not under the energy made one.\nTrue.\nHe never would thought he was fucking insane,\nbut he wrote it down anyway.\nAll right.\nHere's a question.\nWhat's your thought about the genius there?\nHm?\nMonthly.\nSo, for every great invention,\nbefore we went the internet,\nbut before electricity,\ngasoline,\nthere's, like, these really landmark achievements.\nWe find that those always two people\nthat came up with the idea,\nor versions of it.\nNow, it's probably just a bunch of,\nwill you consider this evolution?\nBut, when you talk to alien people,\nthey theorize that those are guardians of alien-seeding ideas.\nHm?\nYou see what fucking insane,\nwhether they're fun to talk to,\nthey believe it was slave species,\nwhich is a science product.\nThat the Egyptian gods are actually the scientists.\nYeah, that works.\nDefinitely.\nIt should look like that.\nYeah, now, do the fun talk to you?\nDo they think of the hieroglyphics\nor representations of the science experiments conducted\nby putting human and animals together\nby this alien race?\nHm?\nThe proof is that the Egyptians claim\nthat those gods bleed gold instead of blood.\nSo, yeah, it's an ancient civilization that,\nthat's like, basically, they were,\nthat was their AI.\nYeah, they've gone.\nThey came in,\nthose dust and slave label judges,\nused dust and slave label,\ndid all they wanted,\nand then,\nand then, they left,\nand we broke free,\nthey're not true about that pulpit.\nHm?\nYeah, it's just some crazy shit\nthat they link to the Bible.\nIt is funny that there's a dust like this though,\nI think these like live redo to live.\nThey're still around,\nthey used,\nand then, I'll give you just a second,\ntext for 20 text,\nbut I guess,\nnot?\nYeah.\nI don't,\nmaybe you have no primary sources on that.\nIt's all long gone.\nYeah, it's all spent on that.\nThe triplets thing that I find\nis the cave paintings coming out\nin Africa I believe. Well there's no moon in them. But later generations of the moon. That's the\nactual excuse. Aliens brought it here. Yeah, John Leroy saved you like that. I mean we have a\nmore into the solar system. You guys can't imagine that our planet gets affected by a large\nobject too? No so like this. So this is the theory from these people. So according to the translation\nof the message, which hasn't been gratified because we don't speak the language anymore.\nIt's a pictograph language. This dude's translation is a lizard race brought the moon to us,\ncame down and joined us and said how those ship was broke so they have to live with us now.\n\n\n====== REC023.txt ======\nbut it's broke. Speaking of moon, do you know what the roach limit is? This is really cool.\nThe roach limit. You know what it is? Okay. Cool. So let me explain it. So the moon,\nI'll just explain it in an abstract concept. You're in a more of a red cone way.\nSo the planet itself and the moon, if the moon gets too close,\nit's not going to hit the planet, it'll actually hit the roach limit.\nAnd what the roach limit does is that it pulls apart the moon using centrifugal forces.\nThe pull apart does it, the reaction of the earth's been used to it, and the moon's been used to it.\nIt's like, you have like, yeah, it's like you're fucking, the moon gets destroyed in terms of the ring.\nSo then what if you can use that ring? What if you could defend the earth, right?\nFrom the impacts that are coming. Using glist of missiles or whatever.\nWe can have a lot easier to mind that shit, huh?\nImagine that. Imagine if we can destroy the rocks as they're incoming,\nbut we can collect them with a collector that's off the planet.\nThat's also meant to, oh my god.\nDo we know for sure that there's value?\nHey, why haven't we noticed yet? Why haven't we made like a net and kind of thrust down,\nhow the hell didn't the lower atmosphere and thrust downward?\nWe built a net over the planet out of a super affordable, durable material\nthat can grapple on their objects. It can be electromagnetic.\nYou can make it a electromagnetic net.\nYeah, and we can catch all the minerals needed, but it might have to be a tangible net too.\nIt means the metal.\nYeah, dude, it'd be perfect.\nWe collect all the materials, all the debris that's circulating in the system,\nand we can also collect all the moon dust that we create by bringing the bright,\nby bringing the moon closer.\nThose ships are actually running right now.\nThey're making good progress.\nHumanity is not excited enough to explore the moon anyway.\nThat's weird. I won't blow it up with that.\nI won't blow it up with that.\nIt's like, holy shit, that's cool.\nI want that net. That'd be amazing.\nOh, I hate it.\nYou can set it up.\nYou could hypothetically detonate the bigger pieces that survive the roach limit, breakage.\nDon't worry about it. Let's just go there now.\nGo to the center, pack a shit tunnel.\nWell, go as deep as we can.\nPack a shit tunnel and expose a lot of it so it's facing the middle of the way.\nYou can be fucking fun, dude.\nYou can wait for a full moon, right?\nWatch like 10 nukes in one spot and just fucking shit.\nYou're like, I was thinking about that a lot.\nYou can see a few of you guys.\nLook cities that don't pay.\nJust take his net out here.\nThey just have helicopters involved.\nThis red neck entertainment in space, dude.\nThat's what I'm talking about.\nThat's what I'm talking about.\nThat's what I'm talking about.\nThat's what I'm talking about.\nThat's what I'm talking about.\nThat's what I'm talking about.\nThat's what I'm talking about.\nThat's what I'm talking about.\nThat's what I'm talking about.\nThat's what I'm talking about.\nThat's what I'm talking about.\nThat's what I'm talking about.\nThat's what I'm talking about.\n\n\n====== REC024.txt ======\nImagine this. Imagine you have in the future. Imagine you have the earth encircled by this and that.\nYou had the net pushing outwards collecting all the debris at the moon, but at the same time...\nYou could synchronize that with each point of satellite, which would be...\nOh my god, it's a great idea. That way you have... like Elon's most satellites, right?\nBut they're not satellites, they're actually...\nThere's a lot lower flight satellites than that.\nBut then you need tethers that go outwards to keep the net in place.\nYeah, like a grid. And you have the tethers...\nIt's kind of like a polygon grid.\nYeah, yeah. But then that's a good analogy. It's a visual example of that.\nI'm trying to imagine it, and you have a circular polygon grid.\nIt is a collection... it collects debris. It creates satellite points that actually...\nOr fix satellite points.\nAnd then you have...\nIt fills out you're not disconnected from the others.\nThat's it.\nWow, okay.\nFuck cell phones, fuck...\nAnd this is the ultimate internet.\nThis is the ultimate connection.\nNo, you wouldn't need phone services then, like Verizon or shit, because you just get it from that.\nYeah, you didn't... the net that we're using actually...\nOkay, so imagine this net is below the roast limit.\nRight, it's not going to affect it.\nBut then you have this...\nThat's true.\nBut then you have... just in case it gets stuck part of the damage.\nYou have to push it, and then it's re-verified or real, by the way.\nThis is all I selected for this interpretation.\n\n\n====== REC025.txt ======\nYesterday, actually, I work.\nUm, or today.\nSo the opening scene for him, I wanted to be dealing with his hands, perhaps, in front of him.\nBut I wanted to figure out...\nSo imagine the E.I, right?\nHave you seen...\nIt is, it is...\nOkay, that's the movement?\nYeah, that's probably a good...\nAt the beginning.\nYou saw the reference.\nThe white body, yeah.\nYeah, yeah.\nBut imagine it having holes, imagining it being...\nWay too efficient, too.\nYou don't need all that machinery, right?\nNo, no.\nYou don't need all the empty space.\nLike humans have.\nYou can make these...\nYou can make these almost like...\nAlmost like super low-estor genomes.\nImagine like a...\nA last scene...\nA last scene that I had...\nA structure about...\nYeah, but those are clunky, right?\nThere's no other than the new one that they have.\nIt has a...\nDefined chest piece.\nYeah, like...\nOh, oh!\nAnd then the legs and the bones will come off and the less material, but the chest piece is super-defined.\nImagine you have...\nYou have a shape like that, but it's a little more triangular.\nOkay.\nSo it's like a humanoid formula.\nSo it's close to...\nBut it doesn't have a joint body.\nIt doesn't have like...\nIt has tubes...\nOkay.\nIt doesn't have like an internal structure.\nYeah.\nOr does, but there are...\nMaybe it's like a chest piece structure.\nIt's not like those are holes.\nIt's a magic...\nYeah.\nBut imagine that you have chest piece here.\nThis is like...\nThere are...\nThere are organs, all the processing stuff.\nAnd they're head.\nSo you have the dough deck inside the head of the brain.\nIs that a human shape?\nBut the dough deck inside the brain?\nInside the head of the structure.\nIs that good?\nIs that good?\nIs that good?\nYeah.\nThe neck.\nSo...\nFor the broken dough deck, like a piece, I want to ask you...\nDoes the piece look like normal dough decks?\nDoes it look like normal dough decks?\nIt's white.\nThere's...\nIt has white surface, yeah.\nSo it's white, not bad.\nYeah.\nIt's...\nWhen it...\nIt's like raised out.\nAs it loses energy, it raised out.\nYeah.\nWell, I'm talking about the ones that...\nBecause I want...\nIsn't those two that they have to connect to the form of the piece?\nIs that why they're going to do ones that they need to combine them for a puzzle or something?\nBecause we're talking about having the unique pieces of the dough deck puzzle that they needed.\nBut they didn't realize that there were more than one piece still.\nBut I don't know if you want to do that.\nBecause it was before we had the protocol.\nSo I think...\nYou've had the idea of having the keys, right?\nYeah.\nYou wanted to put them on the door of the structure.\nYou want to put them on like...\nThis is the data storage of humanity.\nYou can...\nIt's pretty grave, really.\nIt's up there.\nIt's up there.\nPeople...\nThere are keys, but they're also information.\nWell, it's trying to...\nOkay, sir.\nNo, it's...\nEnergy.\nEnergy is the basic dough deck that I could use.\nBut before I start any more describing it, I want to know what it actually is.\nBecause when we came up with this idea, we didn't have a description except for it's a dough deck.\nSo does it look like a conventional dough deck?\nOr is there a uniqueness to it?\nIt is a conventional dough deck.\nOkay.\nSo the mathematical sense.\nBut it feels the same.\nIt feels the same.\nYeah.\nAppearance wise.\nOkay.\nIt looks good, though.\nBecause it's...\nI don't think I'm ready with for him.\nIt's...\nHey, man, this team thinks it's broken.\nBut...\nSo what I'm thinking here, that's the point.\nSo...\nWhat if it's...\nIt's a perfect structure.\nIt's dense as any object can be.\nBecause it's so dense, you can't actually cut your hand to cut your hand to touch again.\nNo, it's not that sharp.\nIt's not that precise.\nWell, no, no.\nBut it's not...\nIt's...\nIt's curved with the edges.\nYeah.\nIs this just...\nNo, maybe it may be sharp edges.\nWell, no.\nIt's not about like that.\nI was just trying to...\nSo I imagine that they have a dough deck.\nBut I was trying to figure out...\nIs there something that sets it apart from the other dough deck?\nSo there's a little bit of the other dough deck.\nHmm.\nLike, is there...\nNo big...\nLook, these are specials that we don't understand.\nWhat sort of each dough deck has an emotion?\nNot an emotion, as I...\nAs I...\nAs I treat...\nAs one of those...\n12 traits.\nOh, it has...\nThese two, right?\nOkay, so there's...\nI imagine a strison.\nHmm.\nSo, um...\nOh.\nHang on.\nLet me try...\nTry and stay on this.\nBecause one kind of figure out is...\nImagine...\nHe's got the dough deck.\nDid you see the symbols?\nIn the...\nIn the...\nIn the...\nIn the feed?\nThe feed for, uh...\nA bread of nymphs.\nThe, uh...\nThis word...\nI did that.\nOh, it's a...\nI guess that...\nAnd the boring line.\nOkay.\nOh, okay, that was done.\nThat's what we had.\nSo...\nBut yeah, so...\nThese here, we have...\nAggression.\nApprehension.\nMisery.\nElation.\nAversion.\nAttraction.\nPain.\nPleasure.\nShame.\nBride.\nUh, it wasn't only, oh, it was, um...\nIn the...\nIn the...\nIn the enmity.\nIn the enmity.\nIn the empathy.\nIn the middle of the hair, you have...\nIt's a...\nIt's a...\nIt's a gradient of human expression.\nAnd now, if human expression is shown in the face,\na lot of it's shown on...\nYour...\nYour language...\nThrough the tone of voice.\nThrough the internal processes in the back of your mind,\nyou're not expressed in others.\nUh, they're not necessarily strict.\nThey're not strictly taught.\nThis is more of an abstraction.\nBut, uh, this is...\nA little gradient.\nYeah.\nSo, um...\nAnd then, contentness, or being content,\nis in the center.\nBut also in the center, there is...\nThe fashion.\nOh, okay, yeah.\nAnd then, the only issue is really content,\nor...\nPotentially depressed if you're not getting the social aspect of the film.\nI'm not contenting the social aspect, I don't know.\nWell, because I'm trying to figure out\nif there's a reason these singlet up is their deck.\nBecause I know what I'm currently running with is...\nLet's say, oh, in.\nIt looks like the other dodecks.\nOkay.\nSo, imagine this works for all intents and books.\nImagine all dodecks.\nBook, book.\nImagine all dodecks can have 12 faces,\nwith the symbols on them.\nYeah.\nBut a lot of them want to have one.\nDo you have promotions?\nYou have these AI\nthat can't really express anything with one.\nMaybe two, they can start to talk a little bit, like babies.\nRight?\nThey can interact with some dodecks.\nThey can make peaks and whistles.\nBut then you have stage three in that screen occasion.\nBut these are still still pictures and whistles,\nbut a lot more advanced.\nBecause I got to keep the scope small.\nYeah.\nI get just to keep it a little more abstract.\nI'll show you how to...\nI'll show you how to keep the most...\nBecause those advanced beeps will sound like...\nBut you have these steps of language,\nthese steps of communication,\nand that the expression of dodecks,\nprobably the best expression.\nBut it doesn't mean full fulfillment.\nThe fulfillment is different from just progression\nand locking more spheres, more and more.\nI guess no one kind of does.\nBecause you are getting aptitude\nin the native end direction.\nThat would be the explanation.\nSo...\nWho is the fourth description of a devil like I did?\nWhat are these...\nDo you imagine the symbols here?\nDo you want to show it before, right?\nDid I...\nDid I explain this to you?\nI had it all.\nNo, I don't think so.\nThe last one, the last one, the last one is...\nOh.\nLet's use this one.\nThis one's good.\nThat's the last one I have to do, right?\nTry these yourself, or...\nI got an artist.\nMission them.\nWow, that's loud.\nI'm coughing in the mic.\nI've got so many years later.\nWell, because I know what a...\nWhat's going on around me is...\nAll the tens of focuses that dodecks they have\nshould work.\nBut they can't figure out why it doesn't work.\nThese are the dodecks, so energy and information.\nThey are information, but also energy and things.\nThese are the dodecks, so energy and information are correct.\nThey are information, but also energy and things.\nThey are equals something squared, they are.\nYeah.\nEqual power energy, and...\nWell, if they will kind of like a data chip.\nDense structures.\nI was going to have it be like a data chip.\nYou can store stuff on them, but they produce this energy also,\nso you don't have to use it for one of the other.\nYou can use it for both.\nWell, at least because you said the symbols are incorrect.\nYou know, I think...\nWell, imagine them being processors, right?\nCPUs, they're the most powerful things you can ever imagine,\nbut they're not AI.\nThey don't believe in the AI, but they can become AI.\nBecause they're so dense, because these structures are so granular.\nThe brain...\nYeah, one thing can become a brain.\nOne of these things.\nBut they're really just...\nHow do they react?\nThey...\nAt first, they react like a little animal, you know,\nthey're running around.\nI mean...\nImagine at first they're...\nThey're more of a dog or cat.\nNo, no.\nIn terms of movement.\nThey're more of a...\nThey're mobile.\nThey can change their form.\nThey can change their form.\nThey can be a big dog, like structure or a...\nA monkey-like structure, you know.\nBut they can't be large enough.\nThey can't be...\nThey can't be advanced enough to be fully aware.\nLike, human.\nOr fully advanced, like, human.\nBut they're not...\nBut humans aren't even fully advanced enough.\nThey're not fully done.\nKeep going.\nBecause they're not...\nSo what I was writing with is,\nhe's got the dough deck in the lab.\nThey don't know why it's not...\nDoing anything.\nIt's just sitting there.\nIt gives off energy, like, it should work.\nBut it's not interacting, like, as the other dough decks would interact.\nAnd so that's why I...\nSo, dude...\nImagine, okay, that's interesting.\nOkay, let's say it's tier...\nTier 3, tier 4.\nThat's the basic...\nThe basic human.\nThey're social.\nAnd they're...\nThey're expression.\nIn the...\nAggression and anxiety.\nFasats.\nOr multiple.\nMaybe it's like five or six.\nI don't know how many it takes to be...\nBasic human, do you think?\nSorry.\nNo problem.\nI'm just doing it.\nWithout...\nOkay, imagine...\nOkay, just for clarification.\nFor...\nLet's look at this.\nImagine these structures are...\nYou were grabbing 12 at the time, right?\nThat was 12, right?\nI bet that's it.\nThey're not eight right now.\nI need any four more.\nThey're not expressed here.\nBut, uh, it's a dough deck.\nNo, no, excuse me.\nIt was 103, it said...\nI know that.\nYeah, and then you have...\nExactly.\nAnd you're only on lock one at a time.\nBut...\nWhat do you mean what do you own lock?\nUnlock is in, like, uh...\nImagine the AI could get more advanced.\nIt's not like a baby, right?\nOkay, so...\nIt's a little scratch.\nIt's a zero from one that you got to...\nA fully human expression.\nSo the dough deck still has...\nSo it's also a stationary object.\nAnd then, as you slowly interact with it,\nit still leads to the most normal.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nSo I didn't realize that they were going to have a side\nwith a moving.\nI thought this was a truly stationary object.\nUh, it is at first,\nbut then it advances...\nIt's a mold building.\nAnd then...\nExpression.\nSo fully...\nNo, I can use that then to explain why they have it.\nYeah.\nSo there's, like, an AI version of it.\nLike, a full lot of humanoid kind of thing.\nAnd that's the thing with the line of scissors, right?\nThe tubular structures in the body.\nWell, because I was trying to figure out,\nwhat is this problem of understanding the dough deck\nbefore I get to that scene?\nThey say that they may wear these things there,\nthey don't know how they exist,\nthey don't know how they became these machines.\nBecause they're so long.\nSo it's not very different...\nWhat about you in the years?\nAlmost planet.\nAnd they believe that...\nHuh?\nSo you said the easiest things for energy,\nis that all they do is...\nThe easiest things?\nThe ones that are not formed yet,\nare used for energy.\nAnd...\nBecause these things are not functional.\nThey...\nThey're...\nI gotta get a question,\nfrom these dough deck machines towards the people there,\nusing those things that do mean that it's fine.\nThat it is fine.\nThey're not going to rage over it.\nI think that's how they become,\nbecause they're locking these spaces,\nthey grow into humans,\nthey get to socialize,\nthey get to interact with you.\nSo because they lock it in,\nthey can get to experience,\nand they experience them in some locks.\nYeah.\nThey take through experience,\nthey become more human.\nThey become more AI that learn,\nthat teach themselves how to be more naturalistic.\nOkay.\nI'm good then.\nThat's so embarrassing to be honest.\nI needed to explain why is he looking at this door?\nI didn't want to talk to the reason it had to be her own.\nBecause I'm trying to figure out why I'm here.\nI'm here for the half of this door deck.\nI still have the new book on the right.\nI spent a few people less.\nThere's a lot.\nSo how many of these non-walking dodecks will we get?\nHow many things should be on the door?\nHow many things are interesting?\nAre there 12 side dodecks?\nAre there 12 side dodecks?\nAre there 36 or 50 or 100?\nLet's say there's 12 in the door.\nLet's say there's multiple.\nWhat's another interesting number?\nNot 42.\nIf you have 72?\nYou have 12.\n12 symbols.\nYou have 12 sides.\nWhat is the common denominator?\nWhat do you call it?\nThere are prime numbers, right?\nWhat is the prime number of 12?\nI feel cool.\nOkay, that's...\nWhat we're talking about is we don't want to make it too complex,\nbut we don't want to make it too easy.\nWe don't want to make it too trophy.\nWhat is the prime number of 12?\nSomething that's avoided the prime number of 12.\nAccording to the math form,\nhowever, 12 is not a prime number\nbecause one asterisk 12 equals 12,\ntwo asterisk 6 equals 12,\nand three asterisk 4 equals 12.\nPrime factorization means finding all the prime numbers\nthat are factors of a number.\nTwo, if the last digit is even,\nthe number is divisible by two.\nOkay, so, all right, that's bad at all.\nSo, here's something, man.\nHow many of the out of the 12 symbols,\nwould you say, one of the most known ones\nthat you absolutely need?\nAbsolutely need.\nSo, because these are behaviors,\nI think that interaction takes aggression anxiety.\nLike in a cat or a dog, there is, you know,\nthe hiss, anxious,\nthey can get it.\nWell, they need to talk about a lot,\nfight them more like a puzzle.\nThe thing is, he's in the low aggression,\nlow anxiety state.\nHe is calm.\nHe's in between.\nWell, because how many doors are there,\njust the one that they found?\nThere are four doors on each structure.\nSo, when it's entered to build the entire city\nall the way around.\nOkay.\nAnd then you have, maybe, maybe six.\nWell, also, if you do six doors on the structure,\nthen I would, when I recommend,\nis breaking it down through to a door.\nIt had to be that those in arrangement,\nthey have to figure out,\nfor all six structures.\nOh, that's big of it.\nOh, that's big of it.\nEach door, as you said, those four doors.\nYeah.\nThose 12 symbols.\nSo, you put three to each door.\nYou have to have each door a lineup of the other ones,\nkind of, I guess, your dog proposal about the emotional thing.\nAnd somehow you have to figure out the message\nthat it's conveying to you inside.\nThat's a really, oh my god, it's like a Metroidvania.\nIt's like, instead of, like, unlocking doors\nto unlock the next area,\nyou're unlocking doors to the next section of the world.\nImagine going beyond the walls.\nWell, saying it, but you don't need to do a puzzle that way.\nYou could just have it be that it's a message\nthat they're coding, not a stupid puzzle.\nThis is the puzzle you're trying to develop in your game,\nbecause I came into conversation late.\nYeah, those look like concepts for the destinies.\nOh, so,\nthis is a stuff I have kind of large to do.\nAll right.\nThat was level concepts.\nYeah, it's a hub world concept.\nIt's a hub world concept.\nMeaning Chris, I'm trying to help him flesh out the board\na little more with detail,\nkind of like, concept writing.\nRight, I mean, yeah.\nSo what I'm doing here is I'm doing, you know,\nstill a little five to six out of the screenplay,\nsoft with snippets and information he's giving me.\nSo we can do a dry run to see if it flows naturally.\nHe's having to vote characters.\nBecause a lot of it is character interaction.\nAnd so we want to see if the interaction\nhe has in mind.\nSo a physical one is we're doing that.\nWe're using these interactions to flesh out the details\nabout the character.\nSo Leo, I want to pitch this to you, okay?\n\n\n====== REC026.txt ======\nWell, I know, but I wanted to give you an idea of how I wanted to do this.\nSo, in a way that's articulate, because I've had a really hard time explaining this to friends, because it's complex.\nHopefully, in person it helps.\nSo, imagine that during conversation.\nIt's not just a text box, you want to add that to a tree, right?\nNo, no, no, it's more of...\nYou have...\nOkay, so for production wise, there are two characters, two actors, two scientists, two philosophers, two artists, whatever.\nThey're talking and communicating, right, to each other.\nBut then, I record the entire conversation.\nThey're in the entire conversation, but then I let the player, or like you, or let me ask questions from that conversation, like commentary to it, really.\nAnd then you present those questions to the people that talk, and they give you tangents.\nThey give you the next layer of information, and then you can ask...\nYeah, based on your questions.\nAnd then you add another layer of questions, and then you do it again.\nAnd then you clarify to the precise degree that someone should communicate.\nIf you have, get a shot, try out a wolf.\nI like the chat system.\nI'm not there yet, but I will.\nI bought it. I haven't played it yet.\nI want to call it your first.\nWhen I talk to the AI, I found out that those whole questions I could unlock just by if I keep talking and paying attention to the AI.\nSo I interacted with a bunch of people.\nThis is the fourth mission in town.\nI had the choice of just any mission.\nBut as I talked to them, you find out that they're cutting the food with extra shit because they don't have enough fish.\nAll they eat this fish, and it doesn't play now.\nAnd I found this out talking to some random sidekick.\nYeah, that's a good idea.\nAnd then I had a choice.\nI could completely ignore the food issue.\nAnd while I could talk to him, go, hey, why are you people getting sick?\nBecause I found a golden.\nAnd if you found the golden, and then you talk to me, you can mention I found a golden.\nWe can use their food.\nBut then you find out he has a rivalry with that lady.\nAnd you can actually convince that dude, because he wants to see what it succeeds like.\nIf you leave, she'll bring her food.\nYou can actually convince this guy to leave the town, because this guy is going to bring her food.\nLeo, could you come up with a story like that, but for this world?\nLike, so you're going to be at the end.\nThe issue is going to be the AI.\nOkay.\nAnd then those social adversaries are going to have to figure out a lot more.\nBecause literally all we have for those social adversaries is some greetings, the family make up.\nAnd then we have some side interaction.\nAnd we have to figure out how do they react to stressful events?\nMotivations will like, why would they even be stressful?\nBecause you said that they don't really have a need for currency.\nYeah, there's no currency.\nThere's no vehicles.\nPeople that be social, these close-knit social spaces.\nImagine that you're...\nViolent is very minimal violence, minimal stealing, rape murder, whatever it is.\nYeah, it's utopian in the literal sense.\nBut there's also small issues.\nIt's not perfect.\nAnd that's why it hasn't been fully filled out.\nWhen you have that kind of civilization, it's not like a prime directive to me.\nThink of a stole check.\nBecause you're all helping.\nYou're giving information, you're giving them cross-bar energy at the same time.\nBut think of stole check.\nThey didn't really have a whole lot of internal conflict.\nIt wasn't brought down outside species.\nYour biggest issues, you limited yourself to two species.\nYeah, no, they're not.\nOh geez.\nDo I want to spoil it?\nChristian?\nI don't know if I want to spoil it.\nChristian.\nCan you probably get a forget all the shit that the game comes out of?\nYeah, deep.\nDo you want another spoiler or do you want to...\nAll right, I go for it.\nOkay, I don't even know what to throw.\nAll right.\nHe's already alive.\nOkay, okay.\nYou're right.\nJump into the middle.\nIt's just a man.\nYou can still find awe in this.\nOh, you're giving me the ending base.\nI'm giving the ending.\nOkay.\nNo, that's good.\nYou need an ending.\nOkay.\nSo...\nThe AI.\nThey are not avalians.\nThey are of humanity.\nThe colonies that arrived here found these structures.\nThey were curious.\nThey were amazed.\nThey were awestruck by them.\nThey tried to figure out what they were.\nCouldn't find a means to get inside the structures.\nCouldn't figure out how to...\nHow did I break down these...\nWhat they think to be...\nIt is technology, but they haven't found a way to access it.\nThey can use their energy, but they can't actually control these machines that come from them.\nRight.\nIt's like giving a fucking motorcycle to some monkeys.\nThey might figure out how to turn the key, but they don't know how to help work.\nYep.\nThat's pretty good knowledge, actually.\nSo pretty much what's happened is the colony ship was sent to the planet.\nBoth sent something ahead of them to build for them to be ready when they got there.\nSo imagine you're traveling two and a thousand years now.\nThey underestimated the ability of the machines.\nSo by the time that the humans got here, the machines had laid this grand thing and it shut off.\nAs well as the humans though.\nSo now they've arrived on this planet with these massive, unknown structures.\nBut we don't know who made them.\nHow the fuck they're there or what they do.\nBut in reality, they're...\nThey've been living by them for a little amount of time gathering these dotics,\nwhich are like these 12 side of things.\nAnd we deal with these wonderful things, but at the end of the day,\nthey realize we don't know what the fuck they do, but we're using them anyway.\nAnd by using them, they run off to this AI that has now went from this donut\nto an active amongst the body, the inner ax of them, and has grown up beside them.\nAnd now together they're trying to figure out what is the purpose of this town.\nBut for these, it is only the most centuries fascinating through fantastic concept.\nAnd the twist is...\nOptimistic utopian people find out, oh, we made this.\nYeah, but it's humanity that we lost contact with all of those years ago.\nYeah, so right now, what ancient civilization is?\nTechnically.\nOkay, this is interesting.\nSo the civilization before them is catching a younger.\nThey're after this generation.\nThey're the older ones, human understanding.\nBut that's not how it works at all.\nIt's actually reverse.\nOlder ones thrive longer than that.\nFader.\nSo the species that mounted on old, because they grew up in the unique environment,\nworks the after-technology from...\nThey can live like...\nThey don't have a normal lifespan.\nThey hold for like thousands of years.\nSo by the time they've reached here, they're from the fourth group,\nbut in the second group, right?\nYeah, I mean, you'd say there's like...\nThere's less of them.\nThey're not immune from decay.\nBut...\nBut the generations that have made it to the planet don't realize that the sharks that they found,\nthey think that they found evidence of another life.\nRight.\nLike, what they're thinking is this is an alien race.\nAnd right now, they're thinking either they got wiped out by wolves,\nor they abandoned this for some reason.\nBut then...\nWell, he's working as a scientist character.\nBut I mean, you want to flesh out a character,\nand you want to give this guy a background of personality,\na purpose in the world.\nSo imagine that they're in this world, because it's utopian,\nbecause there are no choms.\nThere's no automation everywhere.\nMachines are not taking over the world.\nWe built machines, and they did as well.\nThey served to help humanity.\nAnd they're not like slaves, because they aren't sentient.\nThey're just machines. They're just.\nBut then you have the donax that are sentient.\nWe have decided against using these.\nWe understand that they're beings.\nWe understand that they communicate.\nWe don't want to slave them.\nWe let them free.\nLet them be free, because they haven't caused violence to have them.\nDon't anything...\nThat's your secondary race.\nYeah, the secondary race.\nThe player race.\nAlso the...\nThe main character.\nDo we interact the world?\nThat's going to be the...\nAnother trip you asked.\nYeah, so...\nThe way that the nodex slope is,\nyou'll give it a body,\nand typically it's with a family you've made an arrangement with.\nAnd you start on that basic body,\nand as you interact, you go in and unlock pieces.\nSo what if...\nWhat if...\nJust a little more awestruck.\nYou see these...\nMysterious machines that are wondering about.\nYou see these...\nThese...\nThe tendrilike structures.\nThese are the other players,\nbut you don't have that body yet.\nYou're just a dodeck.\nYou don't realize that that's you.\nYou are one of those machines.\nSo I imagine like you have...\nOh, a fashion-like machine.\nYou're walking around.\nThis is what he believes,\nbut they might know that they have a dodeck inside them.\nThey haven't grown out yet.\nBut at the same time,\nthere's like a...\nThey don't know how to become that thing,\nand they don't fully grasp that they are that thing.\nThey may not believe it entirely.\nMaybe it's not expressed to them anyway.\nThey really become that...\nImagine...\nYeah, they're interaction.\nImagine that a human attached parts, David.\nImagine this dodeck and it can spiral out tendrils.\nIt can reach, reach, it can grasp.\nIt can almost become a dog or cat relative to us.\nIt just doesn't understand how to...\nIt's not there yet.\nIt doesn't have enough...\nIt hasn't broke down. It's consciousness.\nIt hasn't become more...\nIt's like that.\nThere's something consciousness through it.\nThe thing is, the dodeck,\nwhen it stokes out,\nit stokes as a small thing,\nprobably sounds like this.\nIt doesn't realize that...\nIt doesn't realize that these things are bodies.\nSo, what he's trying to say is,\nthe beginning is he stowed off of this little body.\nAnd the dodecks have no knowledge of his shoes.\nSo, they have to run everything from the other dodecks.\nSo, these things are open and sitting.\nThe camera criticism is for that ball.\nAnd you get to see all these big machines,\nlike people like walking around.\nThese machines and the walls.\nImagine if you're replaying it, then you realize,\non your fullscreen thing, you're going to see.\nYou're like, whoa.\nThere are always people.\nAnd then it's going to score this one.\nAnd then, as you play through the game,\nthose are you.\nThat's your race.\nAnd so,\nhe's holding it out.\nWell, you stowed off thinking of one of the human derivatives.\nWell, not necessarily.\nI mean, you're in the background.\nNow, aren't you?\nI was going to assume that they're the organic one,\nnot the machines,\nbecause that's never going to be done.\nAnd then he gave you,\nyou're not going to show yourself in a demeanor.\nAnd you're just going to be.\nNo, you could.\nNot a first.\nI mean, yeah.\nThat's good.\nYou can hit it for a while.\nFirst twist.\nOkay.\nI couldn't look in the mirror.\nWow.\nWhat is that?\nOh, between you, like a robot.\nOh, shit.\nIt's like an HP Lovecraft.\nYeah.\nGetting the castle out, God.\nBut it would run away.\nAnd he's like,\noh, shit.\nThere's a monster.\nGoes up and he's like,\noh, it's me.\nOh, my God.\nThat'd be a good trailer.\nImagine, like, you're talking to the right,\nand then you're like,\noh, whoa, whoa.\nWhoa.\nIt's a Lovecraft.\nIt's Tendrils.\nDude, that grilled blind stuff.\nHow about how you live in the mirror?\nAnd you walk to a party.\nAnd you're like, this guy,\nand he's like, wow.\nAnd if you can see him,\nthey go, oh, my God,\nthere's a monster.\nAnd he starts freaking out.\nLook, shit, there's a monster.\nEveryone starts running away.\nAnd he starts running.\nAnd he comes up to what he thinks is a doorway.\nAnd he freezes.\nAnd he realizes that it's a mirror,\nbecause he touches it.\nAnd he's like, oh, fuck.\nI'm just hitting his monster, shit.\nHe went around thinking he thought it wasn't normal for us.\nAnd then,\nhow long he thought he was normal,\nwent to this party,\nand went flipped on him.\nHow long is until a player sees his other mirror?\nUntil he sees his body for the first time.\nYou can,\nimagine.\nImagine, imagine,\nthey take it to the end.\nI don't know.\nImagine they see it.\nYou guys want to get the player\nat the about your explore.\nThis world, right?\nHave you seen it before?\nSo...\nFraction?\nIt's a shit movie,\nbut it has an amazing twist.\nSo tell me,\nit's Thomas West.\nYou spend this whole movie thinking this guy's wife\nand daughter were kidnapped by a hospital.\nThe way that they set it up is\nyou see things for organ chance fight.\nAnd this dude's had an accident where he's fallen\nand his daughter was born.\nAnd his hospital was giving him a run around.\nBut he finally gets him checked in.\nAnd they're finally all going through.\nAnd he...\nAppears to pass out on a bench.\nHe waits back up\nand the hospital's telling him\nwe don't have your family registered here.\nThe shift is left\nand the next shift is there.\nNo way, dude.\nYou don't have a family here.\nGet the fuck out.\nSo he leaves.\nComes back.\nGets arrested.\nHe rinses the cops.\nHe kidnapped his family.\nThey go to where this accident happened\nand the twist is he killed them.\nFlipped.\nThrough the bodies in the trunk.\nJoke himself to the hospital.\nThought he checked them into the hospital.\nKilled all these doctors.\nAnd at the end of the movie,\nhe think he's found his wife\nand daughter runs him out of the hospital.\nThey're gathering the truck and it pans over\nand he's by himself in the court.\nIt is some random dude\nand scrubs thing on his seat.\nAnd he's just us today\nand he keeps going back\nand he sees wife and daughter dead in the court.\nBut the whole movie they made me look like\nhis family got kidnapped.\nSo if you control the narrative,\nthe player will make the assumption.\nSo all you have to do\nis avoid describing the character\nwhich is really easy\nin what you're going to be doing.\nJust have them talk about something else.\nYeah.\nBecause you said they're not a parents-based.\nSo it could be really easy\nto ignore that effect.\nYou don't have to hide from them for a long time.\nSo imagine.\nOkay.\n\n\n====== REC027.txt ======\nSo, imagine that they do know they are aware, but they're not aware first, they get a little\ntime to, okay now they always see me face around the thing, okay, so then NPCs sort of acknowledge\nthem as a thing, right, because they interact more, they use their hands almost, like they're\nmore expressive, they have a voice now, they have, you know, at first they were just observing,\nyou know, being recognized, they see it as like a little, a little, one of the creatures,\nright, but that's not fully developed, so they recognize it as like a baby or a cat or\na dog, yeah, but then eventually it starts talking, it starts communicating, you know,\nand then that expression, that language is already understood, because these things are\nso prevalent, all right, it's a language that is, you know, maybe not everyone understands\nit, you know, people will actually dedicate the time to understand a language, and that's\nwhy you can't talk to everyone, that's interesting, you can listen a lot of time, you can interaction\npeople at know your language, yeah, but some people know basic language, some people know\nit more advanced language, right, so I say, but if they don't know your language, they\njust be like, oh, I mean I can voice it, yeah, nothing to say there, so you talk to them\nlike, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, well a little bit, but it's a little more like, it's\nnot a little intelligence, it's just the overall inability to communicate between people that\nare different in different interests, no, I haven't, but I've seen some of the reactions\nof the low intelligence, you still have all your regular skills, but when it comes to like, talking, your dialect\nchoices on room, or just random pieces of dialogue, I think it's a little, I don't, I don't\nknow, that's my good sound, I don't think anyone is that dumb, all right, none of that, no, there's\nmore of a joke that you can do that's just true, I mean they have other, other, other intelligences\nthat are good at mechanic work, we were just, we were just told, we were trying to get rid of a shock\nat memory casinos, it's like all the downy pieces of my guy would just be like, yeah okay, we're\njust gonna shoot you now, I don't think you could do little voices, oh shit I forgot about that,\nyou could do little voices, you could do a little okay, so imagine a fashion like character,\nArchery Day character, right?\nOh, I see it going full.\nYou know, it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nHe wants a language of just no actual form of words.\nOh, I mean, you could do that with a piano.\nA piano might be beautiful, actually.\nYou need a piano.\nA synthesizer.\nLeo, that's... that's...\nWhat about a violin?\nMaybe you have an instrument, right?\nWell, you...\nWhat do I explain?\nIt's like a knob, a couple knobs in a switch.\nYou know, you hit a tone at that hold.\nAnd you just work it with your switch or your knob.\nOh, I don't know.\nI hit you.\nYou've got to show me that.\nI don't...\nSo...\nOh, man.\nOh, what are they called?\nSciShow.\nSciShow.\nDamn it.\nKeep going.\nSo here's what I'm wondering.\nHe said you're going to have colors, right?\nAnd sound.\nMm-hmm.\nWhat did you want to use for the bass or the sound that he wants?\nNatural noises, synthetic noises.\nI think I'd like...\nNaturalistic noises, but also...\nIt's so close to the ball calls.\nIt's exactly close.\nYeah, but there's all...\nBird calls, yeah, yeah.\nUm...\nYou know, more musical, in a sense.\nBut also, hang on, there's also this other thing.\nThey're musical.\nBut they're also this thing I'm trying to find a cheese.\nWell, it's a thing like this.\nThe bass is an dynamic.\nSo real bass, like...\nYou know, it's like...\nThey make a beep.\nIs it obviously mechanically bass noise?\nDo you want that?\nOr do you want something that I would be closer to?\nAnd it sounds like we're here in nature, right?\nSo close and stuff.\nYou know how we, um...\nThere's a spectrum of radio wavelengths, right?\nThere's actually a spectrum of that wavelength emitted from the aura.\nAnd there are these aura whistlers.\nI found it.\naura whistler.\nYeah.\nSo here's another thing you might want to think about for your species.\nGiving them more than five senses.\nOne of five senses?\nSo...\nIn...\nSome of the sci-fi bread.\nWhen they make the aliens, they make them to well...\nThe reason why they can't communicate with humans is because...\nThey don't use normal language.\nThey use like...\nA mix of dots and...\nDude.\nSounds.\nLike...\nI don't...\nThese three love crafts.\nOld ones, for example.\nThey don't have a vocal system.\nThese things have a series of tubes instead.\nThese things are above 60 hertz.\nYou can't hear them.\nOkay.\nYou can't hear them this phone.\nYeah.\nSpeakers of shit.\nDo you have a speaker that's...\nOh, TV.\nWhat are you doing to do?\nThese aura whistlers can't be heard via the shitty ass speakers of my phone.\nType in aura whistler.\nOh, it's almost a noise that the northern lights make.\nYes.\nExactly.\nThe spectrum, the spectrum that we can interpret as some...\nIt's not...\nYeah.\nWhat is it?\nYou can test the rest of the X or some shit like that.\nOh, from the terminal.\nI should search again.\nSo, what he's going for is...\nHis AI communicate through sound code.\nThis should be SRX.\nNumber number number.\nSee him?\nHow do you...\nThat damn phone.\nIs that a password?\nIt's...\nAh boy, see...\nIs it on your computer?\nYeah, it's on your computer.\nIt's on your computer.\nOr it works on your computer?\nNo.\nOpen your laptop.\nThe computer?\nNo, what else?\nI don't want to see you want to try this or you want to try this\nI'll try more of that and I won't do it like that\nSo for the day I only wear\nAre they wearable?\nThat's a puzzle\nThey are wearable?\nThey are\nIt's not an intentional puzzle\nIt's because they dismantle the structure\nBut it's all known as intentional\nI don't mean like that\nSo we know that they don't know the history\nDo they have any idea of how the door works?\nLet's say they've gotten the hint that it works\nLet's say the door\nNo, no, I think the thing is here\nThere's my question\nDo they know it's a door they're trying to open\nThey see it as a door\nThey believe it as a door\nIt's not explicitly a door\nDo they know all the doors are connected?\nThey don't know\nDo they see the symbols?\nDo they see the doors?\nDo they see six?\nThey make the pattern that all these doors are open\nYou know, they're humans\nThey're intuitive, they're...\nI don't know how they do on the connection\nbetween pattern on the doors and pattern on the doughnuts\nSomehow opening the doors\nNo\nOkay, see that's what I'm gonna figure out\nBecause I'm about ready to go\nWell, he's talking about his research\nSo I'm just gonna know how much do they know\nSo I don't fuck up the answers\nMaybe they don't...\nThey can't find a way to get these door next to\nSo what I've been running with is we have the doughnut\nBut I'm gonna have it\nWell, maybe the player has some kind of a puzzle\nMaybe the missing piece for something\nIt was that you need to have a human collaborator\nand a doughnut collaborator\nBecause the doughnuts were made of flour\nOh, that's hers\nOkay\nSo we have the doughnuts were made from the thing\nRight?\nBut my question was\nThey do\nLet me show you my computer\nLet me show you my computer\nYou have sound, come on\nIt's no sound\nThey do\nThey do have sound\nHe's fucking it less\nNo, I'm not fucking you guys\nThey do have sound\nYou gotta come over\nYou gotta show you my fucking headphones\nand my DAG amp\nAmp fire and a digital audio converter\nSo it's more precise than these things\nMy phone especially\nYeah, we're probably gonna need some more later\nThere you go\nSo\nI'm gonna take that one\nand set it up\nI'm not even bringing that one\nIt seems like it\nIt's nice to see it all\nIt's nice to see it all\n\n\n====== REC028.txt ======\nWell,

know\nAll you need is Jesus and Trump, the Holy duo\nGuys, oh my god\nOh, is it as a passthrough saying in the cowboys?\nThe door's a door\nThat was a man\nWell, if it's still there, he knows I'm foolish at half the time\nI think it's so clear at going like anyone here is\nI'm trying to survive but I'm pretty loud in my room\nI'm safe\nOh\nBoom, boom\nDude, we got Opa Gadi today\nI know, you want to make a pussy, you blooms so bad\nWithout luck, a dog\nNo, not a cow\nBecause he wanted to capture my life of course\nSo he went into a tunnel with a bunch of his kids\nAnd when the US threw in the storm, he's like okay, hit the button, the blooms so bad\nWe don't like a dog\nSo Russia might have us by the bulls, they caught us, the leafly smuggling oil with food\nSome Terry's group\nBut thankfully it's just a little rest, I don't even know this\nSo right now we can fight him, but if they have hyenas, we'll fight\nI'm impressed he hasn't bitten me yet\nHe doesn't fight believe it or not\nHe's grown up finally\nHe used to be a vicious little feister\nDude, he's still an asshole\nI got a tank for sitting on the couch\nAlright, we're gonna play\nSo we're here to work your place?\nNo, we don't\nI really want to show you to see you here though\nCan you assault while you're projector?\nCan you split screen on my?\nYou can't, can we try that one?\nWe're going to fight against him\nCan we try that one?\nWe can't do...\nYeah, I can see from your spot\nDid I show you that?\nNo, I don't know, I know that\nCareful\nYou can not face the screen now with the players here\nNo, no, I mean, that's what it means trying to join you\nCan we do two people together?\nWe did both online\nWe did both\nAnd I'm group\nNo\nYou can't make the people survive in online\nLet's try it early\nWe're trying to connect you to me\nNo, we're not going to connect\nWe're trying to connect us to you\nNo, no, we're not going to do that\nWe're just going to use your side\nHave two people go online\nDoes he ever get up here?\nYes\nBut I'm going to give this round\nLet's get it\nI don't have to rush around\nBecause I want to see if you can do two players from this\nWe can, you can do two players here\nNo, I mean, do two players online?\nOkay\nSo it's the third one\nI think\nOkay\nLet's see\nI mean, I'll be sure to set up right\nBecause I was fighting, I thought I was fighting split screens on my own\nOkay\nSo that only means just which is\nThere's my remote level off\nIt's one of these ports\nIs it QLED or no LED?\nIt's OK\nIt's OK\nIt's OK\nThis is on the turn-off\nIt's OK\nOh, I'm ready to forget\nOh, I'm used to it, it's got a PC, I'm going to need it\nI was like, you know, it's like a controller, here we go\nIt's OK\nHow do I do it?\nI'm not supposed to control it\nVideo?\nAre you comfortable with the PlayStation control?\nOh, yeah\nWhat do you want to split screen?\nWhat we're going to see if we can do the split screen online and shoot players\nOr, no, it's just split screen campaign\nYep\nBecause everyone can do it\nI don't know, I have more fun shooting than the players\nAnyway, I like to screen them\nBecause they're easy to get around\nI was doing horses, I would drop two, and then his weight\nIf I didn't spot it, we would go to revive\nIt's OK\nOh, that's right\nI'm going to shoot later\nI'm going forward\nI'm going straight\nI'm going straight\nI'm going straight\nI'm going straight\nIt's OK\nThey're saving us up, they suck again.\nNow they're alone.\nYou see my fours open though?\nIs that something happened?\nI sure am.\nOne, two, three.\nThat's...\nCharlie, Charlie.\nThere you go.\nIs there a display there?\nThe 20 you're trying to connect to?\nTwo or one.\nI'm trying to connect to.\nIt seems like three is an on-the-zone.\nI'm not sure which one.\nI can't change the end for here.\nBecause I'm on my remote.\nI lost my remote.\nI can't find it.\nSo I've got to find a physical button.\nProbably on the inside.\nI don't think this is going to be useful actually.\nNo, I mean, you have...\nNo, I think there's more things on here that pop up with controller back here.\nCan you try to change the input?\nYeah.\nSettings, picture sound, channels.\nChannels.\nAnd the manager.\nThe first one.\nOkay.\nWhich one?\nThe fourth one and the other one.\nA little more of that.\nFucking circle, let me get it.\nRight there.\nRight there.\nBut then you have...\nI'd like to be an HDMI console.\nA console.\nA console.\nDesktop.\nI think it's through console.\nIs it working?\nYou need to plug in the computer.\nNo, you're right.\nHang on, I think you're right here.\nI think it's the console.\nI think I have block number one.\nAh-ha.\nShit.\nHoly shit.\nYou guys didn't smoke, dude.\nNo offense.\nDamn, that TV looks good.\nLook at that shit.\nThat fucking sharp is a damn knife.\nFuck, I'm loving it.\nThat's the...\nNo, I know, I want it.\nThat's hard to tell, right?\nIt's just...\nIt's just...\nIt's just...\nIt's just...\nIt's just...\nIt's just...\nYeah.\nI want one.\nOh my god, dude.\nIt's just like $1300 a month.\nIt's been about three grand on it.\nI bought it.\nThree grand T80.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nBut, um, I think that...\nThe price has gone down down.\nThere's TVs like...\nWait, a thousand.\nYeah.\nThe...\nI'm not even happy with $1300.\nYeah.\nBecause it's better for one.\nExcuse me.\nThe newer models are worth it, too.\nI don't think I'm putting it up.\nThis is for a great time, please.\nIt's like buying...\nYou know those big box TVs, haven't you?\nI'm not.\nI'm not.\nI'm not.\nWell, yeah, you can buy as soon as you buy it.\nIt's out of date.\nIt's out of date.\nYeah.\nIt's true.\nIt's on the market.\nAnyway.\nIt's pretty heavy.\nIt's worth it.\nUh, and then...\nRight.\nAnd then...\nBest out of the thing, guys.\nGot set up, right?\nAnd that turns on whenever...\nIt's port is activated.\nI'm pretty sure a lot of everything is here, too.\nAnd the question...\nWhat does that mean?\nWhy?\nIt's like my...\nI guess.\nPotion.\nWhat should we try it off?\nYou've got to dump love in the place.\nOtherwise, the controller's in a state synchronized to it.\nMm-hm.\nMm-hm.\nUgh.\nTao-chan.\nHero-cheateral.\n엎고�.\nYou got a reward.\nA Darkaar.\nThe Dark 2D.\nI have this thing where you can launch things right on the picture, it'll show you the display.\nSo I have this monitor, but then I go to the big picture mode, which is to not the slide, like this one here.\nBut they're all named generic PNP monitor.\nSo it's super mic.\nI'm sure this will change the names.\nIt's just a hassle.\nYeah.\nHopefully it's that one.\nIf it's not, it's not that one.\nOh, there's a solution.\nOkay, come on there.\nRuns of UT, that's already.\nYeah, I give them gold toys.\nYou know, whenever I thought, you love this stuff, man.\nIt seems like makeshift toys.\nYou know, like old strings or bits of card board.\nWhat do we want to start with?\nWhat do we swap?\nWhat do you feel?\nI feel I am.\nYes.\nBut no, I think I'm switching back to the green stuff.\nGreen free stuff.\nSo he's got half of that in there and half of that.\nHe's doing pretty good though.\nHe's got a lot of vitamins for his fur.\nThat's true.\nIt's just okay.\nIt's okay.\nIt is okay.\nThe other thing you gotta worry about with green free is they get fatter.\nThey eat too much.\nThen you might get some type of one for a minute.\nBut can you pick one out?\nIs he a little old man?\nOh, perfect.\nYes?\nOkay.\nHe's a healthy boy.\nThese two are a little thin.\nYou think the table isn't going to slow down for a time?\nYeah, probably.\nAnd then it might get too.\nAnd you know, you got to play it by ear.\nLike my last time he's had too fast and he lost with down to like 18 to 9 pounds.\nHe's a load even faster.\nYou know, what have I had?\nDid you think he'd try to feed a frisky thing?\nInteresting.\nSo what if I had like a bowl of the green free stuff?\nNot like a small bowl.\nI had like a larger bowl at the normal side.\nThat's fine.\nYeah.\nYou don't care to deal with your beer.\nYou'd have an easy, real easy time.\nIt doesn't go over either.\nYou eat as much as you need, so you eat as much as you want.\nAnd it takes like a fucking 30% of the bowl.\nWhich I like.\nI like too.\nWhat you could do is just feed them.\nOh, shit.\nIs it a two or a half?\nIt's because of the day you mix it up.\nSo dry and wet food.\nThat's not it.\nThe thing goes over with that time.\nIt's like the drying wet food.\nAnd that's after teeth.\nAnd that's how they ideally, I can't brush them.\nI don't know how.\nI can't think they'll learn.\nIdeally, the healthiest is just doing them wet food.\nI'm having sex, too.\nIt's not like you're in the shelter.\nAre you using a god?\nSure.\nI can.\nCatch this.\nOr nice thing.\nCheers.\nThat's it.\nThat's it.\nOK.\nThat's it.\nOh, no.\nYeah.\nThat's it.\nYeah.\nI'm having sex, too.\nThat's fine.\nYes.\nI'm having sex, too.\nIt's not.\nHold your hand.\nAre you using god?\nI'm taking it.\nIt touches me.\nSo...\nMaken!\nI...\nwant the stuff to be rich,\nas complicated as that.\nOkay, don't get any...\nSorry, sorry.\nLet me just..?\nSure, sure..\nYeah..\nOk, here.\nPerfect\nOh my Lord\npicture\nLet's take a little nice.\nOh wait, it's over it's over here, I'm going to change it in place

yellow?\nA purple bird before?\nIf it's a yellow bird, anyway, let's check this.\nLet's check this.\nFuck you guys.\nNo, I know.\nWe'll spend this on this TV lens.\nLike, shit.\nWell, it's only gonna be two people.\nThis fucking TV gives me a boner, dude.\nLet's try.\nAnd truckers here.\nIt's not gonna work if they...\nTrust me, let me see it too.\nWhat's the refresh rate on this one?\nIt's in the chancellor press.\nIt's 120.\nYou think everyone?\nNo, it's 60, actually.\nIt's just 60.\nYeah, I think that's...\nThat's the sacrifice.\nThat's the sacrifice, man.\nI'm gonna go higher, higher, higher.\nI know.\nI know.\nYeah, that's where those mainly fits in these up here.\nIt's four pay HDR and it's all that.\nSo it's like...\nYeah, I don't see where they invite your...\nWhat, buddy?\nNot mine.\nI'm not sure if I have it on my phone.\nI would need my own account, though.\nI just want to give you a movie, guys.\nWe're trying to do...\nWhat was your new campaign with?\nFor people who can't do...\nYeah, a campaign.\nThat's fucking local, though.\nI know, I know.\nYou should try not to worry about it.\nIt's so cool.\nBut, um...\nYou can control it.\nI don't need anything.\nShould we relaunch it?\nCome on, press it in.\nI'm trying to do it, so we're...\nDo we keep the deal more?\nHow do they do that now?\nWe used to do it too.\nTo say when, maybe, you know...\nYou know, they might be able to do it in a little bit of a second.\nWhat it used to be...\nIf I download a nice...\nNo, but...\nIt won't be online, but I bet.\nYou might be able to do two players, uh-huh.\nWhat if you turn a campaign and you can't do three months later?\nNo.\nStill, you should be able to do three months later.\nFour months later.\nYou make the game a little more social.\nI don't think you can do that unless everyone has their own account.\nWe're gonna bring this to you, too.\nLet me...\nYeah, if you had your viewers...\nI'm gonna show you more how, man.\nThat's a lot of fun, too.\nThis is running through the Xbox.\nNo, this is...\nThis is my PC.\nI know, but it connects into the Xbox.\nSo you can't play an Xbox and PC here, right?\nIf I'm using control...\nIf I'm using control...\nI have it on Xbox.\nI have a PC controller, I think.\nThat's not bad, dude.\nDid the Xbox have to play on it?\nI don't know, because I don't want to play a new video, you know what I mean?\nRight.\nVersus...\nReplay.\nWhat I'm saying to play is the other player.\nWhat pumpkin ball has to play, is probably.\nFor sure.\nI'm trying to block it, man.\nSearch for player by knee or tag to find somebody.\nThat's me.\nAre we able to stick with control over this door?\nNo, it all controls me, man.\nIt's so fucking fun.\nSo maybe you should walk with it if you're able to.\nThere should

actually a suit with veins in it.\nAnd these veins are designed to regulate temperature over the body.\nIt's like a, it's a beautiful little engineering device, it's like water being, it's like a,\nthis is a warm liquid because it causes the cold air to flow around and so on.\nWell, not to say a warm liquid actually just uses a human body, body regulation, human\ntemperature to regulate itself and use the water to move it around to average out and\nyou have like a means to exhaust the radiation by sway, way, way of steam.\nAnd it's just such as the same region of the human body is where you get a cut and all\nthe exhaust fluid.\nNo, no, it's like a, it's like a,\nGranted, the skin would be tough if it were.\nYeah, it could be like a tough clothing, but also, it also has to be like clothing.\nYeah, flexible, it can be too rigid, it has to be casual, it also has to be, it has to\nbe comfortable and active and cooling or regulating, I should say, although every tight\nclothing is really ready to go with that because you keep it tight to your skin, you know,\nit's more.\nSo, you just regulate with that kind of thing.\nI think the first thing that those kind of outfits is wrist, neck, and ankles placed.\nWhy not do an entire thing?\nI mean, no, I mean, no, like those points,\nI imagine like, I wish you with like a T-shirt, you know, but it's more regular, regular\ntoy.\nIt's like a body armor.\nIf they have it, it's going to be out for a quarter of a year.\nIs it going to leak, wrist?\nBecause the movement, your neck, things, your clothes, they're going to be torn around because\ndepending on how they're going to be.\nWell, they don't have to be, like a bulletproof vest, like, shape.\nWell, the suit can compensate for that.\nImagine it, okay, so you lose, you lose energy that way, right?\nIt's not a totally efficient system.\nImagine the suit could regulate, could, you're going to lose energy, no matter what\nsystem.\nYeah, I know exactly.\nYou got to put more, more engine into it.\nBut imagine if wireless charging by then and that's energy's on issue, you know, we're\ncharging these all the time, you know, there.\nAnd we're not paired with electricity.\nThere's a lot of pressure.\nThere's going to be a weak spot because as it's going to be used as a vaning spot,\ncorner is going to force us way in, as the hunter is leaving.\nOh.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nSo I guess it has to be tight then.\nIt has to be tight clothing.\nIt can't be loose at all.\nOtherwise, no, I mean, imagine if you had that tight, that tight layer beneath, imagine\nif you had like a new tank top, right, you have, you have underneath clothing, imagine\nyou have, you have, this suit is like the underneath clothing, right?\nAnd then you have these stylistic clothing above of that, you know, that way it's more\nof a, I mean, a means of comfort and also a trend, and you can have different colors\nand stuff.\nAnd it's like, yeah, that's, I mean, interesting.\nUm, jeez, what else?\nDo you see about that space gun?\nSpace gun.\nSo, when the back time New Jersey sent a mask about up, he made a gun that she's in space\nor they were just, we're fine, the model looked better.\nIt still looks like a tanky piece of shit, but if I was a pegged only, put it up, it's\na vacuuming gun.\nIt shoots a regular bullet.\nThe whole reaction takes place inside of it and then she's project that well.\nSo, like a, um, the connect missiles, but also a little more space like?\nWell, this is, it's a regular gun.\nBut it uses a function.\nYeah, but still not.\nNot just.\nIt uses the regular traditional reaction.\nYou're igniting, you're igniting, you're using oxygen.\nYeah, I'll say it had an oxygen, it's also on it.\nAnd here's, how do I tell you, I have, that's just going to, be using the ion engines,\none of the future missions, pretty soon.\nI'm finding these things, they don't blow up.\nWell, I don't think they blow up, but I think it's like, you're all you're doing is you're\ntaking energy, right?\nAnd you're using an ion's propulsion, you're using, you're converting the energy into thrust.\nIt's really cool.\nYeah, but, yeah, so those engines are really sensitive.\nThey're not fast, they're sensitive, they're precise.\nThey're like, good for satellites.\nIt's good for long travel.\nLong travel.

It's floating above the earth, right?\nAnd you see these representations of human communities.\nAnd you have these small tribes, little dots.\nIt's spread out, spread out, spread out, spread out.\nIt's bigger, bigger, bigger.\nAnd as they fall apart, they get further and further apart.\nThey get divided.\nBut then from inwards, from the areas they were developed the most.\nThey start developing closer and closer and closer and closer.\nAnd then they spread out even further.\nIt's an ongoing process of people, communities getting closer together.\nBut we're so early on in this process that it's hard to imagine a utopian future.\nWe will get there.\nIt's just a matter of time.\nDoes it make sense for you?\nDoes it make sense for you?\nI just, I don't like the idea of the utopia.\nOh God, that's...\nI may as a goal, but yeah, you're gonna get there.\nI don't think it works because that animal will be in the individual.\nBut if everyone, if the collective can make their individual individual bubble happiness,\nwe can meet those bubbles.\nAnd then there's no more understanding.\nYou have bubbles of inter-prosal connection.\nHuh?\nSo, three points or more.\n12 million people believe aliens brought us the moon.\nWhat do you think of those topics?\nThose misunderstandings will go away with time.\nBecause as science understands, it improves.\nRight now.\nNo, no, it's not.\nScience communication is getting better overall in the population.\nWe're pessimistic.\nWe love the news, love the media.\nThe loud majority is the loud majority.\nThe loud majority are never represented with the majority.\nThat is the size of cities.\nThe silent majority are silent.\nWe are the silent majority, though.\nI don't care about that.\nWhen I'm talking about it.\nIt's what we do.\nEveryone believes themselves to be good.\nNo one believes themselves to be evil.\nEvery human, the acting on their own.\nI'm not even talking about morality.\nI'm talking about what do you do with the people that don't want to aspire to this.\nBecause not everyone is going to get bomb.\nIt's a philosophy.\nIt's something that people don't want to do it.\nIt's a nevel philosophy.\nIt's a philosophy of understanding the connection.\nI don't want to do it.\nI don't know how it's 10 years.\nNo, no, no.\nWhat do you do with that?\nWhat do you do with that?\nWhat do you do with that?\nWhy would you not want to build better communities?\nWhy would you not want to build better social spaces?\nI don't know.\nPeople like that, though.\nWhat do you do with them?\nIt's the question.\nYou need to have a plan for what do you do with the people?\nBecause no matter how good it is, people are going to find the reason.\nOkay.\nI think you're going a little far in this.\n\n\n====== REC035.txt ======\nNo, you're right. You're absolutely right about that. But I think the point you're you're going around the wrong direction\nI don't think people are going to be outward and hate. They're going to be inward and fusion.\nNo, it's not even outward hate. It's they just don't want to do it.\nYou're aspiring to a motion to this. It's not about a motion. It's about some people don't want to be told what to do.\nAnd so they're going to react in a negative way even if it doesn't make sense. So it's what do you do with those people?\nWhat do you do with the people who have just decided or I don't want to follow this?\nWell, you isolated them too.\nNo, you don't isolate them. You keep them connected but at the same time you do rehabilitative retribution.\nSee, that just sounds like China now.\nNo, no, China.\nNot retribution, rehabilitation, just in and of itself. Rehabilitation.\nRehabilitation.\nRehabilitation. God, no.\nYou've got to give them their own. Send them all to Texas, dude.\nJust rehabilitate them. Let them and no one, no one, huh?\nBut how? It's been done in other countries.\nSo in small, I mean, not like large populations, but populations that are...\nI don't really do that without looking like a moral...\nThat's the problem is even though I don't know how true...\nYou guys, you got to reach free will. You got to reach free will by the same here as that is...\nI don't know who's playing this.\nThat's the thing. It's not everyone believes that. A large portion believes in free will.\nIt's like trying to teach a Christian to become an atheist.\nSo that's like going back to someone from the ages where we didn't have science holding up your phone\nand convincing them you didn't trap something. You're going to get burned at the stake.\nYou know how to convince him. You can show him all the fun things he does.\nBut at the end of the day, there's going to be one person out of however many there is.\nIt looks at that. You can see something.\nIt's not something you can program out because all it is is like you said,\nfeel it's fly or fight. And all it is is the flight experience.\nIt's kicking in, but they can't run.\nAnd they can't fight so they make these paranoid little circles.\nAnd that's how these confused you grew up.\nSo, Tristan, imagine this. I've tried it extensively before.\nBut imagine you have, I think I have.\nImagine you have these three symbols, right?\nAnd these three symbols are representative of a given individual's expression,\ninternally and externally.\nAnd you combine these symbols to make emotions, inward or outward emotions,\nthat we express or not express, that we keep internally and express externally.\nAnd these behaviors are deterministic.\nThey're perceivable. They're understandable.\nWe can break down the entirety of human interaction through a literal means\nusing a system of knowledge.\nFor example, aggression anxiety.\nWhat are aggression anxiety through attributed to?\nAggression is anger.\nAnxiety is fear.\nThat kind of thing.\nYou have, or at least, attributed to fear.\nI don't think anxiety is the perfect expression of that.\nThere are variables in language that are not fully explained.\nThey're not fully expressed.\nThey're not fully articulated.\nThey're not affords.\nThey're gradients from missing because of how confusing this is.\nSo there's an under-linear video that doesn't talk about this specifically,\nbut in it, to be in these things, they're entering the building, the garbage,\nbut the cylinder of the language, you should watch it.\nBecause the guy that's leading it,\ngoes early into depth about the formation of language,\nthe formation of the house, and sending structure.\nAnd he takes his sentence and he translates it into carbon\nusing these different variables that he built.\nSo it's like you're being a cultural anthropologist.\nYou're going cultural anthropologist and linguist.\nYeah, well, he's going to understand it.\nAnd he's developing a language for the quality of the campaign.\nAnd I'm not saying what's the whole series,\nbut that false video would help you out and understand the language.\nYeah, send me the link. That'd be good.\nOkay.\nBye.\n\n\n====== REC036.txt ======\nI don't know what English is, what is the D&D temper?\nYeah, I understand that.\nIt's free.\nI can list it at work because that's all I need.\nI didn't know.\nI can do that.\nI'll list it at work.\nDid you see the new Santa Flash that go?\nLet's ticklish.\nYeah, dude.\nThat's cool.\nThey're both synthetic flesh that they can use to graph onto a phone.\nThere's a joke right now.\nBut it responds to touch and it's ticklish.\nAnd it's completely synthetic.\nI made it in a lab putting that shit on it.\nIt's a synthetic wafer robot.\nYeah, I saw that it's a wafer kind of thing.\nI love it.\nIt reacts to tickles.\nThat's what it is.\nThat's what it is.\nThat's what it's going to be.\nSo I'm going to buy that.\nIt's really cool.\nCan you imagine when you get a new one?\nOh, my God.\nYou have the stimulation.\nYou can feel it.\nBecause that was the biggest issue for synthetic homes.\nThere's only the hand walks.\nBut even then, you don't get that situation.\nBut how do you connect that to nerves?\nWell, if they've lost their home,\nit's going to be a home mechanical unit.\nRight.\nBut how do you connect the mechanical unit to individual nerves?\nThat's how we can show this.\nWe connect it to the nose.\nReally, we can do that now.\nI thought it was a muscle.\nHe has both his arms and both his legs.\nAnd he just uses the whole system.\nAnd he thinks that the hand does it for you.\nI thought the thinking was the muscles.\nIt wasn't actually the movement of the arm.\nIt wasn't direct movement.\nHe doesn't move his arm actually.\nHe thinks they're moving his arm and the thought.\nBut it's not as direct.\nIt's not as quick.\nNo, it's still working out there.\nBut they've got it to the point now.\nYeah, instead of having him to actually physically move.\nMaybe it's more of a...\nMaybe he needs to go through more intensive physical therapy.\nIt's like his 70s response time.\nThis is an old dude.\nSo, in his 70s, he's a quadru...\nHe's also always lived.\nAnd this is the fourth time he's been able to do anything.\nHe agreed to sign up for it because he had no limbs.\nHe couldn't touch a walk.\nAnd now he can actually really mentally.\nBut he can turn doors.\nHe can pick up A and B.\nSo, as crazy as sounds, do you think someone would be...\nOh, no, people would think.\nI don't know.

So it's like you actually have\nMore control over it. Well, no, so the heavy hand axe\nYou know when you could flip it and it's on so the hammer\nYou can now repair stuff with it. Are you couldn't before? No, you couldn't use it to repair. What the fuck?\nYeah, I wanted to destroy you wait. Yeah, so now you say you something's built and it's damaging and you have that heavy hand axe\nYou can switch for the hammer to repair it\nOh, I never knew it was the mall because I was your lawyer\nSo I'm gonna explain this game to you real quick if I can\nSo more how it is this\nHacken slash brawler, right?

Yeah, chivalry, right?\nIt's uh, but I think it's closer in terms of for honor actually\nI think it's for chivalry falls away from that the less competitive and more goofy. It's not as realistic\nI think that this game is a does a better job of trying to\nYeah, they they've but they have this in the directional attacks right as you remember in chivalry\num\nBut then they have the movements is\nIt's less bizarre and such radical in chivalry like you can't you can't if you move like before really for our back\nUh, it'll fuck your attack\nBut if you if there are some people to do this bullshit where you like you look up\nYou attack you look down you attack and it's like that throws me off, but I think they they got a balance better\nAnyway, um\nThe uh attack directions and you're you're chambering you're more free and you're throwing your storage into like\nLike a lightsaber you go back and forth. You're you're kicking you're grabbing you're not grabbing you know\nYeah, he just you just uh\nHey\nWhen they run into kick I'll just swing up and it just catches you in the bottom of the job. Yeah, because I think open is still in down so they block up\nCrunch\nThat is satisfied the giving and the crunching. Yeah, um, I like it's the bastards were personally\nSo I like like I like you this you this thing called chambering you're in I'm not sure if that's sort of children I haven't played it, but um\nUh, you have you have the you're showing your sword right and then as the opponent\nShe's the incoming swing they can chamber they can attack into it like\nSure attack again, and like\nYou're dragging your sword across the screen and trying to fight for control on them. You know, it's like um\nSwinging the sword in a in VR maybe that'd be fun. What are you doing?\nWhen we're life\nBut then you have kicks and you can throw dirt and no, no, you can't throw dirt\nYou can throw smoke and you throw fire fire bombs and and axes and rocks and rocks and\nSpears I love getting spirit like when you when you get stabbed your character the spear or arrow.

He's this guy is making these videos, right?\nUh, he's\nGot an audience he has a patreon and he responds to requests of the questions on patreon\nYeah, so I'm gonna ask him can I is it could I put these videos?\nIn my game like a YouTube video like a link like by watching and he can get ad revenue\nBut players imagine players in the game can explore they can see these videos they can watch videos\nBecause they're related to the world right in some way\nWhat if it took way ads what if it was just to watch them to your leisure to your interest\nAnd it links to a patreon\nI mean like you have a video\nAs in like I get permission from him to\nInclude links visible links watchable links inside the world of the game\nSo you want a couple of that\nBecause it just breaks the narrative for you\nYou're right\nUnless you put in the context of like this is archival data\nWe're watching it\nYeah, but even then you have to be very careful\nWell, I'm selective about which which which ones you're available\nLike the ones that are relevant to the world\nSo within that kill science fiction is your heart\nAnd then I kill science fiction is your heart\nRight\nYeah\nBut it's all to fantasize when something's being explained\nHow are you right?\nSo if you go and you explain the science behind some of this\nIt takes away some of the mystery\nAnd you have a couple because you want to have some mystery for that game\nBut okay, so I he asked you wrote another artist using good enough make are doing science fiction\nYeah, not in the game\nBut or I can talk to him about like maybe you can bring me the game itself\nLet me infuse you\nYeah, sure, that works too\nI don't know how much he would like that\nI don't know how much he requests that\nJust ask it\nWell, it doesn't like he's good intention\nAnd I feel like if he has things that he wants the world to see like good science fiction\nHe wants to run it\nSo what if I could run the game?\nThat's the thing is everything subjective is there\nYeah, but I've seen it here before\nSo there's one at the same time that he won't do it\nI'm just saying what you think is a good concept he might be less likely\nSo I've been able to make the concept widely appealing\nAnd if the concept was right\nIf I could produce a demo\nMake a demonstration of the game\nA little bit of a slice I think he might be willing\nBut you're right, it's going to take some consideration\nThere's still a lot of green in there\nThere's still a lot of green in there\nAnd there's still a lot of green in there\nAnd there's still a lot of green in there\nAnd there's still a lot of green in there\nAnd there's still a lot of green in there\nAnd there's still a lot of green in there\nAnd there's still a lot of green in there\nAnd there's still a lot of green in there\nAnd there's still a lot of green in there\nAnd there's still a lot of green in there\nAnd there's still a lot of green in there\nSo you're going to do just about side\nWhat I'm going to do is just about side\nI'm going to do just about side\nI'm going to do just about side\nYou're just going to do just about side\nThat's kind of nice doing it\nIt's kind of nice\nThat's the one\nI'm so full, but at this time, that's good.\nIt saves you money, haven't we spent like 45 seconds on this, like, too much?\nJust a week or a little?\nI'll just have this one dry.\n30 bucks?\nHow old are you?\n30 or 20 bucks?\nHow old are you?\n30 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 if you have dunno,\n10 or 40?\n40 or 40?\n40 or 30?\nAnd this man said that he's was joining us to get to Stockholm.\nSo, then what do you have for大家 in endless congregation?\nYou left for Stockholm\nand then you went with them as a decorate\nand quickly moved them down.\nto answer a couple of answers we get rolling. We do have an extra episode coming out this week on\nNebula. That's where we will see you after the ray of intelligence episode which is coming out.\nIt's like ray of technology. That's coming out this Thursday at the airport time.\nWe have a poll button right now for what episodes we're going to be doing.\nIt was a check-in.\nYeah, that would be good.\nI do.\nSo we're going to start with questions.\nI don't know how it would happen.\nI don't know how it would happen.\nI have a lot of problems so sure.\nI'm going to follow my deck and we're going to get absolutely disappointed.\nYeah, I'm sorry. I'm not going to do that.\nIt's a check-in yet.\nIt was made to leave a hundred pounds.\nI can bring my yeast on and just wrap myself in it.\nIf you move to telecast from the loop, you can do that with a push along, you know, new inertia into it.\nSo, for instance, if I was Liddy, my feet was on the moon, sometimes cannibalized, sometimes parkwise,\nbut it's all fun, you know.\nThese guys actually got less mass eye.\nJust like the men.\nWell, not just the communities actually don't work out.\nYou need to have a lot more information.\nBut I think I cannot.\nYou can always set up a

little bit of justice?\nHe's on Mads Books.\nYeah, that's crazy.\nOkay.\nSo, you got a humble.\nHe's very technical.\nVery mathematical.\nHow do you spend that book?\nSo, just a guy.\nOne of them has clear simulations.\nHe might have had to do that this way.\nI'm not saying it's not.\nHe doesn't read those books.\nI might have read a lot about it.\nYou're talking about it.\nYou're talking about it.\nYou're talking about it.\nYou're talking about it.\nThis might just be something you know.\nfit.\nHe set up some of his kind of things that he can give.\nBut I'm sorry, for fairly Mario.\nI'm actually the one that hasn't had the light on him yet.\nYeah.\nIs there an owner who is showing some extra pieces.\nNo one knows that wasn't the guy.\nI'm not fully sure they're wearing the Philanthropy.\nYeah.\nTrue.\nThat disco here is just what you do in a scene.\nThat disco was about what you want.\nPeople who have singing on that story,\nYou can get my socks, but for some reason, if

sound and the snow and your vessels.\nThe normal thing.\nWe also grill a rock.\nBecause, of course, it's a...\nThese are all actually fairly common sounds with only a few attention.\nSo, we also have, in all the same points of articulation,\nwe have a fricative series.\nSo, we have fa, sa, sha, ha, ha, ha, and ha.\nWe also have a lateral fricative because I'm an asshole.\nThere's always got to be something.\nYup, that's not.\nAnd we also have a large...\nThese are types of cons.\nAnd, as far as I'm concerned, you can do a lighter dark out.\nIt's a consonants.\nSo, those are the boring sets of the consonants.\nBut then, the sounds are really interesting.\nSo, we don't have any voices going into this section.\nSo, B and B are the same sound.\nBut, all the stops can be...\nUnasparated, aspirated, or fringilized.\nAnd so, that's where we're going to start getting into some of the more interesting things\nthat we're doing right at the outset.\nWhich is to say that there's already built into this a nice potentials or some aliphami.\nSo, all of these stops are going to be voiced...\nWell, sorry, all the simple stops are going to be voiced between vowels.\nAnd, the fringilized stops, as well as the fringial and glottal concepts,\nare actually going to slightly front fat vowels.\nSo, that's rather than being odd.\nAfter, say, a fringilized P.\nSo, odd will be pat.\nYeah.\nSo, we've got a little ass out in there.\nThe thing is, at this stage,\nthose speaker of a language would differentiate between those sounds.\nRight.\nSo, like, technically in English,\nthe P at the beginning and end of the word pop\naren't actually pronouncing the same.\nYou probably don't hear it in English,\nwe don't care about that distinction.\nSo, the first thing we're going to do is\nwe're going to come up with a nice pronoun.\nSo, right now, I want a nice syllable vowel structure.\nFirst one pronoun, second.\nOh, I should probably have one in there as it is.\nFirst, second, third.\nAnd, actually, I'm going to open it up.\nIt sure is pretty good.\nSo, is that her interlocutor?\nSo, it'll be up here.\nSo, that way it's easy to see.\nAll right.\nSo, syllable vowel.\nWe're sorry, consonant vowel.\nWhat do you got, Shesh?\nWhat do you think?\nIs this really hard to read?\nOh, isn't it?\nLet me make it clear.\nI think it really isn't clear.\nYeah, there we go.\nSo, we want a consonant vowel.\nAnd it can be more than one syllable,\nalthough pronouns tend to be fairly simple.\nDo we want an open mouth or do we want open mid?\nI'm sorry.\nI'm just thinking about how we're going to pronounce the vowel.\nOh, so, these...\nWho was rounded?\nYou know, it's closed and unrounded.\nIt's also unrounded.\nAnd we don't want to make it too complicated by starting off with vowels, right?\nWe want to start a consonant vowel.\nYeah, so, right now, I want this...\nWe're going to stick with the pronoun problem.\nThe syllable structure is going to be very simple.\nEvery syllable is just a consonant followed by a vowel.\nBut, we're going to make it much more complicated later.\nOkay, so, why don't we do a nasal, an open mid, and then...\nWhat?\nWell, we only have an open back vowel.\nWhat we could do...\nHow are some of these examples?\nWhat's up?\nHow are some of these examples?\nThat's what they're trying to come up with now.\nOkay.\nOh, they're coming up in language.\nThey're making a language.\nYeah.\nOh, my God.\nSo, we'll build a little consonant vowel system right now.\nJust one.\nOkay.\nWe can end this.\nWe can end this.\nWe can end this.\nYeah.\nBecause they already stored the...\nNothing.\nSo, she's coming up with the idea that some of these explain the system.\nYou're going to learn, like, so would that be me?\nIt's kind of

the...\nThe limitations of the consonant and the steps that are in the system.\nSo, do you want to put a language?\nYou probably want a different story.\nYeah, that's nice.\nI think...\nNo, I think we should use English.\nBecause that's the meaning of the carcible.\nI'm going to really really want to.\nI reckon we're going to use English because I don't know about language.\nOkay, enough for enough.\nAnd I think I'm going to use those...\nThose beeps and whistles.\nWell, because we...\nYou know, those are fairly complex.\nI could say I need to exaggerate here.\nBecause it's...\nI could use the beeps and whistles as an abstraction.\nWell, I could actually do it.\nDepending on how big the scope is.\nI could...\nI could...\nI could use...\nThe beeps and whistles as an

like the actual thing.\nRight, but then...\nYou have the...\nThe linguist aspect of it.\nSo you're building it, right?\nBut then you have the culture and the polygist aspect of\nparsing language, how

about 10 and a 700, but I said we can put them in a few.\nYeah, so it's 20 billion people, but it's not crowded.\nIt's just a pessimist.\nI don't know if I suppose we lost people.\nKey.\nI mean, I think you break things too much down the pessimist if you're optimistic.\nNo, I mean, I think that typically people imagine that overpopulation leads to overcrowding,\nbut it doesn't necessarily.\nWe're going to hit the cap, we're going to hit the peak.\nAnd then, I mean, people more people will be born.\nThe population will steadily rise, but it's not going to rise as sharply as people believe.\nAnd in that rise, we can build more.\nI mean, like building.\nWe like expressing ourselves through architecture.\nSo, building will persist.\nYou will build populations slowly over time, but it's not going to be out of control.\nIt will be totally fine.\nBecause these spaces are going to socialize, but there's the space above it.\nSo, there's the community space, but then there's a lot of them.\nI wouldn't say a disk, but a larger surface area they work with for the either warehouses and stuff,\nall the manufacturing, the big stuff.\nAnd then the stuff above that, that's, and it's all automated, right?\nAnd the stuff above that, that's where scientists gather, that's where people gather.\nI mean, they're in both sections, but this is where they gather the big projects.\nImagine you're at the top of the Alice Village.\nYou have a almost like a curved disk that is to the curvature of the planet, right?\nIt comes over like a, oh, it's an attack.\nThis top piece is an attachment point for the sphere that encapsulates the planet.\nBut it's not attached to the top, it's attached to the sides.\nThey launch rockets and they're in stuff.\nBecause they don't know what the moon does.\nThe moon that is of less mass than their planet.\nNo, I'm more mass.\nIt has to be more mass, otherwise you're not going to have a fellowship.\nThe planet ship.\nSo it is, this planet is a moon.\nThe people, the one that, technically, they live on as a moon to this orbiting body that's unknown to them.\nBut there's a layer like, imagine like a sphere, right?\nYou have this, you have the external surface when you have interior.\nWhat if the interior is pulled back a little bit like you're intruding it?\nNo, extruding it.\nExtruding it in words.\nAnd you have this layer like a crust, right?\nBut the crust is made up of energy.\nMany of all the resources.\nImagine this thing being a little,\ngeez, six times.\nI don't know how much, 32 times the size of the planet?\nSo that's something you're not going to get out of the scale.\nThe scale, yeah, the scale for weight or density to mass ratio.\nLike, what is, for moving the planet from the point they're at to the center,\nto have it be completely lit.\nCentrope the galaxy.\nDid I, did I not explain that?\nNo, I mean like, you don't need it to be literate on that port.\nNo, I do want to keep it scientific, or literate.\nI don't, okay, so the sun, right?\nBut the amount of energy we need to move to planet, that ain't shit.\nCompared to the amount of sun, amount of energy the sun can go off.\nSo you gather using a Dyson swarm.\nYou gather energy and you store it into the sphere.\nImagine there being amount of starscape in the sky,\nbut in an array, like a swarm or a cluster,\na group of these, these, these, these godex that have been released by the sun,\nreleased by the orbiting Dyson swarm.\nThey are the densest possible energy source,\nthat humans could ever conceivably be creating without creating a black hole.\nYeah.\nThey're stable.\nThey don't, they don't explode in the black holes.\nThey're, maybe it's a threshold for defense,\nthreshold for protection, like batteries, you know.\nThey're not built to explode, they're not built to be optimal for energy storage,\nbecause energy dissipates, right?\nIt heat loss through the movement.\nSo what if you convert all the energy you've got in the sun into solid structures,\ninto ecos empty square?\nYou need, it's cost energy to do this,\nbut the cost to save is more worth it than losing energy,\nall the energy all together.\nYou're spending energy from the sun to build these things,\npermanently encapsulated energy, permanently,\nyou are preparing for the infinite,\npreparing for the everlasting universe,\nthrough our imagination anyway.\nBecause if you gather all the energy in the galaxy,\nall the energy in the galaxy of our neighboring star,\nwe could live for a similar infinite amount of time.\nSo,\nwe could live for a similar infinite amount of time.\nWe could live for a similar infinite amount of time.\nWe could live for a similar infinite amount of time.\nWe could live for a

So-\nNo, no, no.

from each other.\nImagine-\nIs there truly an engine?\nIf there's an engine, is there something else?\nWhat?\nImagine-\nOkay, imagine-\nImagine if it's expanding faster.\nImagine the universe has to expand.\nEventually, the galaxies-\nI know it expands.\nBut imagine like a bubble.\nAnd when these galaxies reach the edge of the bubble, that's where they stop.\nThat's very unreadable.\nThat's where they all gather.\nI mean, it'd be nice if there was, but I guess that's-\nThat's the most diverse thing that's-\nWell, we've figured out that all the signs on us, we used-\nWe used that the universe expanding at a solid rate.\nOkay, so how do-\nLet's pick it down.\nLet's pick it down for myself, I guess.\nWhat are you trying to break down?\nWhat are you-\nHow do we know-\nHow do we know-\nWhat is-\nI want to know the theory behind it.\nI want to know if the process of which people have to do is set this thing up.\nWhat do you mean, that's-\nThat's where you want to expand it?\nYes.\nSo we've understood the process and then asked what questions.\nWe-\nWe use the very many ways we can make the way to each other.\nSo the distance between stars, we're measuring the distance that keeps getting larger and larger.\nStars and galaxies, you know, the quasars and-\nWe use one of them from now.\nSo what we did is we figured out-\nWe analyzed how much distance we gained from us in the moon.\nWe did that to come up with a basic speed limit, which is pretty much skill-like.\nUsing that as a basis, we ran-\nFrom no distance from us to the next nearest body.\nWe then waited and re-shot that result, calculated that result and-\nWe plugged it in and we developed what we-\nWe intended we consider this speed limit.\nOkay, and then we found out it is-\nSpeed limits were actually expanding as fast as-\nSomething we're not- something we're not considering.\nSomething we're not considering in this whole aspect.\nSo imagine-\nYou got-\nNo, hang on, hang on.\nWhat?\nIf you pop up

moving through space.\nOur planet is not-\nI'm not still settling.\nNo, it's moving through space.\nAt the same time, the galaxy, the galaxy is moving through space too.\nYeah.\nImagine if all these

universe.\nMoving us, we've only been destroyed by-\nAnd that's there.\nThere is say-\nIt's just a black hole.\nWe're-\nWe are beyond the threshold.\nI can affect us.\nIt's so far away.\nHere's my hypothesis.\nBecause-\nRemember that the-\nThe-\nThe black hole we have in the center of our galaxy, right?\nIt's-\nWell, it's not-\nIt's not the galaxy.\nHmm?\nIt's not in the center of our galaxy.\nNo, no, not this one.\nThe-\nThe smaller one.\nThe smaller one is in the center of our galaxy.\nWe know that for sure.\nWe go to other galaxy to observe that-\nThere are-\nThey have a super mega black hole.\nSuper mega-\nSuper massive black hole in the center of the galaxy.\nAnd then-\nBecause it's so far away.\nBecause it's at the black hole.\nWe-\nWe can-\nIn-\nIn the range of our-\nOf our-\nOf our-\nOf our perception, we can understand the gravitational pull.\nWe can make sense of it.\nThere's mathematics that prove it.\nAnd I think you could prove it if we went away from the-\nOkay, we're not at the center of the galaxy.\nWe're not-\nWe're not-\nI know we're not, but I think we misunderstand.\nWe're-\nWe're not-\nSeeing enough time past-\nTo fully grasp the idea that there is a super mega-\nSuper mega intergalactic black-\nBlack hole.\nIn the center of our universe.\nSo these are the thing about black holes.\nThey give out energy every once in a while.\nBut if it's so far away.\nIf you were to register it.\nWe have this radiation everywhere.\nAnd this is a very big spike.\nSo the spike of radiation that they give off.\nTypically, we do the amount of energy that they pull away.\nWell, how far away would we be?\nWell, we're not affected by radiation in the center.\nThey multiply as I know that.\nBut we put this in perspective.\nWe can detect this in small black holes.\nSo what you're saying is happening.\nWe've already experienced the pulse right now.\nHow frequent are the pulses?\nRelated to the mass.\nIt depends on the black hole.\nWhat you're saying is, we've already seen some kind of a knowledge\nthat proves it exists.\nWell, we're wanting persisted for just years,\njust years as a growing species.\nWhat are you talking about?\n12,000 years.\nIt's really massive.\nOne more.\nIt's almost good.\nI don't think you understand anything.\nYou're talking about a black hole that is large enough to encapsulate the Intel Universe.\nIt was large enough.\nJust like ours.\nIt was large enough.\nOr it could potentially be large enough.\nBut I don't think it will be.\nBecause it's always...\nImagine, okay.\nSo let's say that there is an antibody death in the Universe.\nWe will get there.\nWell, yeah.\nIt's talking radiation.\nIt's a thing.\nWe're going to either get too far away to heat up.\nWe're going to get too far away to heat up.\nBut again, if this is...\nIf we're orbiting around a super mega intergalactic black hole\nat the center of the Universe,\nthat means we won't get farther away.\nWe're just moving temporarily away from all these other planets.\nBecause we want to observe for so long.\nWe're moving away from other planets.\nThey're not all of them.\nSome of them are moving closer to us.\nYeah, again.\nThey're rotating.\nThey're coming closer and farther away.\nBut how do you know that they're rotating?\nThey're moving away from us.\nIt's moving away from us.\nWe need to observe longer.\nWe want to see a small fraction of time.\nWe want to watch them move a little bit.\nRelative to our location in the Universe.\nIt's like the vision...\nRemember, let's never stand.\nRemember, when we look to the stars,\nwe're looking into the past.\nYeah.\nSo we're watching it move.\nBut it's so slow that we want to proceed for so long\nthat we haven't seen the full procession of the Universe.\nI think you just have an instant understanding of the science behind it.\nSo you're claiming that we're moving in a vertical pattern.\nWe're left to right.\nWe're right to left.\nWe're orbiting in any direction.\nIn like a traditional system.\nIt's like an atom.\nWe're orbiting a black hole that will be pulled in eventually.\nWe're going to want to see it right now.\nIf you're close enough, you could pull that.\nNo, so here's a way you would see eventually\nthat something is being pulled that direction.\nSo imagine this.\nHave you seen the visual for black holes?\nImagine a top surface, right?\nTop surface.\nYou have the center.\nNo, I think the tension is.\nYou'll pull the stuff in no matter how big it is it's pulling stuff in\nand it doesn't matter how far away it is.\nWe would see evidence of that pool on something.\nIt wouldn't just be...\nIt just stops.\nWhat if it's hard to see the pool if you're only experiencing a small section of space?\nIt would still be noticeable.\nIf we can notice the pool off of these small ones, we would definitely notice.\nWhat if that's...\nWhat if we misunderstand?\nOkay.\nSo we can order into it.\nWhat if we're saying dark energy and dark mass is not a thing?\nWe can only absorb and penetrate these from now on with smaller black holes.\nSo we already know what we're looking at.\nWhat?\nWe already know what we're looking for.\nWe've already seen this happen with smaller black holes.\nSo what you're saying, we would see some kind of phenomena of its existence.\nBecause we know how black hole functions.\nWe've seen what happens when it pulls things in.\nWe've seen the effect that it has on follow bodies.\nRight, but can we observe the effects of other bodies on a structure that big?\nIt would be very noticeable.\nYou would have whole galaxies tilting.\nLet me try to...\nOkay, it's like...\nIf you live back in the day.\nAnd you're looking at the sky and you're watching a move.\nBut you're so far away that...\nYou're just not grasping it.\nWe've seen how...\nSo this is a good way to look at it is...\nThough I have to look down on the air.\nWe see the adult moving in the air.\nAnd you have what you're describing.\nYou would see it moving in a general direction.\nBecause right now we're expanding in every direction.\nIf what you were proposing is true, we would be expanding in only so many directions.\nIt would be a direction of pool.\nIt doesn't matter how massive it is, you would see a pool on it.\nHow do you see a pool if we don't know the direction it's moving?\nI mean, we've seen a procession of nearby galaxies.\nIt doesn't have light.\nLiterally, it pulls everything.\nNothing escapes the black hole.\nYou would see a pattern of phenomena or it doesn't feel right.\nIt would be like having six flashlights finding one direction and one side shining slightly off.\nIt's still buried on the yellows, but those are distinct change.\nBecause it won't be uniform with the rest of the uniforms.\nThere would be a spot on the uniforms where there is something different.\nWhy does that be different?\nBecause you're being pulled into the black hole.\nThe black hole is impassive.\nHow do we experience a difference if this is only a perspective we had?\nWe haven't had a chance to analyze the gravitational pull of other galaxies.\nWe can predict them.\nWe can predict them.\nWe can mathematically predict them.\nWe can't measure the galaxy.\nMeasure the gravitational pull.\nWe can look at a matter of this.\nSo you see this, right?\nThis basic visual, right?\nYeah, you saw this already before.\nSo imagine you're having a black hole in the order here.\nYeah.\nBut this is actually not accurate to the flash space hash.\nBut why is it an accurate?\nWe have a graduate.\nOkay.\nSo it is accurate to read.\nIt's halfway there.\nYou have the right pull.\nThis is the right visual for it.\nBut it's not pulled to the downside.\nIt's pulled to the middle.\nIt's like a...\nOkay, so...\nThe space is 2D, right?\nThe space is on this side.\nIt's like...\nSo here's the thing.\nYou can't have a black hole in something above them below it.\nThat's not how that works.\nIf you have a black hole, it is...\nThat's for the board.\nThat's for the viscous.\nIt's like...\nA black hole pulls from every side.\nThere's not like it only pulls from one side like this.\nRight, right.\nIt does pull from every side.\nBut this is the middle.\nImagine like...\nYou throw a...\nYou throw a...\nYou throw a...\nYou throw a...\nYou throw a floating object into water.\nImagine like you're throwing...\nYou throw a bottle cap on the water.\nIt floats.\nIf you get a...\nA black hole, it literally strips and stretches metal.\nYou don't float.\nYou don't float.\nIt's pulling all directions, right?\nImagine it pulling towards the center.\nIt stretches immediately.\nSo as soon as you hit, you are immediately just throwing a ball.\nImagine you throw a ball...\nA rubber ball in the water.\nI think it's...\nIt floats itself.\nIt's not water.\nYou're right.\nIt's not water.\nBut imagine the ball...\nSomehow, use your gravity.\nIt pulls its...\nPulls towards the center of the water.\nThe center surface.\nThe center surface.\nThere's a spot on the black hole.\nThe center...\nI know, I know, there's not.\nI mean, there is the middle.\nThere's the center mass.\nThis is pulling her direction.\nBut it's pulling towards the center of that space.\nIt's not like this.\nIt's more like it's raised a little bit.\nIt's in the center at this...\nWhat you're proposing is...\nIf you have a black hole...\nImagine multiple black holes in the surface.\nImagine there's a bunch of them, right?\nAnd then you have the one mega, mega super one in the middle.\nYou have...\nOkay.\nYou wouldn't have anything left around if you'd be pulling everything in.\nOur galaxy...\nOur super mega black hole, doesn't it?\nIt's just a matter of distance.\nIt's a matter of scale.\nThis thing is so far away, it's hard to imagine.\nBut...\nOkay.\nI don't leave it there.\nLet's place more.\nNow, I think you're just overstretching again.\nAlright.\nThat's fine.\nIt's your step off as this.\nSo...\nSo, like, if you had a black hole that heaps,\nwe would see a phenomenon from it.\nThere would be traces of it.\nIt's just like how we can detect the small ones.\nWe can detect them.\nBecause those fine traces that they do.\nBut it's like...\nOkay, it's like...\nWe can't experience evolution of left time in the scale that we imagine.\nAnd that we understand.\nRight?\nThat...\nThere would be no exists.\nBecause...\nIt's too late over time scale.\nYeah.\nSo it's like...\nThe time scale is difficult to comprehend.\nIt's difficult for us to...\nNo, but the thing is we'd have a trace.\nNo matter how big there'd be some kind of trace.\nSo we'd have to find...\nI'd have to find a trace to verify in this.\nWe'd have to find a mathematical principle that...\n...articulates that this thing exists.\nI think...\nSo, you're big as...\nA theory of everything.\nWe won't have that yet.\nNo, it's not...\nYou don't mean everything.\nYou just need a way to explain how you're going to hype up through this realistic.\nWell, it's not...\nOkay, well...\nSo, it's not...\nThis is a black hole, right?\nIt's not multiverse.\nIt's not...\nWhat do you call it?\nIt's not...\nIt's not...\nYou have a black hole, right?\nThis is the explanation on the grid stuff.\nOkay.\nNo matter how far away you get...\n...there is going to be...\n...a visible thing.\nBecause if these ones that are like...\n...maybe the size of this spec...\n...if we were able to detect...\n...we would be able to detect this.\nBecause the signs this...\nIs there a hypothetical...\nIt's so easy to see.\nIs there a hypothetical condition to which...\n...a black hole could not be felt easily?\nNo, it's that size.\nBecause one of that size...\n...you would have a whole...\nIt's about...\nIt's not a size about density.\nAnd what if this thing is so dense that...\n...it's zero?\nThat's not...\nSo...\nYou keep acting like it's not going to be pulling things in.\nSomething this big would literally have a blank spot in the universe.\nWe can only say so far.\nOur light can only travel so far.\nNo, but it pulls in light.\nYou would see what those...\nA spot with no light.\nIt's a good perspective, okay?\nLike, not even light.\nYou would have a giant, massive spot of emptiness.\nWhat if this universe has...\nWhat if light has reached us yet?\nWhat if this thing is so far away?\nNo.\nBecause if you don't...\nIf you travel so far, it's not light.\nIf the universe can eventually...\nIf it can farther and farther.\nImagine...\nImagine dark matter.\nTraveling upwards.\nExplore.\nThis structure.\nWhat do you call it?\nNo, so it's not about light.\nNot reaching it.\nNo matter where it is, it's going to be stolen by.\nNo matter where it is, we're going to see a spot of light.\nNo, I mean, it sucked it in and took in light already.\nImagine that it does light.\nYou'd be said it only goes so full.\nSo there's going to be stuff that's on that boundary edge.\nWhat if we start seeing about your edge in like a hundred thousand years?\nTen thousand years?\nWe'll be seeing it, though.\nAs massive as you were talking about, we would have seen it already.\nWhat if it hasn't started?\nWhat if, because it's so far away, we haven't seen the light yet.\nAnd the light would reveal that it is, in fact.\nIt would be already visible.\nIt's like how we can look at a story.\nBut again, time scale.\nIt's like...\nAll right, I find it a better way to argue with this thing.\nThat's not good enough.\nBecause right now, what you're talking about is it moving on a separate time scale.\nAnd right now, we only have one time scale we're done done.\nYou need to have...\nYou need to have a longer first perspective in human time.\nNo, not a longer perspective, but you need to have a way to show this other time scale.\nI know what you're trying to get at.\nWe're trying to argue that we just haven't experienced enough time to experience one of these phenomena.\nWhat I'm all hearing is, that might be true, but no matter how long it's been,\nthere will be signs of trace.\nEverything lives in trace somewhere.\nBut black holes gather all the traces up and gobble them up there.\nYeah, but we would see that devastation illustrated.\nWe might see the light, but we couldn't, because it's not there yet.\nTo our background now.\nYou keep getting fixated on that.\nOkay.\nSo there's light around it.\nThe radiation, right?\nThe chocolate radiation talked about this disease.\nWell, we'd see this.\nA radiation who's slower than light, doesn't it?\nOh, sorry, this is worse.\nNo, so what I'm trying to explain is...\nThere's always going to be a trace somewhere, huh?\nYeah, I'll walk if you don't.\nI didn't get to pizza.\nThere's always going to be...\nYou can't move through...\nI'm thinking about how we're going to be able to track the video of the whole galaxy to what it was sort of.\nWe're going to have to track the whole time, because it seems like we're

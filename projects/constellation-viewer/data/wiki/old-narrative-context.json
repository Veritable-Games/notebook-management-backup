He guided them and stayed behind on the wreckage of the rotating habitat. He controls the body of the renlei droid in the Menesk squad. He's been keeping the ACP grounded all this time? why? why haven't the Menesk abandoned the planet after being attacked? why did the ACP colonize the planet after seeing the ring?\n\nGoal for WF colonists. colonize the galaxy, preserve planets with signs of life, study those of interest, build dyson swarms around every star in the galaxy, extend the life of every star by star lifting and store all the energy they collect into Enul spheres, then transport them to the center of the galaxy.\n\nACP were a generational ship colony. diverged so far from earth's humanity, their ideals and cultures clashed with them WF colonists. most colony ships at the time stayed in touch with earth and maintained their original languages and upgraded their technology as new developments were made on earth. here, the ACP are so concerned with just surviving, few advancements were made in their time spent on the planet. this colony was lost when they split from their fleet. how did the ACP occupy the planet if it was already encapsulated?\n\nAEI has been observing ACP for generations. He attempted to neutralize their droid armies, but they responded by removing their networked capabilities. why were nanites ineffective?\nculture of preservation. ring worlds can explore encapsulated planets via remote control human-like drones that have action restrictions to prevent damage or contamination to existing ecosystems. humans are free to explore lifeless planets by themselves or terraform previously lifeless planetary bodies.\n\npotential reasons for ACP fighting WSC\n\tthe ACP in power sought to maintain it. unlimited energy and resources undermine them.\n\tfear of an AI. original colonists fought to get their AEI back from the ACP. someone died in the process and the AEI is now hesitant to help due to the fear of another loss\n\trenlei attacked the colonists because they wanted to claim the world for their own and felt justified in taking it after traveling for so long. they succeeded, but weren't able to learn anything about their newly developed technologies before wiping them out (or so they thought)\n\tACP attack the Menesk because they've tapped into the geothermal power supply and they've been mining fuel from untapped areas on the planet's surface to warm it up. (but they see this as theft)\n\tetc.\n\tACP can't escape planet's atmosphere because of Kessler syndrome. Debris orbiting Earth with such density that it can't be passed. How do the Menesk land? Electromagnetic shielding.\n\nInstill a sense of mystery like the studio Ghibli films. only reveal information about the world as the characters need it. must be relevant to their journey. study those films \n\nonly preserve a planet when life is found there or the potential for life is strong. what did they find?\n\nforget Svalbard. rework story to explain why these factions are on an extra-solar planet. \n\nshow don't tell. don't have dialogue heavy intro. any information about the world should be situationally relevant. give players information when characters need it. avoid hyper explanation. mystery is important in engaging players and most people don't care about long-detailed stories. keep the 'immediate' plot simple. focus on character-related stories to present a bigger universe. \n\nMenesk are still derived from Svalbard or other Nordic countries. note the names and cultural inclinations. the earth they left behind has recovered from whatever catastrophe they faced. the renlei are the remnants of a long-dissolved faction. (kind of like if the Soviet Union had persisted long after the Cold War)\n\nplanet has oxygen, but humans are the only form of life present. they quickly find out that the frozen oceans are thawing in certain areas, and that the oxygen producing alga is spreading all over the planet. the Menesk characters discover artificially created fauna species in isolated, self-sustaining green-houses. they're slowly pulling carbon dioxide in from the atmosphere and converting it into oxygen. \n\ncolonists arrive by wafer sat. their civilization has a huge head start over the ACPs generational ships and a significant time advantage over the Menesk, even though these colonists launched last. they had almost completed the ring by the time the ACP arrived and halted their progress. the ACP crash landed on the planet and haven't been able to attack the artificial habitat due to the loss of the few aerospace engineers remaining after thousands of years. the unfinished ring hovers above the planet and the Enul storage planet can be seen hovering in orbit around the planet. \n\ncolonists arrived as pacifists; most unwilling or unable to fight. they built gigantic structures intended to gather resources, collect energy, and offer habitats. the ACP arrived hundreds of later and forced the original colonists into hiding before construction of their ring habitat was complete. Menesk arrive some time later (long enough to let the ACP spread all over the planet and expand a 200,000k colony into billions) they build their cities above the ACP civilizations underground. in the process, they instigate war somehow. consider plot holes. are the old colonists thought to be dead? why haven't they retaliated after all this time? (they're long gone, the characters I wrote are in a prequel, the AI is the only character that remains in the solar system) can droids exhibit human-like intelligence? robots built the original megastructures and the AEI has millions of them. \n\nKessler syndrome is the reason people are trapped on this planet. (or at least, it's thought to be the reason) \n\nACP civilizations are deep underground to protect themselves from radiation emitted from their gas giant. \n\nAre there bacteria that inhale nitrogen and exhale oxygen? Beautiful arauras.\n\nTechnology Notes\n\n\tEnul Spheres are designed to capture and store a stars energy and prevent it from being lost to entropy. They gather around a star in a dyson swarm and replicate as much as needed.\n\tColonist suit redistributes heat and kinetic energy into Enul Sphere found at the base of the users neck. The sphere will burst if overloaded to protect its user. Black when empty, white when optimal capacity, Orange when overcharged, blue when exceeding maximum capacity\n\tEnergy from these Enul Spheres can be converted into ammunition or expelled as steam.\n\tnanites are used to weld, polish, and maintain. but it's inefficient to build things from scratch with them. energy converters are more effective.\n\tnanobots do exist, but energy to matter conversion is better at building things. nanobots are best used for repair, medicine and disassembly.\n\tRing World - the ring around the planet is used to support a dome that retains the planet's atmosphere. how is that supported? a dome can be made opaque and simulate the planet's natural sun. safely transport the planet to the center of the galaxy when the it's gathered enough energy. \n\tWS colonists have suits that convert kinetic and heat energy into electricity. when converted, the energy is siphoned into an Enul sphere at the base of the suit's neck. this energy can be used to generate ammunition on command, transmute weapons, and power the suit's exoskeleton. however, the Enul sphere's, when overloaded with energy will Burst and expell all the gathered energy as quickly and safely as possible to prevent overload and explosion. this leaves the user vulnerable until the sphere is empty of energy. it can then be swapped out via revive or the user can wait until the suit converts enough of their body's heat into energy to move. to prevent this, the user can manually expel excess heat via steam, but there's a limit to how quickly this can be done as the expelled H2O needs to be replenished via transmutation. \n\tthe ring is partially destroyed and crashed into the planet. \n\tdyson swarm is still in effect and its actively storing all the star's output into planet-size sphere's orbiting the planet via Enul spheres. what would that look like from the planet?\n\tWafer sat colonists launched 3rd, but arrived 1st, ACP launched 1st but arrived 2nd, Menesk launched 2nd, (much later than the ACP) and arrived 3rd. visualize this timeline. explain each travel method\n\tACP launched their first generational ships from the solar system. X years later, the Menesk colony ship departs from the solar system. and a X after that, the wafer SATS are sent, traveling incredibly fast due to their small size. - the wafer SATS arrive first, gather resources, start a small colony, build a habitable ring around the planet, and create a dyson swarm. they discover multi-cellular life beneath the ice. the ACP arrive years later, colonize the planet and are greeted by the WS colonists what happens to incite war? Menesk arrive soon after and find ruins of the original colonists and a surviving AEI sometime after. \n\tSmall, lifeless planets are hollowed out and converted into Enul sphere storage. \n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: on-command-wiki-pages/old-narrative-context.txt\n- **Type**: wiki\n- **Tags**: wiki, on-command-wiki-pages, character-design, dialogue, weapon, story\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.229Z",

======\nHIV & Cancer CURED With Stem Cells | The Kyle Kulinski Show\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJumjXegiSk\n\n0:00\nall right y'all so this is something if\n0:02\nI don't say so myself third patient\n0:05\ncured of HIV after receiving stem cell\n0:08\ncancer treatment\n0:10\nhuh a man known as the Dusseldorf\n0:13\npatient has become the third person\n0:15\ndeclared Curative HIV after receiving a\n0:17\nstem cell transplant that also treated\n0:20\nhis leukemia a study said on Monday two\n0:22\nother cases with both HIV and cancer\n0:24\npatients in Berlin and London have\n0:26\npreviously been reported as cured in\n0:28\nscientific journals following the high\n0:30\nrisk procedure now the details of the\n0:32\nDusseldorf patient's cure have been\n0:34\nrevealed in the journal Nature medicine\n0:35\nthe 53 year old man whose name has not\n0:38\nbeen released was diagnosed with HIV in\n0:39\n2008 then three years later with acute\n0:41\nmyeloid leukemia life-threatening form\n0:43\nof blood cancer in 2013 he had a bone\n0:45\nmarrow transplant using stem cells from\n0:47\na female donor with a rare mutation in\n0:48\nher ccr5 Gene the mutation has been\n0:51\nfound to stop HIV from entering cells\n0:52\nthe Dusseldorf patient then ceased\n0:54\nantiretroviral therapy for HIV in 2018\n0:56\nfour years later consistent testing\n0:59\nfound no trace of HIV returning in his\n1:02\nbody the study said that quote this\n1:05\nthird case of HIV one cure provides\n1:09\nvaluable insights that will hopefully\n1:10\nguide future cure strategies\n1:13\nwow\n1:15\nso I don't I mean maybe we'll see more\n1:17\nin the article about this but I don't\n1:19\nknow if are they saying you have to have\n1:21\nHIV and cancer for this thing to work or\n1:23\ncan you get it with just HIV will it\n1:25\ncure it will it cure the leukemia on its\n1:28\nown I don't know these are open\n1:29\nquestions at least right now let's see\n1:31\nif they mentioned in the article the\n1:32\npatient said a statement that he was\n1:33\nproud of my worldwide team of doctors\n1:35\nwho succeeded in curing me of HIV and at\n1:37\nthe same time of course of leukemia he\n1:39\nsaid he celebrated in a big way the\n1:41\n10-year anniversary of his transplant on\n1:42\nValentine's Day last week adding that\n1:44\nthe donor was the guest of honor the\n1:46\nrecoveries of two more people with HIV\n1:47\nand cancer the so-called New York and\n1:50\nCity of Hope patients were announced at\n1:52\ndifferent scientific conferences last\n1:53\nyear\n1:54\nthough research has yet to be published\n1:56\non those cases while a cure for HIV has\n1:59\nlong been sought after the bone the bone\n2:01\nmarrow transplant involved in these\n2:03\ncases is a severe and dangerous\n2:05\noperation making it only suitable for a\n2:07\nsmall number of patients suffering from\n2:08\nboth HIV and blood cancers finding a\n2:11\nbone marrow there you go there's our\n2:12\nanswer finding a bone marrow donor with\n2:14\nthe rare ccr5 mutation can also be a\n2:17\nmajor challenge once one of the study's\n2:19\nco-authors\n2:20\nazir sayas Sirion of France's pasture\n2:23\nInstitute said that during the\n2:25\ntransplant quote the patient's immune\n2:26\ncells are completely replaced by those\n2:28\nof the donor which makes it possible for\n2:30\nthe vast majority of the infected cells\n2:32\nto disappear\n2:33\nthis is an exceptional situation when\n2:35\nall the factors coincide for this\n2:37\ntransplant to be a successful cure for\n2:39\nboth leukemia and HIV\n2:41\nwow that is quite a story right there\n2:43\nand I mean I don't know how much\n2:45\ncommentary I have to add to this other\n2:47\nthan\n2:48\nscience is incredible Jesus Christ how\n2:51\ndid they replace all the the stem cells\n2:53\nby the way just stem cell treatment in\n2:56\ngeneral it has a variety of applications\n2:58\nmost of them are experimental like\n3:01\nthey're not totally approved but there's\n3:03\nbeen some real good anecdotal evidence\n3:05\nthat this stuff works for a number of\n3:06\nthings\n3:08\num\n3:09\nRogan talks about how he had uh some\n3:11\npretty bad problem with his knee it\n3:13\nmight have been a torn meniscus or\n3:14\nsomething like that and he got some stem\n3:15\ncell injections and then it doesn't have\n3:17\nit right away but over time it just\n3:19\ntotally cured the issue\n3:21\num and he had an issue like he tried\n3:23\ndifferent treatments previously and had\n3:25\nno impact whatsoever and actually uh\n3:28\ncrystals has an issue with her knee so\n3:30\nyou know I hope we can get her some some\n3:32\nof the stem cell treatment at some point\n3:33\nbecause you know it bothers her quite\n3:35\noften it bothers her like it makes it\n3:37\nkind of hard for her to walk at certain\n3:39\ntimes but\n3:40\num\n3:41\nthat's amazing just that it does that\n3:44\nbut now you're hearing stories of stem\n3:47\ncell treatment that effectively cured\n3:50\nHIV and a particular kind of cancer it's\n3:52\nlike\n3:53\nwhen you read a story like this you\n3:55\nthink wow if they can do this they can\n3:57\ndo anything\n3:58\nright with enough time and enough data\n4:01\nuh you know you find\n4:04\nmaybe we have the ability to we will\n4:06\nhave the ability and do time to treat a\n4:08\nvariety of different illnesses that\n4:09\nright now we're sort of in the dark\n4:10\nabout I mean it reminds me of how\n4:12\nremember how they discovered uh\n4:13\npenicillin\n4:15\nantibiotics and how like it was an\n4:17\naccident\n4:18\nit was an accident that they discovered\n4:20\nand they realized oh my God this like\n4:22\nkills bacterial infections and so now if\n4:25\nyou have a bacterial you know illness\n4:28\nyou go to the doctor you get antibiotics\n4:30\nand it it works it just kills it just\n4:32\nstops IT dead I used to get strep throat\n4:34\nall the time as a kid and then you go\n4:36\nand you do whatever they gave you\n4:37\namoxicillin or whatever it is it's like\n4:38\nbubble gum flavored for the kid you\n4:40\ndrink it and uh you know you're better\n4:43\nlike very quickly\n4:44\nit's kind of amazing that we just like\n4:46\nsort of accidentally stumbled upon that\n4:47\nnow of course then now you have the\n4:49\nissue today of antibiotic resistant\n4:52\nuh anti antibiotics that are not they're\n4:55\nnot working as well as they once did so\n4:57\nthey have to keep you know making them a\n4:59\nlittle different or in some instances\n5:00\nthey go back to like the previous\n5:02\nold school generations of antibiotics in\n5:04\norder to try to uh you know defeat staph\n5:07\ninfection and things of that nature\n5:09\nso there's issues there but the fact\n5:10\nthat we stumbled across that is amazing\n5:11\nwe still at this late date have not\n5:14\nfound the antibiotic equivalent for\n5:17\nviruses I mean there's some antivirals\n5:20\nthat people could take that help in in\n5:21\none way or another and of course we have\n5:23\nvaccines which if you take it before\n5:24\nit'll make it so you you know you're\n5:27\nprotected from the worst effects of\n5:28\nvarious illnesses of various viruses I\n5:31\nshould say but we still don't have like\n5:33\nan antiviral treatment that's as\n5:34\neffective with viruses as antibiotics\n5:36\nare with bacterial infections\n5:38\num but look this stuff this stuff\n5:40\nfascinates me and um\n5:42\nit's weird one of the things you always\n5:44\ngo back to is like I always hear stem\n5:47\ncells are almost like a for many things\n5:49\nthey have the potential at least to be\n5:51\nsort of like a miracle cure\n5:54\nwhich is amazing you know it also you\n5:56\nguys remember when uh Vice did that\n5:59\nreport how they were they certain\n6:02\ncancers they found a way to cure with\n6:04\nthis experimental treatment where they\n6:05\ngave people they would give people a\n6:07\ndifferent illness and that illness would\n6:09\nlike eat all the cancer I don't remember\n6:11\nexactly what it was but there was a big\n6:12\nvice special I want to say back in like\n6:14\n2015 or something like that we covered\n6:16\non the show\n6:17\nbecause it was incredible results but I\n6:19\ndon't know I feel like the general\n6:20\nconsensus now is that they kind of\n6:21\noverstated how how good that stuff was\n6:23\nanyway\n6:24\num\n6:25\nreally interesting case science is\n6:27\namazing man it really is and these\n6:29\npeople are heroes who are coming up with\n6:30\nthese sorts of treatments to help people\n6:32\nbecause uh man that helps give you a lot\n6:34\nof a lot of hope that maybe we could\n6:37\nfigure out some of this terrible stuff\n6:38\nmoving forward Biden always talks about\n6:40\nwe're going to find a cure for cancer\n6:41\ndude just give everybody Universal\n6:43\nHealth Care first right like like this\n6:45\nwhole we're gonna you know do the moon\n6:46\nshot and try to cure cancer it's like we\n6:48\ncould just give everybody health care\n6:50\nand that would save 45\n6:52\n000 lives every single year\n6:54\nprobably more really\n6:56\nbut I mean curing cancer would be good\n6:58\ntoo but I guess I'm a little skeptical\n7:00\non that front to get some widespread\n7:02\ncancer cure\n7:03\nlike I said device thing it was certain\n7:06\nkinds of cancer and seemed to work\n7:08\ngiving them another Illness but I don't\n7:10\nknow\n7:11\nyou haven't heard much about it since\n7:12\nthen which leads you to believe maybe\n7:13\nthey did overstate it anyway\n7:16\num I hope this is not overstated because\n7:17\nthis is some phenomenal

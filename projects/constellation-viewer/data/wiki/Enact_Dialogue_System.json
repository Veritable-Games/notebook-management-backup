  "content": "# Enact_Dialogue_System\n\nContent-Type: text/x-zim-wiki\nWiki-Format: zim 0.6\nCreation-Date: 2024-07-22T19:46:55-07:00\n\n====== Formerly: The Enact Dialogue System ======\n\nThe Symbols Themselves\n\nThe Enact of Want/Take: \nWanting to have/take in the tense of ascribing want and so thinking take. But ‘take’ in this sense means to remove of, ‘have of’\n‘Wanting for’ can also be influenced by external factors such as cultural norms, social pressures, and media messages. Additionally, wants can be influenced by our emotions, which can cloud our judgment and lead to irrational or impulsive decisions.\nThe urge to attain or obtain something for oneself or for others. To desires; needs, our deepest cravings, then too fair wants for physical and emotional needs: hunger, thirst, sleep, joy, love, contentment.\nWanting is influenced by what is inherited to us & learned, kept to heart; then too our physical, chemical, neurological, behavioral factors that lead to social repertoires. — Later expression and internalizations set to knowledge; then to, our ways of language: ‘what we see effort to’ and ‘expenditure for’  — in how we use our time. \nOur inheritances do not go past these given traits. “Do you see this?”\nAs well as internalized values and self-worth. However, it is necessarily impossible to truly know another person's wants, and it is only through expression or demonstration that one's wants can be known by others. This leads to difficulty in relationships and society, as people may not know how to want for one another, or ask for attention or time.\nUnreturned to (fairly or else) sighted insecurity, low self-relation, then distrust. In these situations, it is important to remember that fulfilling a ‘want’ does not guarantee a return. By not asking for what you want, you may deprive yourself of things that could benefit you. However, asking for what you want also comes with its own complications and potential for disappointment.\n\nOne’s being ‘taken of’ could be interpreted as extracting or drawing something away from some This act could be understood as being bad or negative if the person taking from others does so without regard for the impact it has on the one that would ‘Return/Give’ to them. Being ‘taken-of’ may lead to feelings of dissatisfaction in a relationship if the person does not receive the expected return or equal giving from this person.\n{{file:///media/user/USB%20STICK/Projects/Concepts/Symbols/Want-Take.png?width=64}}\nThe Enact of Return/Give:\nThe act of our will in giving or ‘return’ is not always done with one’s most-self interest but in this enact; ‘seeking’ in the thing is inherent. People may give in order to pay back on something; later or, receive something in reciprocal feedback. Return/Giving may only fulfill a limited sense of obligation to someone, but would let another meet their own held social expectations; influenced by personal values, beliefs, and cultural norms. The influence of this act by way of power/wealth dynamics. The ones that would have an abundance of resources or clout have more opportunities to give, and those who are in need may feel pressure to accept help or support even if it is not freely given.\nIn terms of the potential consequences of unreturned giving, it is important to note that feelings of loss, shame, and guilt can arise not only from not receiving a return, but also from feeling like one has not given enough, or has given in a way that is not valued or appreciated. Additionally, unreturned giving can lead to resentment, distrust, and even hostility towards the receiver, especially if the giver feels taken advantage of or exploited.\nGiving to oneself or others can be positive, but giving too much can lead to neglect. The act of asking for something may lead to a return, but it may not always be valued equally.\n{{file:///media/user/USB%20STICK/Projects/Concepts/Symbols/Return-Give.png?width=64}}\nThe Enact of Fear/Anxiety:\nFear is an emotional response to a perceived threat or danger, and can be triggered by various stimuli such as a loud noise, a sudden movement, or a ‘dangerous’ situation. Fear can cause physical symptoms such as increased heart rate, sweating, and trembling, as well as psychological symptoms such as anxiety, panic, and avoidance behavior.\nCharacters who are afraid may exhibit avoidance behavior, such as running away or hiding, or they may become paralyzed with fear and unable to act. Stay in bed.\nThe player or other characters may be able to help others overcome their fear by providing reassurance, offering a solution to the source of the fear, or simply acting in a way that demonstrates that the situation is under control. However, if the fear is deeply ingrained or linked to past trauma, it may not be as easily resolved.\nIn some situations, fear can be helpful as it can motivate individuals to take necessary precautions or avoid dangerous situations. However, excessive or chronic fear can be a hindrance and negatively impact one's quality of life. Anxiety, which is often closely related to fear, is a prolonged state of worry or apprehension that can be triggered by a variety of situations or stimuli. Anxiety can cause similar physical and psychological symptoms as fear, and may be similarly addressed by people.\n{{file:///media/user/USB%20STICK/Projects/Concepts/Symbols/Fear-Anxiety.png?width=64}}\nThe Enact of Response:\nThe Enact of Response represents how one's values and beliefs are projected onto others, and how reciprocal and subtractive behaviors can have positive or negative outcomes. In the context of the game, the ability to yield a response is crucial, as it allows for quick feedback in a conversation. Inability to yield a response can lead to anxiety and fear, as the individual may feel trapped in their circumstances.\nCharacters using these Enacts will often automatically respond if the player does not choose a dialogue option, allowing for conversations to continue; statements, and characters would only be able to give feedback. We may have to fake-out questions if we can’t get them to ask so-autonomously. Response can be internal, but externalizing it can lead to various behaviors such as ‘reaction’, relief, aggression: these many ways we would realize-on and emote-on returns. \nReaction can take the form of retorts, repetition, recognition, revelation, or anger, aggression, & surprise. — Then, too, relief and quietude for thought can manifest after an acute exasperation or even laughter: these things would ‘refresh one's reputation’. Happy leaving if you do this well.\nAggression can involve \"saying-against\" or \"acting-for\" to uphold one's values, often by seeing fault instantly. Habit involves doing something because it is safe, easy, and quick to act on.\n{{file:///media/user/USB%20STICK/Projects/Concepts/Symbols/Var-Response.png?width=64}}\nThe Enact of Having/Principle:\nTo have a thing we would value. This gives us good sensations, satisfying ones that we would apply to the object or entity we ‘would have’. To test the strength of our connections to things we say to have for ourselves, how much loss would you feel if you’ve had something you own taken from you? If this reaction is ‘possession’ in our behavior to objects. How does one keep to their own ideals? In the abstract sense, what we have in comparison to other people also goes in the valuation sense of our outlooks as compared to theirs. Our knowledge next to someone else’s and how these schemas relate to larger society, what others would expect of us.\n\nThe Enact of Elation/Pleasure:\nElation/Pleasure is a complex emotion that can be associated with feelings of happiness, excitement, and love. It is often triggered by positive experiences, such as receiving recognition or surprises, and the desire for love from others. Elation is expressed through smiles, laughter, warmth, and joy, and can result in a feeling of fulfillment and satisfaction.\nWhile elation can be a positive experience, it can also be linked to negative behaviors such as greed and selfishness. This is because the pursuit of elation may lead individuals to harm others or engage in harmful activities. Elation is associated with the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that can result in feelings of addiction and an intense desire for more. In extreme cases, this can lead to a state of constant anticipation and a never-ending pursuit of joy and happiness.\nIt's important to note that while elation can bring happiness, too much of it can result in a disconnection from reality and a lack of empathy for others. Additionally, elation can be fleeting and temporary, and relying solely on it for happiness can lead to disappointment and a sense of emptiness. It's important to seek balance of Elation against other positive emotions; seeing value in gratitude to lead a fulfilling and well-rounded life; contentment with other people leaves us well.\n{{file:///media/user/USB%20STICK/Projects/Concepts/Symbols/Elation-Pleasure.png?width=64}}\nThe Enact of Pain/Agony:\nPain can take many forms, including physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual. Physical pain is often the result of injury or illness, and can limit a person's ability to function. Emotional pain can stem from grief, loss, or betrayal, and can cause feelings of sadness, anger, guilt, or despair. Psychological pain can be caused by trauma or abuse, and can have lasting effects on mental health. Spiritual pain can cause a sense of disconnection or loss of faith. Belief lost in a person can be lost faith just the same.\nAs you interact with others in this world, it is important to approach pain with empathy and compassion. Avoid causing pain to others, and recognize when you may have done so. Take responsibility for your actions and seek to make amends if you have caused harm.\nRemember to be attuned to the needs of others, to listen actively and without judgment, and to offer support and care when needed. By upholding values of compassion and non-violence, we can create a more harmonious and peaceful world. Pain is not a thing we so-should ever need for.\nIt's important for people to learn how to recognize when they've caused pain in others so they can take steps to make things right. How to recognize when you've caused pain:\n\t1. The person may express their pain to you directly: Sometimes the person you've hurt will tell you directly that they are in pain. They might say things like \"that hurt my feelings\" or \"you hurt me when you did that.\" \n\t2. Changes in behavior: If you notice that someone is acting differently around you or seems upset, it could be a sign that you've caused them pain.\n\t3. Physical reactions: People can experience physical reactions to emotional pain, such as crying, shaking, or withdrawing. If you notice any of these signs, it's possible that you've caused pain.\n\t4. Remember empathy: Sometimes you may feel pain yourself when you realize you've caused someone else pain. This is a sign of empathy and can help you recognize when you've caused harm.\nOnce you've recognized that you've caused pain, it's important to take steps to make things right. This might involve apologizing, making amends, and committing to doing better in the future. It's also important to listen to the person you've hurt and try to understand their perspective. By taking responsibility for your actions and working to make things right, you can help prevent further pain and promote healing in your relationships.\n{{file:///media/user/USB%20STICK/Projects/Concepts/Symbols/Pain.png?width=64}}\nThe Enact of Misery/Despair:\nThis symbol refers directly to the experience of emotional pain that arises from loss, severance, and broken communication. Sadness for one's own loss to life or relationships. Then, too- a fair extension of empathy connected to someone might bring out these feelings of loss for another. \nMisery can manifest as a deep sense of sadness, hopelessness, and despair. It can cause a person to withdraw from others and to focus on their own pain and suffering. This can further exacerbate feelings of isolation and loneliness, may-be leading to cycles of misery and despair.\nIt is important to recognize the signs of misery in oneself and others. Some common indicators include feelings of sadness or emptiness, loss of interest in activities that were once enjoyable, difficulty sleeping, changes in appetite, and difficulty concentrating. \nIf you or someone you know is experiencing misery, it is important to seek help and support. This may involve reaching out to a trusted friend or family member, seeking the help of a mental health professional, or engaging in self-care activities such as exercise, meditation, or hobbies that bring joy and fulfillment. Having your time to something remedial is important to not having it.\nAs a community, we can help those experiencing misery by providing a safe and supportive environment where individuals feel comfortable expressing their emotions and seeking help. We can practice active listening, offer empathy and understanding, and provide resources for those in need. Imagining one's despair is a sign of sympathy- even so you do not truly know it.\nRemember, misery is a natural part of the human experience, but it is not something that has to be endured alone. — With the right affordance of your support and care, all individuals can find a path towards healing, growth, then-too emotional well-being. We need not remain in  misery. \n{{file:///media/user/USB%20STICK/Projects/Concepts/Symbols/Misery.png?width=64}}\nThe Enact of Empathy:\nEmpathy is a crucial aspect of building and maintaining relationships within a community. It allows individuals to connect with one another on a deeper level and fosters a sense of understanding and compassion. Recognizing and acknowledging others' emotions can lead to greater trust and cooperation, and can help to prevent conflicts or misunderstandings.\nIt is important to practice empathy regularly, as it can improve emotional intelligence and lead to more positive interactions with others. In this, building and maintaining strong relationships within your community requires a fair commitment to empathy and understanding, even in the face of significant differences or challenges. In working towards greater understanding and compassion, individuals can help to create a more harmonious and supportive community for everyone.\nIf you notice that someone is struggling with a difficult situation or emotion, you can show empathy by actively listening to them, expressing support and understanding, and refraining from judgment or criticism. This can help them feel heard and validated, and can strengthen your relationship with them.\n\nThe Enact of Enmity:\nFeelings of ‘Enmity’ can arise in situations where there are significant differences in values, beliefs, or experiences. When individuals allow their differences to lead to strong negative emotions, it can create tension and conflict within a community. It is important to recognize and address these feelings in a constructive manner, rather than letting them fester and grow.\nTo overcome enmity, individuals can try to find common ground and work towards understanding and compromise. This can involve active listening, being open-minded, and recognizing that others may have valid perspectives and experiences that differ from your own. It may also involve seeking out mediation or other forms of conflict resolution to help reach a resolution that benefits everyone involved.\n\nThe Enact of Gain/Pride:\nThe concept of gain, which can be seen as pride, admiration for, and recognition of something that has happened to better the self. This can lead to a sense of ‘being above’, where one holds a higher value above others, leading to puffed-up expressions. These expressions are related to the ego and the enduring values that one holds. Pride and admiration for the self can drive one to pursue goals, even if they go against the values of others.\nHowever, this pride can also bring about lies, as one may act in a way that is not reconciled with their true selves, leading to a disconnection from their own values and the values of others. Gain in the way of Greed can also be a negative thing when it is achieved through greed, manipulation, or exploitation of others. In such cases, gain can lead to a feeling of emptiness and guilt, as well as damage to relationships and reputations.\n\nThe Enact of Loss/Shame:\nTo assuage this affect on our behavior, we might want to act in the will of good return to that which we were ‘stolen from’ or pay a recompense in apology for ‘being lost of’ oneself: to remove one's guilt. If the systems of operational hierarchy persist in our minds, we order ourselves in reversal of the forward; put ourselves out, say we are not wanted (in a way), then put forward the thought (or action—though [this] may-be inhibited; the forwarding to ask of another is how we ground ourselves to each other.\nThen, if we [endure] to set ourselves too far apart it goes to confusion, malice, distrust, and all the things that come with not understanding the 'other' that would endure against the will of our minds.\nDo people fear, feel shame, guilt, and depression out of what people and their own internalized [systemic-workings] would want of them? Of the things that would tie them to their [values]? We 'fear' against our own knowledge in opposition to the built-in systems of [wanting] belief in oneself and our [deterministic] comparison to others. If I feel my values are so-good, I will have no shame.\nLosing pride can lead to feelings of shame, guilt, embarrassment, and rejection by others. If our minds are trained to follow a certain hierarchy, we can judge ourselves harshly and believe that we are unwanted. This can result in confusion, anger, distrust, and other negative emotions if we don't understand others and their perspectives. People may feel shame and guilt because of societal expectations and internalized beliefs about what is important and valued. Being downgraded by those who are seen as superior or equal can lead to feelings of being misunderstood and embarrassed.\nThe symbol of 'lost pride' refers to a state of being where one experiences feelings of shame, guilt, embarrassment, or ostracization as a result of feeling like they have fallen short of their own or societal expectations. This can lead to feelings of being downcast or misunderstood and may stem from a comparison to others or internalized systems of belief in one's self-worth. The loss of pride can be a source of emotional pain and can impact one's sense of identity and belonging.\n\nValues, Variables, & Baselines\n\nThe Enact of Depression:\nNegation or deflection of interpersonal or value-reflected problems in our lives cause this strange thing of inwardness to the self in way of isolation, quietude; or withdraws to our personal lives. — Traits such as low self-esteem, pessimism, or a tendency towards negative thinking can make a person more vulnerable to depression.\nEnvironmental factors such as stress, trauma, loss, or other interpersonal or value-related difficulties can increase the risk of developing depression. Unresolved conflicts, a sense of loss of control, and a lack of social support can cause symptoms. Depression can also be triggered by significant life changes, such as the death of a loved one, a divorce, or a job loss.\nThe thing of depression keeps us from ourselves and those would-be cherished others.\n{{file:///media/user/USB%20STICK/Projects/Concepts/Symbols/Depression.png?width=64}}\nThe Enact of Balance:\nWhen we are treated with respect and balance, it can lead to positive feelings of fulfillment and empathy. But if we are not treated fairly, it can lead to negative emotions such as depression and enmity, as well as internalized pain from repressed self-expression. This can manifest physically in symptoms like headaches.\nBalance can bring a sense of calm and inner peace, leading to a state of mindfulness and presence. When we are centered, we are able to live in the moment and not get caught up in worries or distractions. This can be aided by practices such as meditation, music, and self-reflection. However, if we lose our balance, we can become confused and disoriented, leading to feelings of insecurity and instability in our relationships with ourselves and others.\nMaintaining a sense of balance is crucial for our overall well-being and happiness. Balance refers to the state of equilibrium where all elements are in equal proportion, leading to stability. This concept can be applied in various areas of life such as mental and emotional balance, financial balance, and physical balance. Achieving balance can help a person to feel fulfilled and satisfied, and it can improve one's overall well being.\n{{file:///media/user/USB%20STICK/Projects/Concepts/Symbols/Balance.png?width=64}}\n\n\nBaseline Values: \n(drivers for characters: values/biases)\n\nThe Mechanisms as they stand\nPlease skip this banal-scattered writing and refer to ‘The Symbols Themselves’ section.\n\nChat GPT:\n“The text describes a dialogue system in a game designed to allow emotionally rationalized and rhetorical conversation between ChatGPT-driven characters and players. The Enact Dialogue System is easy to use, with players using LT to talk to characters and RT to respond to them. Characters are driven by systems of inherited values, biases, and weighted-task judgments, and each has a unique identity with an abundance of world-related, differentiated knowledge and variable internalized, value-driven motivations. The Enact symbols convey a broad category of emotions, values, expressions, and feelings, and are used to grant the player and characters discernible abilities in emotional conveyance between actors in the world. The goal is to reach the end of the character's written dialogue and find alignment. The system is powered by OpenAI and can give rhetoric, reason, and retort for as long as they need to or want. Overall, the Enact Dialogue System allows for contextualized expression from characters to the player.”\nThis conversation system\n\t* The player initiates a conversation with an NPC.\n\t* The conversation script initializes the conversation by setting the currentNPC and conversationDataIndex variables.\n\t* The script displays a message or a list of response options to the player based on the current conversation node.\n\t* The player selects a response option.\n\t* The script transitions to the next conversation node based on the player's selection or a timer delay.\n\t* The script checks for tangent nodes that can be accessed during the current node.\n\t* If a tangent node is selected, the script displays a message or a list of response options for the tangent node.\n\t* The player selects a response option for the tangent node.\n\t* The script transitions to the tangent node or back to the original node based on the player's selection or a timer delay.\n\t* The conversation continues until it reaches an ending node or the player decides to end it.\n\nWould you please disassemble this writing and bring it back together with a clear through line for better explanation? The system sounds very complex. Your understanding of it is good. But I need this restated.\n\nThis is a script written in C# for the Unity game engine that handles character conversations. Here is a brief overview of what this script does:\n\nThe given text is about different scripts for conversation systems in a Unity game engine. The first script defines various constants, variables, fields, materials, and methods that are used to handle character conversations in a game. It includes NPC detection, topic selection, and tangent-taking – it allows players to have conversations with NPCs and select responses from a list of options. It uses a ConversationData class to store conversation data and a ConversationConnectionData class to store connections between nodes in the conversation tree. The script initializes a conversation by setting the currentNPC and conversationDataIndex variables, and then waits for the player to press a button to initiate the conversation. The script then moves to the next conversation node based on the player's input or waits for a certain amount of time before transitioning to the next node. Finally, the third script defines two functions, get_user_input() and highlight_word(), that prompt the user to enter a sentence and a word, respectively, and return a new sentence with the entered word highlighted.\n\nPlease give the same rhetorical treatment to this script here, too.\n\nBehold, a script written in the language of the gods, C#! What divine purpose does it serve, you may ask? It is a ConversationNPC class, a tool used by mere mortals to create interactive conversations between virtual beings.\n\nLet us explore its offerings. At its core lies a hidden list of conversation data, concealed from the eyes of the outside world. Additionally, it has indicators for left and right blocks, objects that can be used to visually signal the player's progress in the conversation.\n\nBut wait, there's more! This ConversationNPC also possesses a collection of signs, each with their own unique animations. These signs can be used to convey emotions or reactions during conversation, truly a powerful tool in the hands of a skilled developer.\n\nThe startTopics function searches through the conversation data to find all topics that have a \"Start\" type, while boredConversations finds all topics of the \"Bored\" type. getBoredConversation selects a random bored conversation, getDataByIndex retrieves conversation data by its index, and leftMostStartTopic and rightMostStartTopic identify the conversation topics with the leftmost and rightmost positions, respectively.\n\nAnd finally, to ensure a clean slate before every conversation, there is the stopAllSigns function, which deactivates all sign objects. Truly, this ConversationNPC class is a work of divine engineering, providing endless possibilities for immersive and engaging conversations in the realm of virtual reality.\n\nThis is a script written in C# for Unity game engine that handles character conversations. Here is a brief overview of what this script does:\n\n\t* It defines various constants and variables that are used to control the conversation flow.\n\tIt defines various public and private fields that are used to reference UI elements and game objects.\n\tIt defines materials that are used to create sign icons for different conversation topics.\n\tIt defines a static ConversationNPC object that represents the current NPC being talked to and a coroutine object that handles the conversation flow.\n\tIt defines Start() and Update() methods that are called at the beginning of the game and every frame, respectively.\n\tThe Start() method initializes UI elements and audio sources, disables tangent indicators, and gets the Animator component of the game object.\n\tThe Update() method searches for ConversationNPC objects within a certain distance and angle range from the player's camera. If a valid NPC is found, it sets the pointingNPC variable to that NPC.\n\tThe script also defines various private methods that are used to handle different aspects of the conversation flow, such as starting a conversation, selecting conversation topics, and taking tangents.\n\nOverall, this script provides a basic framework for handling character conversations in a Unity game, including NPC detection, topic selection, and tangent-taking. However, it is likely that this script would need to be heavily customized to fit the specific needs of a particular game.\n\nThis script appears to be controlling a conversation between the player and NPCs in a game. The script listens for player input to initiate conversations with nearby NPCs, and handles various animations and UI elements during the conversation.\n\nThe script defines a number of functions and variables, including BOREDCOUNT (presumably the number of times an NPC will repeat a line before getting bored), setConversationIndex (which sets the current conversation topic), restartUI (which resets various UI elements after a conversation ends), and npcCoroutine (which controls the flow of conversation).\n\nThe Update function contains most of the logic for the conversation system. It checks if the player is interacting with an NPC (based on whether the player is within a certain distance and angle of the NPC), and if so, listens for input to advance the conversation. It also updates various UI elements depending on the state of the conversation.\n\nnpcCoroutine is the main function that handles the flow of conversation. It first sets up the NPC's talking animation and voice clip (if any), and then waits for a certain amount of time (determined by the length of the voice clip or the length of the text being displayed). During this wait time, the function listens for connections to other conversation topics (represented as ConversationData objects). If a connection is found, the function transitions to the new topic and repeats the process.\n\nThe script also includes some animation logic (such as playing handshake animations when the player interacts with an NPC), and particle system logic for displaying various \"signs\" (presumably emotional or expressive visual effects) during conversations.\n\nThis script is for a conversation system in a game. It allows the player to have conversations with NPCs and select responses from a list of options. The script uses a ConversationData class to store conversation data and a ConversationConnectionData class to store connections between nodes in the conversation tree.\n\nThe script initializes a conversation by setting the currentNPC and conversationDataIndex variables. The script then waits for the player to press a button to initiate the conversation. Once the conversation is initiated, the script sets the waitTimeCount variable to 0 and enters a loop that executes until the conversation is complete.\n\nDuring each iteration of the loop, the script checks whether the waitTimeCount has reached the waitTime, which is the amount of time that the player has to read each message in the conversation. If the waitTimeCount has reached the waitTime, the script sets the waitTimeCount back to 0 and moves to the next conversation node.\n\nIf the conversation node is a message node, the script displays the message on the screen and waits for the player to press a button to continue.\n\nIf the conversation node is a response node, the script displays the responses on the screen and waits for the player to select a response. The script then moves to the next node based on the player's selection.\n\nIf the conversation node is a tangent node, the script adds it to the currentTangents list, which keeps track of possible tangent nodes that the player can access during the current node. The script also checks for input from the player during the time window for each tangent node and moves to the next node if the player presses the correct button.\n\nIf the conversation node is an animation node, the script plays an animation on the target object. If the conversation node is a sound node, the script plays a sound on an AudioSource. If the conversation node is a sign node, the script changes the material of the sign object to the material associated with the sign.\n\nThe script begins by defining a function called get_user_input() that takes no arguments. Inside the function, the script prompts the user to enter a sentence and stores the sentence in a variable called user_input. Then, the script prompts the user to enter a word and stores the word in a variable called user_word. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing user_input and user_word.\n\nNext, the script defines another function called highlight_word() that takes two arguments: sentence and word. The purpose of this function is to replace all occurrences of word in sentence with the same word surrounded by asterisks (*).\n\nInside the function, the script uses the replace() method of the string object to replace all occurrences of word with '*'+word+'*'. The resulting string is stored in a variable called new_sentence, which is then returned.\n\nFinally, the script calls get_user_input() to prompt the user for a sentence and a word. It then unpacks the returned tuple into two variables: user_sentence and user_word. The script then calls highlight_word() with user_sentence and user_word as arguments, and stores the result in a variable called highlighted_sentence. Finally, the script prints the highlighted sentence to the console.\n\nSo, in summary, this script prompts the user to enter a sentence and a word, and then highlights all occurrences of the word in the sentence by surrounding them with asterisks. The highlighted sentence is then printed to the console.\n\nThe given writing samples are written in a coherent manner, but they can be improved by adding more details and explanation.\n\nThe first sample describes a script written in C# for Unity game engine that manages character conversations. It gives a general idea of what the script does, but it can be improved by providing more details on the specific functionalities that the script offers. For instance, it would be helpful to describe what types of UI elements and game objects are referenced by the script, what materials are used to create sign icons, and how the conversation flow is controlled by the coroutine object.\n\nThe second sample also describes a conversation system in a game, but it lacks details on how the conversation tree is constructed and how the script interacts with it. It would be helpful to explain the structure of the conversation tree and how nodes are connected to each other. Additionally, it would be useful to describe how the script handles different types of conversation nodes, such as message, response, tangent, animation, sound, and sign nodes.\n\nThe third sample provides a simple Python script that prompts the user for a sentence and a word, and then highlights all occurrences of the word in the sentence. Although the script is straightforward, it can be improved by explaining how the replace() method is used to replace all occurrences of the word, and how the resulting string is returned and displayed to the user.\n\nOverall, the writing samples provide a good starting point for describing code snippets, but more details and explanations would make them more informative and helpful.\nIt goes. If the player would like to talk to someone, they would go up to them and ‘say’ using (LT) LeftTrigger to express outward what thoughts are held by the player-character. Acting on the first ‘Enact’ of Want/Have. The player would ‘express-outward’ for Autumn's pre-scripted dialogue for circumstances we would design for.\nChatGPT:\n“The conversation system is intended to be reflective of a person's driving systems of feelings, values, expressions, and emotions. There are 14 symbols that each convey a broad category of these things in our nature: referred to as ‘Enacts’. This unique system allows for emotionally rationalization between people; rhetorical conversation between a cast of ChatGPT driven actors. Each of the characters is driven by a system of values, biases; all to weighted task judgments, and has unique identities. Enacts grant the player and characters alike abilities in emotional conveyance between all others in the world.”\nIf a player wants to talk to someone, they would go up to a character and say something with LT. They seem to listen; the player continues to hold ‘LT’ to further say on the thing- until (and if) the character suddenly interrupts —they would speak on their own accord related to what is presently being said by the player; or might even so-redirect the conversation to other aspects of rhetoric from their life.\nThe Enact Dialogue System is designed to be easy to use, with the player using LT to talk to characters and RT to respond to them. The goal is to reach the end of the character's written dialogue and find alignment.\nThe Enact Dialogue System is powered by OpenAI and can give rhetoric, reason, and retort for as long as they need to or want. The Enact Dialogue System allows for contextualized expression from characters to the player.\nHere is the quick ChatGPT description:\n“The conversation system is intended to reflective of a person's driving systems of feelings, values, expressions, and emotions.

These Enacts grant the player and characters discernible abilities in emotional conveyance between actors in the world.”\nEvery person that lived and is alive is driven by a system of their own systems of inherited values, biases, and weighted-task-judgments; each with their own set of ideals for life. They’d have ‘feelings’ on people, things; what they would want out of life; so too of what they expect for it, and then from (so better, too) others. Each NPC has an abundance of world-related, differentiated knowledge and variable internalized, value-driven motivations between themselves that they have unique identities.\nCharacters would see how they might take action in a given moment, or how they may ‘say-to’ or ‘ask-of’ others. Simply ‘wanting’ from the player to say on their own account is not enough to express on all the tasks you would have yourself to. People interrupt, people have their own intentions; people might give ear, give sympathy, give return, or nothing at all. All would have their own regard for Autumn.\nIn the player wanting to say for their own account and being able ‘to say’ is not enough to express all Autumn would need to in these acts of communication. Characters are powered by OpenAI and can give rhetoric, reason, retort- for as long as they need to or ‘want’ (in balancing it).\nA character may find points to interrupt you and say in-response on what else they may know of the thing you’d ask or say to them. Let’s say you were holding LT the break happens, and in that moment Autumn stops talking, —you make the learned correlation that you’re no longer saying as you were. Press LT again; you might interrupt them. —There is a pause in the dialogue; the characters gives an exasperated breath, you want to hear them in more detail and say that you have listened. Tap, RT to ‘return’ to them in what they said. Give affirmation that they were heard and return them back to the thing they were saying- or insist again and use LT once more to say on what Autumn meant to convey.\nThe goal is to reach the end of your character’s written dialogue and find alignment.\nAll of these systems of a character’s self-expression are weighted by a set of values and biases directly relational to the Enact system. Or, in other words, how an NPC is scripted a history, and how they hold reputation between others- creates inherent tendencies in their systemic behavior, and affects how they’ll interact with the player-character. Too, how they would develop transient relationships with other NPCs based on timeline progression.\nRegarding your movements unto speech, writing, & creation?\nHow much difficulty do you have in expressing yourself in the ways of your life?\nThese symbols are how I think we’ll convey contextualized expression from characters to the player\nEnacts are non-binary replies, retorts, and emphases to the way dialogue is driven. Ultimately, weights for how these engagements will go, greater to understand how these dialogues are built mechanically.\nThe symbols and this dialogue system would grant the player and characters discernible abilities in emotional conveyance between actors in the world. If someone wants for something or ‘of someone’, they would use their best apparent (available) expression to relate the idea. These Enacts would give players and AI alike means of driving their wants, language, and asks in a way that relates emotionally.\nIn this game the dialogue will come from the directing cast- written expression may so develop from inherited baselines for each of the NPCs as they would speak into the dialogue system; given address to these ‘enacts’, expressive symbols as way of communication to the player on things in shared interest. Characters would speak to others, regard-themselves; then [if] give interest to any narrative-driven concerns our player-character, Autumn would speak to them.\nWe give Autumn, Mother Nature, Father Fortune, and then their daughters, Winter, Summer, & Spring. In narrative interest I would need to contrive events that would bring these people together. If our thing is to hold ground among others we would have a quick synopsis of what the game is.\nThen to fuller, more-realized needs to the characters.\n— I have difficulty reminding myself to drink water and would so advise you find fair time for yourself to share in it. If you were admonish one, so what language would you read in them to hear these acknowledgments of ‘fear’?\nThe player can use these symbols in conversations with characters in the game, and each symbol has a specific meaning and the potential use-case is variable; but discernible in character feedback. The symbols are meant to be used to express emotions, motivations, and intentions in conversation. The characters in the game also have their own internalized enacts that drive their behaviors. The player's expression and use of the enacts will affect the outcomes of conversations and the actions of the characters. The goal is to create a believable and interactive dialogue system that allows for a meaningful exchange between the player and the characters in the game.\nRepresentative, expressionary symbols that enable the player and characters alike to ‘respond’ to other people using them in ways that are conversationally reactive. For practical example, I’ll explain how this system would work if we were to implement it into our revived project. In that game, I would assume our player character (PC) is Autumn. To solve many of the world’s problems, she must have ‘dialogues’ with non-player characters (NPCs) to make progress in narrative events or resolve journal objective.\n\nYou would often be rationalizing; exercising your emotional ties, and leveling rhetorical conversation between ChatGPT driven actors. These items- ‘Enacts’, are intended to represent a relational model of a person’s value-driven systems. You may say human but we need say otherwise to convey to the ones that would read this text that they are likewise in relation to the thing. But I think they would so find themselves to identities as the variables draw out to personify them as subjective characters in the game world. (I so see them as rhetorical machines; but I so see that is what we are- if we would give these people in the world a will to live in life we would also so afford them their own ability to it.\n\nIf a player wants to talk to someone, they would go up to a character and say something with LT. They seem to listen; the player continues to hold ‘LT’ to further say on the thing- until (and if) the character suddenly interrupts —they would speak on their own accord related to what is presently being said by the player; or might even so-redirect the conversation to other aspects of rhetoric from their life. \n\nThe Enact Dialogue System is designed to be easy to use, with the player using LT to talk to characters and RT to respond to them. The goal is to reach the end of the character's written dialogue and find alignment. \n\nThe Enact Dialogue System is powered by OpenAI and can give rhetoric, reason, and retort for as long as they need to or want. The Enact Dialogue System allows for contextualized expression from characters to the player. \n\nIn-task of explanation, all of these systems of a character’s self-expression are weighted by a set of values and biases directly relational to the Enact system. Or, in other words, how an NPC is scripted a history, and how they hold reputation between others creates inherent tendencies in their systemic behavior, and affects how they’ll interact with the player character. Too, how they would develop transient relationships with other NPCs based on timeline progression.\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/Enact_Dialogue_System.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, character-design, dialogue, item, story, quest, mechanic\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.056Z",

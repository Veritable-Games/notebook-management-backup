You don't always have to use them when you\nfeel the necessary, when you feel the need, if you if you need to express a certain emotion\nyou can use the dotax, but you've a limited selection per conversation because of the gradient\nof communication, then I'm trying to transpose onto the player progression system, two then\nfour then name, two then four then six then name and 12, and 12, just like I lost the\nhead. Hopefully this is getting more and more concise. It's a slow process, but the iteration\nis helping.\n\n\n====== REC007.txt ======\nIs there an adaptation I can take to see better in the dark in low light?\n\n\n====== REC008.txt ======\nWhy don't people get me dirty?\nWhy am I not totally trusting in this area?\nIt's so comfortable, so peaceful, but there's a...\nIt's a way in the neighborhood, there's a lot of grass and lush green areas.\nThere's families, there's friends.\nIt's a close-knit, social space, but it's not close enough, in any sense.\nBecause there's not means for all these people to interact with each other.\nWe're all going to different places.\nImagine if...\nBack up, back up, back up.\nI need to define the different spaces and their subgroups.\nSo, something like this.\n\n\n====== REC009.txt ======\nThere are no cars, there are no roads, but there are modern rails, and some ways, and\nall these. There are means of transportation, down walking, but walking is so convenient. So,\nand I'm started by roads that you can walk to everywhere you need to go and interact with\nthose people on the way socially. That's the players doing, they're going through an area,\nthe road is, this, seven social space. You're moving on to 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, etc. until you have\nno problem with specters. Okay, let's get back, get back, get back, get back, get back, get back, get back, get back.\n\n\n====== REC010.txt ======\nPetro.\nSheriff Lockway.\nNo, no, necessarily.\nPetro.\nPetro.\nPetro.\nIn different entrances at this space, it's like a...\nIt's cozy in the way there's right now.\nHere are four petrooms.\nYeah, four petrooms.\nFour petrooms is optimal.\nBecause you have four friends in a given space.\nFour friends is optimal.\nBut you only have to read your environments.\nThe fourth interaction with me was what kind of...\nIt makes things a little more dynamic.\nBut we're missing that.\nSo, the overall apartment size is four petrooms.\nAnd there's a...\nWhat do you call it, ale?\nThere's the hearts.\nThere's the room and the dining room.\nThe dining room is not seven in the kitchen.\nThe kitchen and the dining room.\nOne of the things is that whether you see a kitchen surface space,\nthey can be checked, or they can be intricate.\nBut they don't need to be circular.\nThey can be...\nThey can be a table center.\nThey can be enough for D&D.\nIt's also a social space.\nThat kind of thing.\nFour.\nWe love creative games.\nAnd we have AR.\nIt's a great way of doing that.\nD&D.\nImagine D&D in these spaces.\nOr the other AR game with your friends.\nIt's not as discontent as what...\nI'm sure there's that.\nThere's really no difference in interactions.\nBut this interaction is just...\nGood for them.\nJust as efficient.\nSo they interact with each other.\nBasically, instead of online,\nthat will set them to interact online.\nIf your friends away, they can join the D&D session digitally.\n\n\n====== REC011.txt ======\n紐 constitutional\n1革近\n1革近\n4-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5\n4-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5\n1-2-3-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4\n\n\n====== REC012.txt ======\nOkay, I'm stuck inside for a break.\nThis is working.\nWe're going to take our core inside.\nIf we want to read.\nLet's have a torture.\nOh my god.\nLook at that.\nNot behind when I'm trying to read.\nI got me this space goes here. There it is.\nBecause I'm excited to get something high.\nWhen I'm sober.\nAnd when I'm high, I'm excited as reduced.\nSo I don't know.\nWhat should I do there?\n\n\n====== REC013.txt ======\nbit by bit, a little by little. I'm working to create a lifetime magnum opus, ongoing production,\nand I have a Patreon-like system. The game is 30-puxed entry, the purchase, the play.\nAnd then the player, we get them pre-content over time. Those are the truths to pay.\nThose are the truths to not pay the content. But the Patreon people are appreciated in the community\nfor what they're doing. Or they people in this community also like to see the direction of the game\nand want it to expand. It's like when you spend money on a game and it's not so expensive,\nyou don't think of the cash you think about how it's a donation towards what they've accomplished.\nBut we're famous a little more greedy about that. Not greedy necessarily, greedy merit, because they need to survive.\nSo this is a grinding nature to it. But I think I can do away with the grinding nature. I don't want grinding nature at all.\nI want gradual for, I want like, first six hours of content, five hours of content, or at least a free 30 bucks.\nAnd then over time, we introduce new content. Bit by bit, little by little, we introduce new content to the player\nthrough Patreon-like updates that span the course of continued development.\nIf our team can manage the cash flow carefully without expanding scope too far,\notherwise we'll impede progress. It needs to be a close barrier city.\nI'm going to describe it now in a game. That's the third and the size for it.\n\n\n====== REC014.txt ======\nMonson noted I am meant I'm crazy from and on maybe I am probably crazy and we\nJeez just gonna sound so out there, but protons are gluons and\nNo, that's not right stepping back. That's wrong\n\n\n====== REC015.txt ======\nProtons are photons. They just haven't caught particulates yet. They're not massless.\nThey contain the forces, gravitation, and that the weakened nuclear forces, the smaller versions of those.\nAnd then when there's enough particulates there, it starts to gather mass.\nSo when we say it travels to speed of light, hypothetically because we've only been here, we've only seen light travel for about 200,000 years.\nBut we're looking into the past by about 13.8 billion years. Our planet's been around for about 4.5 billion years.\nAnd we're looking into the past, but we're not. The past hasn't cut off to us yet.\nHere's to the past. It's time resolution. It's light has limited speed.\nOr a limited maximum speed within our radius of vision right now. It can go further.\nTrue black hole. It just does take time, but we haven't seen the end of that.\nA maximum length of distance between us and the super-maker collective ultra-black hole at the center of our galaxy, our universe, I should say.\nQuasar. Super-maker Quasar. Like the one that's inside the center of our Milky Way.\nWe're like rotating bodies, our solar system, but the distance from that super-maker, the ultra-quasar, is almost incomprehensible, the distance from that.\nYes.\nLet's see if we're ready.\n\n\n====== REC016.txt ======\nmodular bedrooms\n\n\n====== REC017.txt ======\n오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오오\n\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/10_Oct_2019_-_New_folder_(23).txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, character-design, dialogue\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.007Z",

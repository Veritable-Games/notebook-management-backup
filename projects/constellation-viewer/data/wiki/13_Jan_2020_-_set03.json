It's like a tram on gathering up a little free.\nSo they believe it's just to be an area of reputation because for some reason,\nthe structure is not dense enough. And as it turns out,\nlike the scenes, they can't dig into it, they can't penetrate the surface,\nor they can't work too far into it. It's going to look into the tunnel network\nfor people to live in with the current mutation.\nAnd it's a little of equal mass spread out throughout the sphere,\nthat way gravitational pull doesn't deviate to much,\nand it's built around the mass of humans.

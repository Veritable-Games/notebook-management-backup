======\nSo, the forward by Jim Cathart, I want to introduce the book here, how to work a room,\na guy and two successfully managing the mingling. They say that by Jim Cathart,\nC-P-A-E, author of relationships selling, how to get and keep customers.\nThey say that in this world, it's not what you know, but who you know.\nNo other book I have seen will do more for you than this one in the area of making connections\nin developing professional contacts. Exceptional business leaders have one single talent\nthat sets them apart from all others. They're about to develop business friendships.\nBusiness friendships can cement an empire or they can simply make a professional dinner\nmore enjoyable and profitable. Ideally, these friendships are low intention,\nhigh incorporation based on mutual trust and they desire to both people to help and support each other.\nTo develop these kinds of friendships, you need to persuade people that you can make their business,\na little more successful. Their days are a little easier and in short, their lives are a little happier.\nSuzanne Rohan is not only a master at building business friendships.\nShe's also a master at coaching others to build them.\nI have watched Susan work a room and been amazed at the many ways she finds\nto generate pleasant conversation, show an interest, excuse me, oh boy.\nI have watched Susan work a room and been amazed at the many ways she finds to generate pleasant conversation,\nshow an interest in others and develop affinity and contracts with people,\neven when their points of common interest are not immediately evident.\nShe has been speaking and conducting her seminar on contacts, connections and cocktails,\nhow to work a room for seven years and has worked with tens of thousands of people.\nHer articles have been published in magazines, newspapers and professional journals.\nThis book will serve you well. It will show you how to overcome shyness or awkwardness\nwhen meeting new people and how to change strangers into friends that haven't met yet.\nIt will also give you the tools and confidence to expand these initial contacts\ninto personal and professional friendships that can enrich your business and your life.\nI congratulate you on selecting this book. I assure you that it will be pleasant reading\nand make meeting new people a source of greater pleasure and satisfaction for you and for them.\nOkay.\n\n\n====== REC004.txt ======\nIntroductions. You can tell, you can tell by the feel of the envelope that it's an invitation to something in your right.\nOne of your clients is the honorary chairperson for a local charity and they are throwing a huge fundraiser into weeks.\nNot only should you go, but many potential clients will be there and it's a chance to meet people and promote your business.\nSounds like fun, but before you even have a chance to think about what you're wearing, a little voice in the back of your head pipes up.\nWait a minute, you're walking to that enormous ballroom and seeing thousands of strangers. They'll all know one another, but no one will know you.\nWho will you talk to? What will you say?\nYour teeth will start to grind and your gingerly place, you gingerly place the invitation and your wait to see file.\nYou are not alone. This scenario happens daily in offices and homes across the country.\nIt doesn't matter whether the invitation is for a purely social event, a business gathering, or a combination of the two.\nIt's uncomfortable to walk into a room full of people you don't know, especially when you want to make a good impression.\nIt's also one of the best business and social opportunities you'll ever run across.\nThe benefits of being able to work a room with ease and grace are enormous.\nYou'll feel better by yourself, okay, in one note here. You'll feel better by yourself.\nYou approach a business or social gatherings with enthusiasm and confidence, knowing that this is an arena where you feel comfortable and productive.\nYes, you make invaluable business contacts.\nMost fucking ads, dude, sucks.\n\n\n====== REC005.txt ======\nNow, it's also one of the best business and social opportunities you'll ever run across.\nThe benefits of being able to work a room with ease and grace are enormous.\nYou'll feel better by yourself.\nYou'll approach business or social gatherings with enthusiasm and confidence, knowing that\nthis is an area where arena, where you feel comfortable and productive.\nYou make invaluable business contacts, as well as starting friendships that may last\nyour whole life.\nIf you hadn't been able to walk up to people, smile, put out your hand and say hi, those\nopportunities might have been lost.\nYou make other people feel more comfortable, which makes them want to know and impossibly\ndo business with you.\nI have written this book with one goal in mind.\nTo give you the confidence and the tools to walk into any room and shine, whether the event\nis social or professional, a meeting, a meeting, party, reunion, PTA committee, or the inaugural\nball, this book is designed to help you manage these events successfully and mingle with ease\nand come away feeling that you have accomplished your own goals and made other people feel good\nin the process.\nEverybody wins.\nThe focus will be on identifying the roadblocks that inhibit us from circulating with ease\nand comfort and eliminating them and then eliminating them.\nFor each roadblock, there is an effective remedy, strengthening confidence and projecting\nthe warmth and sincerity that invites people to open up.\nThe focus will be on identifying the roadblocks that inhibit us from circulating with ease\nand comfort and eliminating them.\nFor each roadblock, there is an effective remedy.\nStrengthening confidence and projecting the warmth and sincerity that invites people to open up.\nPractical tips and strategies for starting conversations.\nEstablishing communication and building rapport with strangers.\nPersonal culture will be of greater importance for economic success in the future, says Nathan\nKeyfits and a lot, and a lot, and a lot, and a lot, professor of sociology, emeritus,\nemeritus, emeritus in Harvard, in American, in American, in American demographics magazine.\nThe most successful people will be those who can communicate best for their people.\nPersonal culture will be of greater importance for economic success in the future.\nIn the 80s and 90s, if actually communicating what you and your business are all about\nis not just a plus, but an essential.\nWorking a room can be your number one marketing strategy.\nIt's some of the best advertising you can get, and it's free.\nAll of us work rooms. If you've ever been to a wedding or a meeting, you've worked the room.\nOr else, coming to a deep appreciation, appreciation of how much easier and more pleasant life would be if you developed this skill.\nPeople in my presentations tell me that the most upsetting thing about these events is that everyone else seems to be completely comfortable.\nIt just isn't so. Most people don't like entering a room full of strangers for any reason.\nA party with strangers is the number one social fear.\nAccording to a study on social anxiety reported in the New York Times December 18th, 1984.\nIt was really pretty recent then, 19th.\nOh, we know.\nIntroduction, I'm so confused.\nSo is this her wedding or is it?\nAnyway, in the 80s and 90s, if actively communicating what you and your business are all about is not just a plus, but an essential.\nWorking a room can be your number one marketing strategy. If some of the best advertising you can get, and it's free.\nAll of us work rooms. If you've ever been to a wedding or a meeting, you've worked the room.\nOr else, come to a deep appreciation of how much easier and more pleasant life would be if you developed this skill.\nPeople in my presentations tell me that the most upsetting thing about these events is that everyone else seems to be completely comfortable.\nIt just isn't so. Most people don't like entering a room full of strangers for any reason.\nA party with strangers is the number one social fear.\nIt is the number one social fear, according to a study on social anxiety reported in the New York Times December 18th, 1984.\nMost of us would rather speak in public.\nInteresting. Fear number two, that attend an event with people we don't know.\nVery interesting. So I think I've overcome the first one, but sorry, the latter one.\nIn my program, 90% of the participants admit that they are not comfortable at events where they don't know a good number of people.\nWhen I pull only those involved in sales and marketing, presumably one of the most outgoing groups anywhere.\nThis figure only drops to 80%.\nLess than in my programs, of the participants, of the participants admit that they are not comfortable at events where they don't know a good number of people.\nIn my programs, 90% of the participants admit that they are not comfortable at events where they don't know a good number of people.\nWhen I pull only those involved in sales and marketing, presumably one of the most outgoing groups anywhere.\nThis figure only drops to 80%.\nLess than 0.025%, say they actually enjoy walking into room full of strangers.\nResearch shows that 40% of all adults have social anxiety, according to a New York Times report on research by Dr. Bella DiPolo, a psychologist at the University of Virginia.\nPeople often can't judge how they impress others.\nPeople often can't judge how they impress others.\nJune 30, 1997, at a party with strangers, 75% of adult experience anxiety.\nWhat the fuck?\nDo that's crazy.\nSo if you're uncomfortable with a client's invitation to the charity fundraiser, or your first meeting of a professional association, or when a colleague invites you to the professional, invite you to the rotary, or when your spouse adjusts you come along to the trade show, or when you get the notice of your 20th high school union, even alone.\nIn fact, you're in a very good company.\nIt might even be said that if you didn't have some anxiety, if you didn't have some anxiety, you would not be normal.\nMost of us want to feel comfortable with other people, even strangers, and we'll do whatever it takes to minimize the anxiety and move through a crowded room with ease and grace.\nWe want to be comfortable and to make other people feel comfortable.\nWe want to manage the mingling so that we have fun, so that we have fun, feel good about ourselves, score some professional points, and feel that even putting in an appearance is a good use of our time.\nThis book is for anyone who has to attend events, parties, meetings, conventions, trade shows, fundraisers, cocktail hours, business meetings, professional dinners, reunions, political gatherings, social events, social evenings, etc.\nThe emphasis would be on business, but the principles hold true for any event and for any age group.\nThis book is for anyone who wants to feel more comfortable in a room.\nWorking a room is an old political phrase that conjures up images of overweight men in smoky back rooms, pressing flesh and cutting deals.\nThat's not what we mean today.\nWhen I talk about working a room, I mean the ability to circulate comfortably and graciously through a gathering of meat people, meeting, greeting, and talking with as many of them as you wish.\nCreating communication that is warm and sincere, establishing an honest rapport upon which you can build a friendship, and knowing how to start, how to continue and end a lively and interesting conversation.\nThere is nothing calculated nor manipulative about working a room.\nIf you don't really care about people, if you're warmth, your openness, and your desire to connect with them are not genuine, then no technique in the world will help.\nPeople sense the truth. They usually know when they are being manipulated.\nThey also know when you are making a sincere effort to extend yourself to them, and they appreciate it.\nMy guideline is, go to have fun and enjoy the people. The professional benefits will follow, but go.\nInteresting.\nWorking a room is a risk. No doubt about it. Our egos are on the line, and that can be intimidating.\nIt can be tremendous rewarding on both the personal and professional level.\nThis book is about understanding what keeps us from approaching these events with ease and enthusiasm, and about what we can do to make them comfortable, pleasant, profitable, and even fun.\nIt's about giving ourselves permission to work every room we enter, and to reap the benefits, both personal and professional.\nPractice really does make perfect, and I encourage you to read and to attend as many events as you can, and practice the techniques in this book.\nSome will work well, and others may not be right for you.\nBut as Mom always said, it couldn't hurt to try. No one ever died from eating spinach, or from going to a charity fundraiser.\nYou may find that you already know some of the information in this book, or that you have already practiced some of the techniques.\nGood. Let the book serve as a reminder in sharpen your skills as you go along. The more you practice, the better you'll be, and above all, enjoy.\nGet ready.\nChapter 1. The Roblox.\nMother's Dyer Warnings.\n\n\n====== REC006.txt ======\nIf working a room is so much fun and so profitable,\nwhy do our hearts thump, our palms sweat, and our eyes glaze over when we think about it?\nThe answer is that many years ago, we learned certain survival techniques at our mother's knees.\nMom gave us these desires, gave us these dire warnings.\nThese lack of desires, I guess.\nIt's normalized though.\nOne more time.\nThe answer is that many years ago, we learned how the answer is that many years ago,\nwe learned certain survival techniques at our mother's knees.\nMom gave us these dire warnings with best of intentions.\nMom gave us these dire warnings with the best of intentions.\nFor our own good, and everybody agreed that we should heed them.\nThe trouble is that they worked a lot better when we were six years old than they do now when we are 20, 40, 60, or 80.\nAnd we forget to turn them off.\nNow that we are no longer walking home alone from the first grade,\nthese dire warnings have changed from safety barriers into roadblocks that prevent us from mingling comfortably and effectively with other people.\nMom isn't a blame.\nShe was just doing her job to protect us, and we love her for it.\nBut we heard these warnings so often, and perhaps repeated them to our own kids so often,\nthat they began to sound like the truth.\nThere are five major roadblocks to work in a room successfully.\nKnowing where they come from is the first step to letting them go.\nRoadblock 1. Don't talk to strangers.\nThis first roadblock is as American as Apple fucking pie.\nThis first roadblock is American as Apple pie.\nIt is often accompanied by shaking of the index finger.\nIt made sense when our mothers gave it to us, and it made sense when we gave it to our children.\nWe still don't want our children to talk to strangers on the way home from school.\nToday more than ever, but it doesn't make sense when we're selling a product at a trade show,\nbeginning our first day on a new job, attending a formal ball or mingling at a professional association meeting\nwhere contacts and connections are standing six deep around the room.\nYet we often find ourselves standing in the door, paralyzed with that imaginary finger,\nshaking in our faces at the message, and the message, don't talk to strangers,\nflashing across our subconscious.\nSo we don't. It's so we don't.\nBut it doesn't make sense when we're selling our product at a trade show, beginning our first day on a new job,\nattending a formal ball or mingling at a professional association meeting where contacts and connections are standing six deep around the room.\nYet we often find ourselves standing in the door, paralyzed with that imaginary finger,\nshaking in our faces at the message, shaking in our faces, faces, and the message,\ndon't talk to strangers, flashing across our subconscious.\nSo we don't.

He or she only wants one thing. The intercepted pass. Mother may have had a point here.\nMother may have had a point here, but she was probably talking about high school boys in the 1950s.\nlibidos are inclined to cool, at least somewhat, in the passage from the locker room to the boardroom.\nStill, we run the risk, run the risk that our warm, open, friendly manner will be misconstrued as an invitation to liason.\nHe or she only wants one thing, in fact we would say. Mother may have had a point here, but she was probably talking about high school boys in the 1950s.\nlibidos are inclined to cool, at least somewhat, in the passage from the locker room to the boardroom.\nStill, we run the risk that our warm, open, friendly manner will be misconstrued as an invitation to liason.\nWomen are especially vulnerable to this misinterpretation. A touch on the arm that is intended as a simple gesture of understanding can be misconstrued as an indication of sexual interest.\nNevertheless, Mother's warning is a bit extreme. We can't walk around with a notion that every member of the opposite sex is ready to pounce on us at the slightest provocation.\nThat would put us back into high school in the 50s, and for me, at least once was enough.\nI'm so sorry.\nThe expectations and relationships are broken, I couldn't say otherwise to them.\nYou can't say, you can't, or normally you just ask out, and they have an interest in you, then you can have something to go forward on in a abrupt way.\nBut it impede, not having that part, not having the expectation to met.\nIt's in the back burner of my mind to have that relation.\nSo you look for it, you expect it, you would like it, you would appreciate it.\nSee, it would seem to come from that, it would seem to come from easily to other friends.\nNo one would ask a man, no one would ask a man in that way.\nI would love to be asked if someone would find an interest, but they would not.\nSo all you made to is that feared thing of acting exactly in that way.\nWe act to fucking ask.\nHe or she only wants one thing, it's not the one thing.\nIt's still a seeking, which way it sucks.\nYou shouldn't be seeking it, you shouldn't expect it, you should just...\nBut why be lonely when you could just ask?\nOh my god, this doesn't make sense.\n\n\n====== REC010.txt ======\nRisking the roadblocks. These fine roadblocks are part of what stops us from\nmingling, circulating, and working a room. In the next chapter we'll discuss\nspecific remedies for each roadblock, but there is something else that can\nstop us from moving comfortably around a room. Something more subtle than\nthe five particular roadblocks we've just discussed. It has to do with\nself-perception, self-confidence, and self-esteem. People who register low\non low in these areas can talk themselves out of meeting people and\nfeeling at ease talking to them. In talking to yourself, Dr. Pamela Butler\ndeals with the concept of self-talk, really, really! Not literally though, these\ninternalized, interimaginable things, I think. Self-talk is in your head, I believe.\nThat's my intuition to it. I don't think she talked about siliquity, that's too\ncrazed. In talking to yourself, Dr. Pamela Butler deals with the concept of\nself-talk. These are the things we say to ourselves in our minds. She didn't\nsee it. You can say it to yourself, too, literally. You don't say in your mind, you\nsay in your mind, it cycles and cycles and cycles and cycles and cycles. If you\nsay it aloud, then suddenly it stops cycling and it's like, oh yeah, I have it\nepiphany, that's the thing I want to do. So literally talk to yourself, just talk\nto yourself. These are the things we say to ourselves in our minds, sometimes\neven without being aware that we are saying them. Self-talk can either be positive\nor negative. Dr. Butler says that we can change negative self-talk to positive\nself-talk, and this transformation can have benefits in all areas of our lives.\nHere is some of the negative self-talk that might come up when you think of\nworking in a room. I've always had trouble meeting people. It's just the way I\nam. I don't have anything important or interesting to say. I'll just\nembarrass myself. Better to keep quiet and be cool. Why would anyone want to\nlisten to me? All these people have more important things to do.

good, it's a little sad to leave the old house, even when\nwe're moving into a much nicer one.\nEven when we're moving into a much nicer one.\nWe leave behind the old, familiar, ways and step into new ground.\nA step onto new ground.\nA step onto new ground.\nNo matter how unwonderful the change, getting married, expanding your business, moving\nto an exciting new city, switching careers, there is always a certain amount of discomfort.\nFor most of us, working a room is a change.\nBut extending ourselves to people is almost always worth it, worth the risk.\nWhen we try to succeed, it feels like a million dollars.\nBut when we allow a negative self-talk to prevail, we can talk ourselves out of taking\na risk and become overwhelmed by the roblox.\nHow many times have you seen someone who looked vaguely familiar, but were afraid to go over\nbecause he might not be who you thought he was?\nI say, so what if I am wrong?\nAnd so what if I am wrong?\nThe worst thing that can happen is that he says he is not that person, and I have made\nnew acquaintance, possibly a new friend.\nIn 1981, I attended my first meeting of local professional association.\nOne of the men there looked like a person I met in the previous June at a career training\nconference.\nHe was standing alone at the bar.\nSeveral questions raced through my mind when I saw him.\nWhat if he wasn't that man I met, but just to look alike?\nWhat do you think I was coming on to him?\nOn the other hand, what if he really was the person I met and felt slighted that I didn't\nrecognize him?\nShould I go up and say hello, should I go up and say hello, or wait for him to come to\nme?\nOf all these possibilities, I decided that the worst result would be he was the person I\nmet and thought I was ignoring him.\nMy value system, my value system, which includes more than a mild dose of guilt, took over.\nI approached Ferrell Chiles, Ferrell Chiles and mentioned the June conference.\nHe was not the person I met, but we had a pleasant conversation.\nWe had been following the careers series and in the San Francisco examiner, and remembered\nseveral of my columns, wow, that made me feel terrific.\nI was very glad that it overcome my reluctance to approach him.\nThe benefits have been immeasurable, the benefits have been immeasurable, we play significant\nroles in each other's networks, and we are friends, damn.\nWe tell the story of a unique mirror's first meeting and always pay tribute to that great\nold line.\nDon't I know you from someplace?\nThat's incredible, dude.\nMany of my colleagues, there's got to be a word for that, though.\nMany of my colleagues attend business social sponsored by local chambers or commerce.\nThese are tatted as an opportunity to meet other single people in a setting with some\nprop priority.\nAt one mixer, a friend of a woman who intrigued himself, who intrigued him, he watched her\ntalking, laughing, and enjoying herself.\nI really wanted to meet her, he said.\nI really wanted to meet her, he said.\nShe appeared to be so warm and positive, and she had a great laugh.\nAll that came to mind were those self-critical comments that convinced me that she wouldn't\nlike me.\nI never even introduced myself.\nWhat a loss.\nAnother associate had a happier experience.\nAt a holiday party, she decided to go for it, and asked one of the men she'd met to dance.\nDebra, named change to protect the innocent, had hoped for a more romantic outcome.\nThen an exchange of business cards, but that was not the case.\nShe told me that she was disappointed, but also congratulated herself for having the courage\nto risk rejection.\nShe practiced a new behavior, and she survived.\nDebra, who thinks of herself as shy, knows that next time it would be easier, corralling\nyour courage, no one can give you the courage to introduce yourself to a stranger.\nBut some people are more supportive of that behavior than others.\nMy advice, stick with those who encourage you to take the initiative, my advice, wow.\nNo one can give you the courage to introduce yourself to a stranger, but some people are\nmore supportive of that behavior than others.\nMy advice, stick with those who encourage you to take the initiative.\nSean, you didn't fear at all, and talking to that audience, you just got up and said\nthe thing you wanted to do, that is legendary in my mind, legendary, corralling your courage.\nYou had no courage to bear, it was just like nature.\nOne way to muster up the courage to take a risk, you didn't see as a risk.\nOne way to muster up the courage, it was nonchalant.\nOne way to muster up the courage to take the courage to take a risk is to ask yourself,\nwhat's the worst that can happen?\nSurprisingly enough, your worst fear is usually not a matter of life and death, and the odds\nare that that disaster will not occur, and then even if it does, you will survive.\nTaking the risk is almost always worth it as comfort, it's a cliche, but nothing ventured\nnothing gained.\nAt least some Miller, a travel, a travel pan planner in the Marin, Marin County, north\nof San Francisco, said to me at an event, I realized that the worst possible thing would\nbe that someone wouldn't like me or would laugh at me.\nAnd so what?\nOf all the other people here, someone will like me, understanding that gave me confidence\nto keep trying, and now it is more fun than it is work.\nReminders, mothers dire warnings, reminders, mothers dire warnings, still work in our sub-conscious.\nThese five roadblocks can prevent us from making the most of a party or a business event.\nIt is...\nOkay, you gotta subdued these reminders.\nDon't talk to strangers, wait to be properly introduced.\nGood things come to those who wait, better safe than sorry.\nHe or she only wants one thing.\nBe intercepted pass.\nBe aware of negative self-talk, and change it into positive self-talk.\nExtending yourself to people feels risky, but the benefits are well worth the discomfort.\nChapter 2.\nThe Remedies.\nRemoving the roadblocks.\nNow for the good news.\nFor every roadblock, there is a remedy.\nMembers dire warnings can stop us at any time, unless we apply the appropriate remedy,\nunless we apply the appropriate remedy.\nRemedy 1.\nRedefine the term stranger.\nMom says not to talk to strangers.\nOkay, let's redefine the term.\nObviously, we have to exercise some caution in today's society.\nNot every street corner in town is a suitable place to mix and mingle, and there will always\nbe some people who, for some inexplicable reason, make you feel very uneasy.\nGo with your gut reaction.\nTo be as gut, well, as you're saying, dude, there was legitimate reason for you to fear.\nYou had to fall, you got reaction, you got reaction saved, you and your brother.\nThose people looked like they could have been dangerous.\nIn your description, they were saying, that was terrifying, man, one of your traumatized\nwomen.\nTen years old, and you're running with adults.\nThey have knives.\nAin't knife.\nYou see a glint.\nYou knew that's it.\nYour brain is like on fire to escape.\nTell your brother to run and you take different directions.\nBut if you are attending a meeting or a professional colleagues, you're not really with strangers.\nIf you go to a PTA meeting, you may not know anyone in the room, but you all have a common\ninterest in quality education for your children.\nWhen you go to a new health club, a new church, a new synagogue, a new charitable political\norganization, you have a common interest with those people.\nYou know, interesting, very interesting.\nWhen you go to a party, you probably know the host or hostess.\nAt a wedding, you have some connection with the bride or groom.\nAt a baseball game, notice how everyone talks to everyone else who is rooting for the same\nteam.\nLook for what you have in common with people at an event.\nThis is the planning that helps you feel more comfortable and more prepared.\nYou share interest with anyone who does the same kind of work with you.\nLike you do, who is interested in your work or whose work interests you.\nYou share interest with anyone who does the same kind of work you do.\nWho is interested in your work or who is interested in your work?\nPeople who sell respirators, perform surgery, repair medical equipment, and process insurance\nhave common calligraphy, calligraphy, calligraphy, calligraphy, calligraphy band.\nThey all deal with hospitals.\nIf you volunteer for the local United Way, local United Way, March of Dimes or Public\nRadio Station, you have a common interest both with other volunteers and with people\nwho volunteer for the organizations.\nPeople who have children have a common bond.\nWhether they are construction engineers, musicians, used car salesmen, or company presidents.\nThese common interests can be the basis for conversation, understanding what we have\nin common with them, with others, takes the edge off our reluctance to approach them\nas strangers.\nA friend of mine attended a formal fundraiser for his son's school, and in talking with\nanother father, whom he knew from Little League, discovered that the other dad did\nexactly the executive search.\nAnd happy coincidence, since my friend was planning a career change.\nYeah, this stuff is mundane as shit.\nIt's almost 2 o'clock.\nNow, these common interests, these common interests can be the basis for conversation.\nUnderstanding what we have in common with others takes the edge off our reluctance to approach\nthem as strangers.\nA friend of mine attending a formal fundraiser for his son's school, for his son's school,\nand in talking with another father, whom he knew from Little League, discovered.\nUse common sense when approaching people you don't know, but loosen up with a definition\nof stranger, so that mother's dire warning doesn't keep you from establishing contacts\nand communication.\nWhether you're at a charity or awards banquet, or a spouse's company dinner dance, or your\nchild's soccer team playoffs, identifying the common ground can help you break the ice.\nYou will feel more comfortable, and that will be your reward for changing behavior and\nbreaking through a roadblock.\nFor many two, practice a self-introduction.\nScarlett O'Hara may have needed a proper introduction, but we live in a different world.\nWe may never meet another living soul, okay, I'm tired of this, I was good, but I'll\nget back to it.\nIt's good, it's good, it's all good, it's very

REC014.txt ======\n\n\n====== REC015.txt ======\nSo we got to start the enact, the enact, the enact dialogue system written in reference\nto projects, autumn, autumn, natures, fortune, and doda could be under our home.\nLast update?\nThe beginning is to the description.\nYeah, boy.\nI don't even read that shit.\nYeah, the dialogue system has been in my life for all of seven years, and it is in this document\nthat I would finally compound.\nI would finally compound on all my insights and all my supposed insights and instill you\nwith a model for how it's meant to operate the games.\nAnd an act is an abstraction.\nIt's an abstraction of a real world, relational abilities, and each of these twelve plus two\nsymbols conveys a broad type of emotion, expression, and response values in variables in our behavior\ntoo.\nWhat do you call it?\nThe system's weighted responses.\nWe didn't weighted expressions.\nThe expressions were internal and external and it's okay.\nThe symbols are extracted to it in a way.\nIt's relevant to how false and not damn it.\nMyersberg's bullshit.\nMyersberg's bullshit and astrology is bullshit.\nAnd this thing, if used wrongly, I've seen wrongly, would also be bullshit.\nBecause emotions go in so much more variation than these simple expressions.\nSo, the thing of want and take.\nThe thing of return.\nOkay, the one thing of want and take.\nSeeking to have something.\nSo, there's distinction there.\nAnd there's return and give.\nReturn and give.\nSeeking to have something back.\nOr have something in this.\nAnd that's the thing that had it.\nReturn.\nReturn.\nWanting.\nBelieving good.\nWhat do you say in that?\nReturn and give.\nThe thing of reactivating itself.\nThe activates.\nThe activates.\nSeeking to have something back.\nI shouldn't give a description of that.\nIt's too complex to put it.\nI mean, that one is.\nDumbass.\nOkay, want and take.\nReturn and give.\nAnxiety fear.\nOkay, the feeling of unease.\nUnease or worry.\nThe anxiety or fear.\nIt's too simple.\nToo simple.\nElation sorrow.\nElation.\nI'm sorry.\nElation.\nSo, I'm too.\nThe feeling of pleasure or happiness.\nMisery.\nA reaped of.\nThe feeling of pain or sadness.\nEmpathy.\nThe ability to see a...\nI see likeness.\nAnd then to regard.\nOr love others.\nEnemity.\nEnemity.\nThe ability to see likeness.\nAnd then to blame for hate others.\nBlame hate or disparage or distance.\nOr enmity is the thing of this relation.\nThe thing of gain pride.\nThe feeling of having something.\nThe feeling of having something.\nOr being given to.\nOr for.\nOr for.\nGain or pride.\nThe feeling of having something.\nOr not.\nNo.\nThe feeling of gaining something.\nOf being turned to.\nOf being.\nHaving satisfaction.\nThe thing of being given to.\nOr seeing that the thing of wanting.\nOr taking is.\nIs fulfilled.\nSo this goes more complexity.\nI can't put a miss that in here.\nSo there's expressions, but there's more to it than anyone.\nThe inactive response.\nAnd the inactive having.\nOr principle.\nSo there's the thing of wanting.\nThere's also the thing of having.\nAnd that thing is very interesting.\nI'll get to it.\nBut.\nSo the thing of gain pride.\nThe feeling of loss.\nShame.\nGuilt.\nThe feeling of being stolen from.\nLost from oneself.\nOr a more.\nResponse.\nA build-up of not using.\nThe thing of wanting or take.\nOr return.\nGive actions.\nSo response.\nOften.\nIt might go in way of.\nIn the extreme.\nIt might go in the way of progression.\nBut it goes.\nIt goes in way of automated response.\nBut.\nSorry, that's bullshit.\nIf you want to interrupt someone.\nIf you're feeling like.\nOkay.\nOr.\nSurprise.\nOr.\nThere was more to it than anyone.\nLet me show you the thing.\nBecause it's more and less important.\nSo loss.\nLost shame, guilt.\nResponse.\nBalance.\nAnd then depression.\nSo balance and depression.\nBut other plus two symbols.\nBecause those are not exactly

If you disrepresent yourself in that way, you are doing literally harm to your body in a way that is not so physically represented.\nYou might say you are fine, but there are factors you could use to discern how this person is doing and they would not be doing as well as someone that is well socialized.\nBalance.\nOkay, but if we are not treated fairly, it can lead to negative emotions such as maybe depression and enmity,\nas well as internalized pain from repressed self-expression. This is complicated, I think I am not saying it right.\nThis can manifest physically in symptoms like headaches and migraines, I think.\nThese things are not entrusted to small stuff. You are not exercising well enough. You are not doing enough water.\nYou are not getting your vitamins. Those smaller attributes are falsely attributed to things that are really caused by larger causes of factors that bring us to socialized behavior.\nIf we are not self-expression enough, if we were to hold too much, I have never experienced this pain because I can speak on my own as well as I could.\nSome people are not so unable to speak as they might. They would withhold more and more. The difficulty of expression goes, you want best for other people, but then you would hurt yourself in a way.\nBy withholding thought to one's own. There is difficulty there in how we are describing it.\nIt is not limited. It is not limited. It is doing great.\nThere is Western science and there is Eastern science. We have the strict separation. There is philosophy and there is rhetoric.\nIt is not so separate.

awesome, holy shit, that's what it's come from,\nthat was so awesome dude, I wish I could play, fuck.\n\n\n====== REC030.txt ======\nThis is a book, this is a book I would only feel not to recommend.\nIt's a book on the human nature and the need for social connection and it's titled loneliness.\nThe writing of this book was a collaboration involving two authors and a valuable form of social connection.\nThe only one was a participant in more than 20 years of scientific research.\nThis is the foundation of the story.\nFor the sake of convenience and clarity, we choose the first person to say that we've got little patience to it.\nThe writing of this book was a use system.\nI have to know the language.\nYou can't always know it.\nYou can't do the entire book. Read it with elegance and maybe it's useful.\nYou have practice to calm the fuck down.\nThe writing of this book was a collaboration involving two authors and a valuable form of social connection.\nThe only one was participant in more than 20 years of scientific research.\nThis is the foundation of the story.\nFor the sake of convenience and clarity, we choose to write in the first person singular with John Cassiopo as the narrative voice.\nThat's interesting, that's very interesting.\nYou've forgotten the thing of the author.\nThat's cool too.\nI like that.\nWe employ that convention in these knowledgements as well.\nEven the research that I read, John Cassiopo, what do you mean?\nConducted was never a solo effort.\nThat research on social connection began in the early 1990s at Ohio State University where I thought,\nwe, my assigned to colleagues and I, began with a simple question of what are the effects of human association?\nWhat are the effects of human association?\nTo address this question, we first conducted experiments and which individuals randomly assigned to be alone or with others of various kinds.\nThat's cool.\nEG frangers, friends, friends, strangers, while performing a task.\nWe quickly surmised that it was an individual's perception of the social situation that mattered most.\nWe moved from an interest in social support to a human interest in perceived social isolation.\nLoneliness has a model system for studying the role of the social world in human biology and behavior.\nDoing so changed how we can see the human line as

capacities.\nOur studies of loneliness, let us see them.\nI left us unsatisfied with this metaphor.\nComputers today are massively interconnected devices with capacities that extend far beyond the resident hardware and software for a solitary computer.\nIt became apparent to us that the telereceptors, EG, eyes, ears of the human brain have provided the sitting entire body, all the all the all the demanding parts that bring it.\nThe brain is so so so you could probably map the brain out of the body.\nWe used to have a pictures of the of the human key life.\nBut it goes almost directly to that.\nThe brain goes on our brain because our bodies are so complex.\nAnd because our bodies in these interesting social buildings, social foundations that we built on, like whales and dolphins have.\nAnd so I have elephants.\nWe built them more foundationally than interesting.\nNo, no, because it's different adaptations.\nThere's no certain, but these ones we could maybe communicate, tune to communication.\nIf there's noise to it, whales are playing with orchids.\nNot with orchids, dammit.\nHow could you forget that?\nOh my god.\nThere's one species we think we communicate to.\nThey have five syllables, five expressions that it dammit.\nIt's like almost like more themes.\nMore themes are sentence structure.\nYou have five things, five words.\nYou have five clicks in a given section.\nAnd there's like a break in it.\nIt's more complex than maybe even more code.\nBut the chat GBD recently has found a way to map on a model using non-model.\nIf they give you that information, they give you that context.\nThen they can take a model of this strange communication.\nWhether it's for food, whether it's for just acknowledgment,\nwhether it's for some sort of tail of distance, whatever behavior you imagine.\nThese wonderful creatures have developed themselves over the millennia.\nAnd these models can reflect.\nActually, sorry.\nThey can...\nOh god.\nImagine how do you explain this shit?\nThe model that these machines would generate is reflective.\nI used the word again.\nThe models these machines would generate.\nThese models are...\nOh god.\nThanks man.\nOh, I

reproduce.\nFeelings of loneliness told them when those protective bonds were endangered or deficient.\nIn the same way that physical pain serves as a prompt to change behavior, the pain of\nthe

humans.\nAntide reached a rate, I started to practice dude.\nYou got to read books perfectly.\nYou can't have fucking flaws to it.\nIf you're going to be a public statement like that you can't.\nIt's

to be, I used beautiful language, I liked it.\nBut to be absolutely transparent, to be, to be, to be, to be okay, yeah, to look okay.\nThe good corporation to fucking, if we're making any amount of money to do projects then I think I think it would be, I'd be very open about where it goes.\nWe would put our things, the towards things that are useful to us and we'll keep us, keep us in good care.\nSo all the people that would think to contribute, I would make sure that they are well, well, well undone.\nSo whatever we make, whatever we need, sorry, whatever we dammit, whatever we make, whatever they need.\nWe would, I want to enable anyone to everything they would need.\nAnd we'll take the projects.\nIf, if, if these rhetorical machines, if these rhetorical machines are so

useful.\nPhysical pain protects the individual from physical taintures.\nI reckon recognition of it, say.\nSocial pain, also known as knowing this, evolved for a similar reason.\nBecause it protected

behavior.\nThe pain of burning skin tells you to pull your finger away from the frying pan,\nloneliness developed from a stimulus to get humans to pay more attention to their social connections,\nand to reach out towards others to renew freighter or social bonds.\nBut here was a pain that prompted us to behave in ways that didn't always serve our immediate individual self-interest.\nHere was a pain that got us outside ourselves,\nwidening our frame of reference beyond that moment.\nIn English, we have a word for pain, a word for pain and word for thirst,\nbut no single specific terms that made the opposite.\nWe merely refer the absence of these aversive conditions, which makes sense,\nbecause their absence is considered part of the normal state.\nOur research suggests that, not lonely,\nour research suggests that the thing of in quotation marks here,\nthe thing of not lonely, there is no better,\nmore specific term for it, is also like not thirsty or not in pain.\nInteresting.\nI've read this before, but it's been a long time.\nVery much.\nI'm going to copy it from that now this time, this time around,\nbecause I have different knowledge directly inside

specific term, terms that, why, why did that pop up?\nThat's so strange.\nI said to find out I'm fine earlier.\nAnd I mean the opposite, we really, there is no better, not thirsty, not in pain, very\nmuch of the normal state.\nHealth and well-being for a member of this, health and well-being for a member of our species\nrequires, among other things, being satisfied and secure in our bonds with other people.\nA condition of not being lonely, that for one of a better word, we call social connection.\nAnd this idea of loneliness as, as, as social pain is more than a metaphor, but more than\na metaphor.\nA functional magnetic resonance imaging, FMRI, shows us that, that the emotional region\nof the brain that is activated when we experience rejection is, in fact, the same region.\nThe dorsal anterior singulate, that registers emotional responses to physical pain.\nThe discovery that, that, that feelings of social, social rejection, isolation and\nrejections to physical pain, shared the same hardware, begins to suggest, suggest why.\nBecause loneliness becomes chronic, you cannot escape it merely by coming out of your shell,\nmerely by coming out of your shell, losing weight, getting a fashion makeover, or meeting,\nor, or, or, or, or, or meeting, mister or miss, miss is right, nice, wow, I didn't, I was\nblind to the text, first of my side, I, that would, that would have been helping out so\nmuch, oh my god, yeah, the pain of loneliness is, the pain of loneliness is, the pain of\nloneliness is, is, is, is, is, is a deeply destructive heart, heart, a deeply destructive\nheart will work to the, but it is a deeply destructive heart, heart, the, the, the, the\ndestruction, both both both both both physiological, physiological and behavioral, can turn, turn\nan unmet, and, turn an unmet need for connection, into, into a chronic condition, and when\nit does, changing things for the betterment, for, for, for the betterment, requires taking\ninto account the full depth, and complexity of the role, role loneliness plays in our biology,\nin, in our, and in our evolutionary history, following Katie Bishop's, lead, and trying\nto make ourselves better, make ourselves better, and we, with, with fatty foods, uh, dammit.\nHuh, dammit.\nFollowing Katie, Katie Bishop's, uh, lead, this is, this is the thing of memory dude, why\nit's so broken from me.\nI, I, I should have remembered Katie Bishop, um, now following Katie, following,\nfollowing Katie Bishop, B, Bishops lead following, following, Katie, Katie Bishop's lead,\nand trying to make,

important.\nWe're together to try and understand the links between our psychological responses\nand our social and even spiritual strivings.\nGood text.\nBringing together researchers from so many diverse fields has enabled us to look closely at each piece of the puzzle,\nbut also to step back and consider the big picture in an integrated way.\nSome of my colleagues have taken brain scanning beyond the pathway for pain.\nTo identify the specific, the specific is the path again.\nThe specific brain regions involved in empathy.\nOther humans or even pictures of humans.\nOkay, wait.\nYeah.\nOther studies relying on FMI, FMI, show us that when humans see other humans or even pictures of other humans\nour brains respond in a way that is different from when we see most other types of objects.\nInterestingly, pet owners who really love their animals will show a glimmer of this brain response\nwhen shown a picture of a dog or cat and images of humans.\nThis could do them.\nBuddy, I gotta show you love it some ways.\nYou take it here yourself.\nYou listen right now, you hear me right now, but you don't look at me.\nYou don't look at me.\nYou gotta look at the

way for me.\nIt's a substitute.\nIt's been a substitute for a very long time.\nThis is like talking to the duck.\nBut it's awful.\nTalking to the duck and programming.\nIt is still a liquid in another

identifying the potential benefits.\nBut in the end, what gets us through the night is the dynamic duo of charm and chutzpah.\nI can hear it now, charm and chutzpah in the same breath.\nThey're not a contradiction in terms of behaviors.\nThey're a contradiction in terms of behaviors, not true.\nChutzpah, I look at the courage to converse.\nThe old negative connotations of chutzpah are goal, nerve, a brazeness, brazeness, braziness, braziness that is intrusive and offensive.\nTo me, chutzpah is not aggression, rudeness, disrespect, or bulldozing.\nIt is simply the courage to take risks.\nChutzpah allows us to make the first ice-breaking comment that opens the doors to conversation.\nIt gives us the courage to walk into the party, fundraiser, aerobics class, or meeting.\nTake a deep breath, introduce our intranet and introduce ourselves to someone, and introduce ourselves to someone.\nCan it help you work a room?\nWhat else is working a room?\nWould you wish on your children?\nYou bet.\nThey will be ahead of the game when they start working rooms, and they will.\nChutzpah is the cornerstone of confidence.\nChutzpah is the cornerstone of confidence.\nIn the 1980s, Chutzpah had been elevated to the status of a management tool.\nIn getting Chutzpah, having November 1992, psychologist Elliott Jaffa identified Chutzpah as an overlooked, personal quality that makes a successful manager.\nJaffa says that Chutzpah allows us to risk rejection.\nRisk rejection asks for what we want and express ourselves.\nIt gives us the strength to pick ourselves up, and start all over again.\nCharm.\nCharm, you and the Queen mum.\nHere is what Webster has to say about charm.\nIt's a verb to captivate, delight, attract, please.\nAs a noun, a power to gain affection.\nThese definitions make most people shout.\nWhere do I sign up?\nIn charm school, I was taught how to dress, walk, apply, apply makeup, smile, behave, and be well-mannered.\nThese things are important, she says, but charm includes something more.\nAn elusive quality which draws us to people and makes us believe they care about us.\nIt's easier to define charm in terms of who has it and who does not.\nPresident Nixon doesn't have it. President Reagan does.\nMike Dittka doesn't have it. Sugar Ray Leonard does.\nBetty Davis doesn't have it. Helen Hayes does.\nI don't know who those are, but okay.\nCharm is a combination of warmth, good nature, positive attitude, a good sense of humor, charisma, spirit, energy, and an interest in others.\nMy friend and associate, Cheris Sputuin has it.\nWhen she own the fame mansion in, every guest felt welcomed.\nPeople want to be around her.\nCharm is the ability to convey a type of caring that comes from the heart and soul.\nAn advice colonist wants to find class as the ability to make people of all walks of life feel comfortable.\nClass isn't that thing.\nShirt's fun charm, if you have class.\nTo me, the definition also applies to Charm.\nCharm and Shirt's fun.\nThe person who personifies Charm for me is the queen mother.\nQueen Elizabeth's second mother, Robert Lacey, author of Queen Mother, described her on the today show as having the gift of making you feel she's been waiting all week to meet you.\nI would not interest him.\nThat truly is a gift.\nThe art of conveying interest, concern, and caring for another person.\nWhen we work a room, a party, a convention, we're a jogging track.\nWe must be keenly aware of other people's feelings.\nIgnoring someone because the title of their name tag doesn't impress us is a cardinal sin.\nWhen we work a room, a party, a convention, or a jogging track, we must be keenly aware of other person's feelings.\nIgnoring someone because the title on their name tag doesn't impress us is a cardinal sin.\nNow, one in one is three.\nWhen Shirt's fun and Charm come together, it's synergistic.\nThe whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\nThe whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\nThe whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\nWhen Shirt's fun and Charm come together, it's synergistic.\nThe whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\nYou don't just have Shirt's fun and Charm, you have magic.\nOne in one is three.\nYou care about other people, and you have the courage to walk up to them and let them know it.\nThat's a powerful combination.\nThat's a powerful combination.\nWhen Shirt's fun and Charm come together, it's synergistic.\nThe whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\nYou don't just have Shirt's fun and Charm, you have magic.\nYou care about people, and you don't have the courage to walk up to them and let them know it.\nThat's a powerful combination, and one that enriches everyone's concern.\nThat's a powerful combination, and one that enriches everyone's concern.\nThe dynamic duo of Shirt's fun and Charm isn't too do or a technique.\nIt's something we all have, and that we've developed to a greater or lesser extent.\nNow is the time to let it out and spread it around.\nThere is no more effective way to work a room to give on that thing.\nReminder. Shirt's fun and Charm are the dynamic duo at the heart of working a room successfully.\nWe all have these qualities. Practice makes them stronger.\nThey let us work a room with style and grace, and ultimately are what attracts people to us.\nThat's a powerful combination, and one that enriches everyone's concern.\nThat's a powerful combination, and one that enriches everyone's concern.\n\n\n====== REC068.txt ======\nChapter 5, Mr. or Mrs. Sleeze, works at room.\nHow not to do it?\nChapter 5, the people who are the most successful at working at room\nare those who genuinely like respect and trust people.\nOkay, try again.\nThe people who are most successful,\nwho are most successful at working at room\nare those who genuinely like respect and trust people.\nWhen we don't really care about people,\nthey sense the insecurity,\ninsincereity, insincereity,\nand really take kindly to it.\nOh, projection.\nOh, try again.\nThe people who are most successful at working at room\nare those who genuinely like respect and trust people.\nWhen we don't really care about people,\nthey sense the insecurity and really take kindly to it.\nOh, try again.\nThe people who are most successful at working at room\nare those who genuinely like respect and trust people.\nReally take kindly to it.\nBeing slimed.\nAnd she says, being slimed in quotation marks\nhad a recent benefit.\nA man who has had a recent benefit.\nHad a recent benefit.\nA man who is involved in this community approached me and told me\nthat he really knew how to work a room\nand had a great deal experience at it.\nknowledgeable, charming, and smooth on the surface.

When he spoke, mostly about himself, his past,\nhis ideas, his successes, his goals, he locked me in his eyes, he locked me in with his eyes\nthat felt like lasers. Like Bill Murray in God, like Bill Murray in Ghostbusters. I felt like\nI'd been slimed. Mr. Sleeze was a user and a loser. Keeping up.\nMr. or Mrs. Sleeze disguises. We've all met the Sleezes at parties, meetings, meetings,\nand conferences. They may wear a thousand dollar briani or channel suits instead of the proverbial\nshark skin. They may look perfectly conservative and stylish. They may even appear to be the\nprince or princess of our personal or professional dreams. They may say all the right things,\nbut you just know they don't really care about you or your career. They almost never\nfollow through with what they promise. Their behavior does not support their words.\nUniversity educator, Ernie Bogg-Martin told a seminar group,\nbehavior that doesn't support words actually subverts them. Behavior that doesn't support words\nactually subverts them. If what we do doesn't support what we say, we are worse off than if we\nhadn't said anything at all. The Sleezes of the world come in many forms. They are male and female,\nyoung, old, and middle-aged, wealthy, and struggling. They can be anyone. They can be anyone.\nThe common denominator. They have no respect for anyone who can't do something for them.\nThey are just trying to make their contact quota, and it shows.\nLearning from Sleeze. Is there a lesson in Mr. or Mrs. Sleeze's behavior?\nYou bet. The technical skills of working a room are not enough. The warmth and desire to help\nmust be genuine and sincere. I hate to sound like grandma, but when in doubt, apply the golden rule.\nTreat other people as you would want to be treated. It's old-fashioned, but it's easy,\nbut it's easy, true, and almost feel safe.\nI say almost feel safe because there are some people, only a few, fortunately, who don't care\nhow we treat them because they don't care about us. They treat everyone with a chilling\ncombination of disregard and disdain. They don't expect anything different from others.\nThey are the roadblock. People who tempt us not to risk rejection.\nAll you can do is apply remedy number four and move on. You've got to have Chutzpah, charm confidence.\nRoadblock number four.\nOh, no, my bad. Roadblock number four is better safe than sorry, risking rejection.\nNo one wants to be rebuffed or ignored.\nOur ego is around the line when we extend ourselves to others because there's always the possibility\nthat they won't be interested in talking with us. But mother's dire warnings that we're better\nsafe than sorry puts a real damper on risk. And risk is the name of the game when you're working a room.\nI like to think of this risk as a challenge. If you don't have anything on the table, you never win.\nIf you don't take the risk and reach out to people, you never make new friends or contacts.\nWe risk our lives at the time, all the time on the freeway. Most of us are strong enough to withstand a temporarily chipped ego.\nThe truth is a very few people will be openly hostile or rude if for no other reason than its bad business.\nSo to risk rejection, so you work up your nerve to approach a stranger, you smile, say hello, introduce yourself.\nThe other person casts you at it, casts you at disinterested glance and screams, who cares.\nThis hurts. No one wants to be rebuffed or ignored.\nOkay, so back to it. No joking matter. Humor that hurts.\nThe jokester who works a room with inappropriate humor has the same effect as insect repellent.\nAn associate who might call Linda attended a business reception when she encountered a local attorney who was\nactive on the organization's education committee. This Mr. Cee's prototype made quite an impression for his offensive sense of humor.\nGary came up to me when I was talking to another woman, woman business owner, Linda told me.\nHe said hello and asked how I was. I hadn't been out, hadn't been to our committee meeting that month due to a severe case of the flu.\nSo when he asked how I was, I said that I was feeling much better. Laughing at his own wit, he replied,\naren't you glad that time, that time of the month is over. The sad thing is, wow, the sad thing is that he actually thought he was funny.\nMy friend and I were so, we're both offended. We simultaneously rolled our eyes and walked away from Mr. Bugs' prey.\nHis idea of humor was insulting, and you can be sure I would never refer any business to him.\nAnd if anyone asked me about him, I would be definitely silent.\nNow, fatal flaws. There is good news and bad news for Mr. and Mrs. Cee's.\nThe good news is that, if being remembered is the goal, they achieve it. People do remember.\nThe bad news is that they are being remembered for all the wrong reasons.\nThe Sleses leave a negative impression, and that really enhances one's social life or business network.\nIn addition to being remembered as an insincere user and an unfailing manipulator,\nMr. and Mrs. Cee's often brings to the meeting or party a whole bag of unpleasant social tricks.\nThese fatal flaws include disparaging or put down humor, one drink too many,\nmonopolizing someone's time, wearing a t-shirt or jeans at a suit and tie event,\nwearing a low-cut, revealing or unfashionably tight dress at a business function,\nmoving around the room with a cigarette or cigar in hand.\nOverloading his or her plate with a buffet and returning too many times.\nEating, drinking, and talking simultaneously.\nSizing people up by the title on their name tag and moving away conspicuously if they\naren't important enough or perceived as a decision-maker.\nPatronizing any individual or group, especially women, the elderly, minorities, or the physical challenge.\nLoudness, the hard sell, not falling through on offers or promises.\nComplaining about the room, the food, the other attendees, etc.\nDon't complain, how to handle a cease, confront them, I think.\nBut as she says, she's that confront them or reject them, maybe.\nBut extricate yourself quickly. There is no reason for you to put up with this kind of behavior,\nnor to waste your time being gracious to someone who doesn't even know or care that you are being\ngracious to them. Trying to be polite, but remember that a sleaze is entirely sensitive to the\ndifferences, difference between polite and impolite. The most important thing is to get away.\nReminders, Mr. or Mrs. Sleeze can chop up anywhere and can come in a variety of disguises.\nYou would recognize them by their uncounty ability to make others uncomfortable,\nby their concentration on themselves rather than on other people,\nby their offensive humor and or behavior, and mostly by their lack of genuine caring or follow-through.\nThe best way to handle a sleaze is to extricate yourself from the situation as quickly as possible\nand to move on to more pleasant company.\nChapter 6. Preparation of planning and presence.\nYou are said to go. You've identified the roadblocks, applied the remedies,\nand seen the specific benefits of working in the room.\nAnd seen the specific benefits of working in the room.\nPolished up your shutzba and your charm and learned to avoid either resembling or spending time\nwith Mr. or Mrs. Sleeze. What's next? Before you rush out into the night or the afternoon\nor the morning, take some time to prepare yourself. The old army saw about the five\npeas. Also holds true for business and social events.\nPrior planning prevents poor performance. Prior planning prevents poor performance.\nBarbara Waltress stresses the importance of preparation and how to say practically\nanything to practically anybody. Unlike some interviewers, she doesn't make do with information\nprovided by the producer or research department. She does her own research and is extensive\nand it is extensive enough that she is almost never taken by surprise.\nShe is, she always prepares more questions.\n\n\n====== REC069.txt

you've done your preparation, but what if your internal\nengine starts to stall with a thought of actually walking in the door.\nThese 7 strategies will give you a quick jumpstart and bring you through the event to a smooth\nstop.\nThrough the event to a smooth stop.\nStrategy 1, the entrance, the entrance, grand or otherwise.\nWhat time should you arrive?\nArrival?\nArrival time is usually based on the starting time of the event, not on making a conspicuous\nentrance.\nThere is no such thing as being fashionably late to a meeting.\nWhen you arrive at the event, take a deep breath, stand tall and walk into the room.\nHanging out in the doorway creates a fire hazard, a traffic problem, and the impression that\nyour timet about coming in.\nThere may or may not be an official greeter, anticipate that there will not be one and enjoy\nthe pleasant surprise if there is.\nSpeaker and author Judith Briles recommends volunteering to be on the greeting committee\nyourself.\nThat way you get to meet everyone because it's your job.\nIf you are shy, this gives you something to say to people right away.\nGive the room a quick one-sover.\nWhere is the bar?\nWhere is the food?\nWhere are people congregating?\nWhere can you position yourself to meet the most people?\nA professional speaker who addresses audiences of thousands once told me he had great difficulty\nattending cocktail parties and talking to people one-on-one.\nHis solution is to position himself between the entry and the buffet table so that everyone\nhas to walk by him to get to the food.\nHe is always surrounded by people.\nThat's clever.\nThat's very clever.\nOnce you are in the room and look around for people you know, look around for people\nyou know.\nIf you see someone who looks vaguely familiar, go up and introduce yourself.\nFind out if that person is who you thought he or she was.\nFind out if that person is who you thought he or she was.\nIt's interesting.\nThere is no point in wondering what would happen if?\nWhat would happen if?\nOne of two things will happen.\nYou will be right and renew the acquaintance or two.\nYou meet a new person.\nChat for a while.\nAnd move on.\nStrategy two.\nThe buddy system.\nIf the thought of entering a room gives you the shakes, try the buddy system.\nAnd make a deal with a friend who must also attend these events and go together.\nBut don't limit your arrangement to having someone with whom to walk in the door.\nThe buddy system can be a great way to work a room.\nIf you do some prior planning and strategizing.\nSo buddy strategies.\nOne of the main advantages to going to an event with a buddy is that you can introduce\none another around.\nYou may know people your buddy doesn't know and vice versa, even if neither of you know anyone.\nYou will both meet people in the course of the event and can introduce each other to\nyour new friends.\nBrush up on your introduction skills so that you present your buddy as a pleasant, interesting\nperson who has something in common with the other attendees.\nThis means listening to people to find out what their interests are.\nGive people enough information about your buddy to begin a conversation.\nThis means listening to people to find out what their interests are.\nGive people enough information about your buddy to begin a conversation.\nAnd use a positive tone of voice.\nTwo.\nMake sure your buddy does the same.\nYour buddy's introduction of you should be as enthusiastic and informative as yours is of him or her.\nI feel to do this once.\nI feel to do this once.\nA colleague and I agreed to promote each other with our introductions.\nMy introduction of her had her one wave short of walking on water.\nBut her enthusiastic introduction of me sounded like a preview of my eulogy.\nIt was deadly.\nDon Hansen, a San Francisco business consultant, says that some people are legitimizers,\nsimply by virtue of who they are and how they introduce other people.\nLegitimizers.\nThey are individuals with a certain amount of status and they know how to present other people to best advantage.\nThree.\nYou and your buddy would want to split up as soon as possible.\nIf you behave like Simon's twins, your ability to walk the room and meet people is limited.\nYou'll meet only half the number of people and those you do meet will think you are joined at the hip.\nFour.\nDevelop a rescue signal so that you and your buddy can regroup to assess and re-strategize.\nAnd help extricate one another from conversations that have gone on too long.\nIt is fantastic.\nOh my god.\n\n\n====== REC071.txt ======\nSo Sean, this is how to work a room. Chapter 7. Seven strategies from jumpstart to smoothstop.\nThere's a section here, I thought it was important.\nThe strategy is to work a room. Your entrance is important, grand or otherwise.\nBut the buddy system, I think you have confidence down, so I don't need to elaborate on that.\nBut the buddy system, the buddy system itself, if the thought of entering a room gives you the shakes, try the buddy system.\nMake a deal with who must also attend these events and go together.\nBut don't limit your arrangement to having someone with whom to walk in the door.\nThe buddy system can be a great way to work a room.\nIf you do some prior planning and strategizing, so buddy strategies.\nOne of the main advantages of going to an event with your buddy is that you can introduce one another around.\nYou may know people, your buddy doesn't know, and vice versa.\nEven if neither of you know anyone, you'll both meet people in the course of the event and can introduce each other to your new friends.\nBrush up on your introduction skills so that you present your buddy as a pleasant, interesting person.\nWho has something in common with the other attendees.\nThis means listening to people to find out what their interests are.\nGive people enough information about your buddy to begin.\nTry to give people enough information about your buddy to begin a conversation and use a positive tone of voice.\nUse a positive tone of voice.\nMake sure your buddy does the same.\nYour buddy's introduction of you should be as enthusiastic and informative as yours is of him or her.\nShe says, I failed to do this once.\nA colleague and I agreed to promote each other with our introductions.\nMy introduction of her had her one wave short of walking on water.\nBut her enthusiastic introduction of me sounded like a preview of my eulogy.\nSound like a preview of my eulogy.\nIt was deadly.\nDon Hansen, a San Francisco business consultant, says that some people are legitimizers.\nSimply by virtue of who they are and how they introduce other people.\nThey are individuals with a certain amount of status and they know how to present other people to best advantage.\nNumber three.\nA junior buddy will want to split up as soon as possible.\nIf you behave like Simon's twins, your buddy to work a room and meet people as limited.\nYou'll meet only half the number of people.\nAnd those you do meet will think you are joined at the hip.\nNumber four.\nI develop a rescue signal so that you and your buddy can regroup to assess and re-strategize.\nAnd help extricate one another from conversations that have gone on too long.\n\n\n====== REC072.txt ======\nNow, stretch number three, the white knuckle, the white knuckle drinker and other accessible\nfolk.\nYou are inside the room and you and your buddy have decided it's time to split up.\nWhere do you turn?\nWhat do you, who do you talk to?\nYou don't recognize a soul and feel conspicuous standing alone.\nThe temptation at this point is to find a place near the wall and try and to look\nlike a paint chip.\nInitiating conversation can be challenging.\nRemember our mothers taught us not to talk to strangers, but we've remedied that.\nWe also fear rejection and perhaps suspect that we are not interesting.\nWe're too attractive enough.\nBut we've reminded those, we've remedied those things too.\nAnd because we are attending this reception in order to work the room,\nwe can't afford to be wallflowers.\nNow, it's time to step out there on our own, work up our courage and do something.\nWhat I do in this situation is look for the white knuckle drinkers.\nIf you want to manage the mingling at any event, look for people who are standing around\nwith white knuckles.\nIt doesn't matter whether their cup or glass contains a drink, wine, coffee or water.\nThey are clutching it so tightly that their knuckles are white.\nAre they scared to death and they are always alone?\nThese people usually welcome you, your conversation, because you save them from anonymity and anonymity.\nNo one else is talking to them.\nIf you walk up and start a conversation, you're doing a good deed and also moving yourself\naway from the wall.\nI'm seized the moment.\nMake eye contact, smile and say hello.\nDon't treat these people as losers.\nIn most cases, they aren't.\nMaybe they are just shy or anxious.\nMake your conversation so fascinating that other people are drawn into your little group\nand expand the circle.\nShe says, Theresee Godfrey, a Hanululu-based consultant and speaker says, when you care about\nother people's comfort more than your own, your clumsiness and self-consciousness go away.\nWell, remember, the white knuckle drinker is more uncomfortable than you are.\nAnd we'll be delighted with practically anything you have to say.\nThat is so good.\n\n\n====== REC073.txt ======\nStrategy number four. Strategy number four. Name tags that pull. While there are still mixed feelings about name tags, they are very important for business and social events, she says.\nThis is old text, but name tags have some obvious benefits. Use them. You can address a person by name, which is always preferable.\nThey provide information you can use to begin conversation. In quotation she has. Company, job, title, location, area of specialty, etc.\nThe value of information is not just your name. In this context it is not just your name. It is information about your profession, about your...\nYou are a negotiated interest. You are a prospective negotiated interest.\nIf you see that from your face, but aren't sure if the person is who you think he or she is, you can sneak a peek at the name tag.\nAt many trade shows, cocktail parties, and other events, name tags are provided. The person's name should be large and bold enough to be visible even if you are standing a few feet away.\nThe company name is often a bit smaller and you have to get closer to read it. Many civic organizations and some churches use name tags to encourage mingling.\nSometimes the name tags are color coded to distinguish members from guests or new members.\nAn unwritten rule is that members seek out guests and new members and make them feel welcome.\nAccording to Rick Enos, a senior member of the guardsman, a San Francisco civic organization.\nYou might take a cue from this rule and make yourself an unofficial greeter of guests and new members.\nFork, it's gonna hot.\n\n\n====== REC074.txt ======\nDiscovering what to say, the problem in previous chapters, we have looked at the process\nof rhetoric and then at each of the main elements in the rhetorical situation.\nThat's so welcome on dude, the problem, in the previous chapters we have looked at the\nprocess of rhetoric and then at each of the main elements in the rhetorical situation.\nContent, he says content, content, audience and persona, persona.\nUnderstanding all these things certainly helps us understand the rhetorical process.\nIt helps us understand and evaluate our own rhetoric as well as the rhetoric of others.\nMoreover, it has given us some suggestions about our own writing.\nFuck, come on dude.\nCenter.\nUnderstanding, understanding all these things, all these things, certainly helps us understand the rhetorical process.\nIt helps us understand and evaluate our own rhetoric as well as the rhetoric of others.\nI'm more over.\nIt has given us some suggestions about our own writing.\nIs it too mixed?\nYeah, dang dude, come on.\nIt just takes me a bit.\nHowever, our central problem is still ahead of us.\nHow do we know what to say and how to say it?\nHow, in a given rhetorical situation, do we decide on the best strategy for achieving our\nrhetorical goal?\nRhetorical goals.\nHow, boy, practice, it's good, and better, but there you go.\nThis problem is the problem of discovery, or as classical rhetoric, rhetoric, rhetoric, rhetoric, rhetoric, rhetorications, rhetorications, often called it invention.\nThis problem is the problem of discovery.\nI'm trying again, that was the fifth interesting.\n\n\n====== REC075.txt ======\nThis chapter in those that follow will attempt to provide a general method for composing and expressing.\nThis chapter will specifically focus specifically specifically focus on how the major elements in the rhetorical situation, content, situation.\nThis chapter will specifically focus on how the major elements in the rhetorical situation, content, audience, persona, interact to produce effective rhetorical writing.\nYou will learn how to consider each in producing and producing a discourse.\n\n\n====== REC076.txt ======\nI can bring it down.\nI have a purpose.\nBefore discussing three major elements in the rhetorical situation, we should probably\nconsider the hidden element in the rhetorical situation.\nThe rhetorical situation, oh boy, it's worse.\nIt's worse.\nI need to work on this.\n\n\n====== REC077.txt ======\nYeah. Discovering what to say. This is on rhetoric, theory and practice for composition.\nWhile the rest is not. Now the problem. In the previous chapters we have looked at the process of rhetoric and then at each of the main elements and the theoretical situation.\nHe says content, audience and persona. Understanding all of all these things certainly helps us understand the rhetorical process. It helps us understand and evaluate our own rhetoric as well as the rhetoric of others. Moreover, it has given us some suggestions about our own writing.\nHowever, our central problem is still ahead of us. How do we know what to do and how to say it?\nWhat to do? What to say and how to say it? How in a given rhetorical situation do we decide on the best strategy for achieving our rhetorical goals?\nThis problem is the problem of discovery or as classical rhetoricians often called it invention. This chapter in those that follow will attempt to provide a general method for composing and expressing.\nThis chapter will specifically focus on how the major elements in the rhetorical situation, content, situation, content, audience, persona interact to produce effective rhetorical writing.\nWe will learn how to consider each in producing a discourse.\nBefore discussing the three major elements in the rhetorical situation, we should probably consider the hidden element in the rhetorical situation.\nThe writer's purpose is a less objective element than the other three. It is often more difficult to identify than content, audience, or persona.\nFor purpose does not exist on paper or in the social framework of the rhetorical situation.\nRather it exists in the mind and the heart of the writer.\nThis may not be clear to the audience or even to the writer himself, though he certainly has some general sense of purpose.\nIt can be considered as really two different purposes. He says an external purpose and an internal purpose.\nIt is so supposed and the framework systemic purpose.\nThe external purpose is the rhetorical goal. What the writer hopes to accomplish in the external or real world.\nThe internal purpose is the rhetorical strategy that the writer uses to achieve his goal.\nIn deliberative rhetoric, the external purpose is some action.\nFor instance, a writer may want you to vote for Jones by a Hershey bar. Stop littering or stop smoking.\nThe writer is trying to get you to stop smoking. He has a wide choice of internal purposes or strategies open to him.\nHe could present extensive evidence on how harmful smoking is to your health. He could attempt to scare you out of smoking by presenting a conversation between a widow and her young children.\nWe are asking her when daddy will be home again. He could present the personal testimony with a smoker who is dying from lung cancer or some other dreadful disease that results from smoking.\nThese are rhetorical expressions.\nIn a judicial theoretical situation, the external purpose is not so much an action as a judgment.\nThe writer wants you to conclude that Ralph King did not kill Harry at Johnson that Leigh F. Erickson did land in North America before Columbus came to the New World.\nThat name should be restricted in history. Or that alien creatures are visiting Earth.\nIn such situations, the internal purpose may be quite close to the external purpose.\nFor instance, if a historian is trying to convince other historians that Leigh F. Erickson came to America before this other dude, his internal purpose will probably be to present evidence of Erickson's visits.\nI hope this other dude didn't do as much damage, but I don't know history.\nThe rest of the difference between the two purposes might seem small. In a courtroom, however, a lawyer might attempt to persuade his audience.\nThe jury, that his client is not guilty by appealing to the jury that his client is not guilty by appealing to their emotions.\nAs comedian Don Adams once asked an old male jury about an attractive woman accused of killing her husband, is that the face of a murderous?\nIs that the figure of a murderous? Are those the legs of a murderous?\nThe important thing for you, as a writer, is to be aware of just when your external purpose is, and then, to decide what,\nthe general approach to strategy will help you achieve, in that purpose.\nGood attempt, but.\nYou're not processing it. You're not processing any of it.\nLet's look at the letter about abortion. The letter that we looked at in chapter 3.\nFunny, but when a woman discovers she's pregnant and is glad, she says she is going to have a baby.\nWhen she doesn't want it, she calls it out, and has it terminated by an abortion.\nYeah, sorry, yeah.

Happiness feels\nintolerably elusive for many of us. Like fog, you can either see it from afar, dense,\nand full of shape, but upon approach, its particles loosen, and suddenly it becomes out of\nreach. You know, even though it's all around you, we put so much emphasis on the pursuit\nof happiness, but if you stop and think about it, to pursue it is to chase something\nwithout a guarantee of ever catching it. A guarantee is without a guarantee of ever catching\nit. Dang it. We put so much emphasis on the pursuit of happiness, but if you stop and\nthink about it, to pursue it, to pursue it is to chase something without a guarantee of\never catching it. Up until about six years ago, I was fervently and inefficiently chasing\nhappiness. My husband, Jim and I, were living in San Jose, California, with our two-year-old\nson and a second baby on the way. The author, our name, Jennifer Moss, Jennifer Moss. On paper,\nour life appeared rosy. Still, I couldn't seem to find joy. I always felt so guilty about\nmy sadness. My problems were embarrassingly first world. First world, she says. Yes, yes,\nyes. We have to recognize that. It is immense privilege. We are so fortunate. We don't recognize\nthis. We tend not to. We cannot. Imagine. Then in September 2009, my first world tilted.\nJim fell severely ill. Her husband. He was diagnosed with swine flu, H1N1, the West Nile virus.\nThen, then Gullian Berry syndrome, due to his compromised immune systems. Jim never\nworried about his death. I did. Well, of course, when we were told Jim's illness was letting\nup, he would put on a face ward. He never worried about it. He lived in the moment. He says\nhe does. And he will. And he did. I'm sure. I think that was a good ending to this. My\nbed. I read it before. We knew that prognosis meant the end of Jim's career as a pro lacrosse\nplayer. What we didn't know was how we'd pay the medical bills or how much energy Jim would\nhave for parenting. With 10 weeks, with 10 weeks to go until the baby arrived, I had very\nlittle time to think and reflect. Jim, on the other hand, only had time. He was used to\nmoving at high speeds, both in life and on the field. So minutes passed like hours in\nthe hospital. He kept busy with physical and occupational therapy, but he was also in\nneed of psychological support. He put out a note to people and his social networks asking\nthem for reading suggestions. They would help him to heal, to mentally heal. Suggestions\nflowed in. Books and audio tapes were delivered besides a bed-delivered bedside, with notes\nabout how they'd helped so much. After whatever difficulty this person had, also experienced\nbut ever came. After whatever difficulty this person had, also experienced but ever came.\nAlso had experience but ever came. Jim would spend his days reading motivational books\nfrom Tony Robbins and Oprah for watching Ted Talks like Jill Bolte Taylor, My Stroke\nof Insight. Jill Bolte Taylor's My Stroke, about the impacts of brain trauma. He would\nanalyze spiritual books by Ted D-Pax Chopra, Deepak Chopra, Chopra, and Dalai Lama. Or review\nside to the research papers about happiness and gratitude. Written by researchers, Martin\nSiegelman, Sean Acker, Sanja Lio Bromsky, and many others. There was a repeated theme\nthroughout all the literature, gratitude. It would grieve in and out of the science, the\ntrue stories and the drivers for his success. Jim responded by starting a gratitude journal\nof his own. He got very thankful, thankful for the people who changed his sheets, thankful\nfor the family that would bring him hot meals at dinner, thankful for the nurse who would\nencourage him, and thankful for the extra attention his rehab team would give him on their\nown time. He was thankful for the nurse, but that's nice. The team once told Jim that\nthey were only putting in extra time because they knew how grateful it was for their efforts.\nHe asked, that's not a good job, dude. He asked that I participate in his approach, and\nbecause I wanted to help him heal. Help him heal so badly, and I was seeing how hard\nit was for him. I tried hard to be in a positive place when I came into his world inside\nthat hospital room. I wasn't always at my best. I sometimes resented that I couldn't\nbreak down, but after a while I started to see how rapidly he was getting better. Although\nour paths were in congruent, we weren't making it work. I was coming around. It was shaky\nand scary, but when Jim walked out of the hospital on crutches, he stubborn and refused\nthe wheelchair, only six weeks after he was rushed by ambulance to the ER. We decided\nthere was something more to his healing than just unlock. One of those early books that\ninfluenced Jim was Seagalman's Flourish. Seagalman's Flourish. A psychologist and former\npresident of the American Psychology Association, Seagalman was responsible for defining the\nterm perma, the root of many positive psychology research projects around the world. The acronym\nstands for the five elements essential to lasting contentment. So positive says positive\nemotion, your peace, peace, gratitude, satisfaction, pleasure, pleasure, inspiration, hope, curiosity,\nlove, love, love, fall into this category, engagement, losing ourselves in a task or project\nprovides us with a sense of disappeared time, because we are so highly engaged. Relationships,\npeople who have meaningful relationships, meaningful positive relationships with others\nare happier than those who do not. Well, that's clear. Meaning. Meaning comes from service,\nsorry, that sucks. Meaning comes from serving a cause bigger than ourselves. Whether it's\nreligion or a cause that helps humanity in some way, we all need meaning in our lives.\nAccomplishment, accomplishment, achievement. To feel significant life satisfaction, we must\nstrive to better ourselves. We slowly brought these five tenants back into our lives. Jim returned\nto Wilfred Lawyer University in Ontario to research neuroscience and we promptly started\nup plasticity labs to help teach others what we learned about the pursuit of happiness. As\nour lives came to include more empathy, gratitude, and our end meaning, I stopped feeling sad. So,\nwhen I see skepticism, skepticism, I directed at the positive psychology movement. I take it personally.\nI do these critics have a problem with gratitude. Relationships, meaning, hope, perhaps\nperhaps most, perhaps part of the problem is that we oversimplify happiness in our pop culture\nand media, which makes it easy to discard and un-discard as improving. As Vanessa Boot, Boot, Boot, Boot,\na postdoctoral fellow in social psychology put it to me in an email. One of the misconceptions\nabout happiness is that happiness is being cheerful, joyous, and content all the time. Always\nhaving a smile on your face. It's not being happy and leading rich lives. It's about taking\nthe good with the bad and learning how to reframe the bread, reframe the bad. In fact, in fact,\nthe recent article in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, Emote-Emote Diversity and the Emotional\nEco-System by Harvard, a researcher, Jody? Jody? Quote branch found that experiencing a wide range of\nemotions, both positive and negative, was linked to the positive, two positive, mental, and physical\nwell-being. Not only do we tend to misunderstand what happiness is, we also tend to chase it the\nwrong way. Sean Anchor, the researcher and corporate trainer who wrote the HBR article,\npositive intelligence, told me that most people think what happiness the wrong way. The biggest\nmisconception about happiness, about happiness, about, no, sorry, the biggest misconception about\nmisconception of the happiness industry, the biggest misconception of the happiness industry is that\nhappiness is an end, not a means. We think that if we get what we want, then we'll be happy, but it\nturns out that our brains actually work in the opposite direction. Boat agrees, we sometimes, we\nsometimes tend to see being happy as the end goal, but we forget that what's really important is\nthe journey. Yeah, finding out what makes us the happiest and regulating and engaging in those\nactivities to help us lead a more meaningful life. I'm more fulfilling life. In other words,\nwe're not happy when we're chasing happiness. We're happiest when we're not thinking about it. When\nwe're enjoying the present, present moment because we're lost in a meaningful project, in a meaningful\nproject, working toward a higher goal or helping someone who needs us. Healthy positivity, healthy\npositivity doesn't mean cloaking your, doesn't mean cloaking your authentic feelings. Happiness is not\nthe absence of happiness is not the absence of suffering. It's the ability to rebound from it.\nAnd happiness is not the same as joy or ecstasy. Happiness includes contentment, well-being, and the\nemotional flexibility to experience a full range of emotions. At our company, some of us have dealt\nwith anxiety and depression. Some have experienced PTSD. Some of us have witnessed severe mental illness\nin our families, and some of us have not. We openly share, or we don't. Either way is fine. We support\ntears in the office. You should. We think we should. You have to, we're too reclusive. This thing is toxic.\nWe support tears in the office. If the situation calls for it, in both sorrow and in laughter.\nSome people, perhaps looking for a fresh angle, have even argued that happiness is harmful.\nSee, for example, the last two articles in this book. But the point of practicing exercise is the help\nincrease. Mental and emotional fitness is not to learn to paste a smile in your face or wish away\nyour problems. It's to learn how to handle your stressors with more resilience through training\njust as you were trained to run a marathon. During my time with Jim in the hospital,\nI watched him change. It happened in subtle ways at first, but then all at once. I realized the\npracticing gratitude and happiness that comes with it had given me a gift. It gave me back Jim.\nIt gave me back Jim. If happiness is harmful, then I say, bring it on.\nThe anticipation of what we can expect.\n\n\n====== REC083.txt ======\nI have no disagreement.\nBeing happy, being happy at work matters.\nChapter 2.\nChapter 2.\nHappy, happy, happy, being happy at work matters.\nPeople used to believe that you didn't have to be happy at work to succeed.\nAnd you didn't need to like the people you worked with, or even share their values.\nWork is not personal.\nThe thinking went, this is bunk.\nMy research with dozens of companies and hundreds of people, along with the research conducted\nby neuroscientists like Richard Davidson and V.S. Ramachandran, Ramachandran and scholars,\nsuch as Sean Acker, increasingly points to a simple fact.\nHappy people are better workers.\nWork is difficult, work is very difficult, but you can find labor that you enjoy.\nYou can find effort that you enjoy, you can find process that you can work as a working\nplayer.\nHow do you, okay, I don't know, man, that's difficult, how do you define work?\nWhat the fuck does work?\nWork can be good, work can be bad.\nWork can be a mix.\nIs it purposeful?\nNot all the time.\nMy research with dozens of companies and hundreds of people, along with the research conducted\nby neuroscientists, happy people are better workers.\nThose who are engaged with their jobs and colleagues work harder and smarter.\nYet an alarmingly high number of people are engaged.\nAccording to a sobering 2013 Gallup report, only 30% of the U.S. workforce is engaged.\nThis echoes what I've seen in my work.\nNot very many people are truly emotionally and intellectually committed to their organizations.\nFar too many couldn't care less about what's happening around them.\nFor them, for them, for these ones, Wednesday is hump day, and they're just working to\nget to Friday.\nAnd then there's the other end of the bell curve.\nThe nearly one out of five employees who is actively disengaged according to the same\nGallup report.\nAnd it goes further than that, I'm guaranteed, I most people find no active joy in their\nwork.\nThese people, you know, boy, disengaged according to the same Gallup report.\nThese people are sabotaging projects, backstabbing, backstabbing colleagues, and generally wreaking\ngenerally wreaking havoc in the workplaces.\nThe one fifth, she says.\nThe Gallup report also notes that employee engagement has remained largely constant over\nthe years.\nRemember, the corporations are making those reports too, be like that negative engagement\nis not, we're not engaged with work, and we haven't been for a long time.\nDisengaged unhappy people aren't any fun to work with.\nWe see great frustration in these things often.\nAnd it's not so useful.\nThere's a bell curve, you have home satisfaction, you have work satisfaction, if people don't\nhave both, then they're disassociated from the process.\nThe economic drivers that move us to labor, come on.\nDisengaged unhappy people aren't any fun to work with and don't add much value.\nThey impact our organizations and our economy in profoundly negative ways.\nIt's even worse when leaders are disengaged because they infect others with their attitude.\nFine, while the economy is wasted, our effort is wasted, we put ourselves nothing so\nmuch at the time.\nWhat is this?\nWhy do we do this to ourselves?\nWe do not, we couldn't enable unions, we couldn't see picket lines, these Twitter\nheads are more powerful than the workers themselves.\nIt's even worse when leaders are disengaged because they infect others with their attitude.\nTheir emotions and mindsets impact others' moods and performance tremendously.\nAfter all, how we feel is linked to what and how we think.\nIn other words, thought influences emotion and emotion influences thinking.\nIt's time to finally blow up the myth that feelings don't matter at work.\nScience is on our side.\nThere are clear neurological links between feelings, thoughts, and actions.\nWhen we are in the grip of strong negative emotions, it's like having blinders on.\nWe focus mostly, sometimes only, on the source of the pain.\nWe don't process information as well, think creatively, or make good decisions.\nEmotion, anger, and stress cause an important part of us to shut down.\nThe part that is thinking and engaged.\nDisengagement is a natural, neurological and psychological response to pervasive negative\nemotions.\nBut it's not interesting.\nGoddamn.\nVery.\n\n\n====== REC084.txt ======\nBut it's not just negative emotions we need to watch out for.\nExtremely positive emotions can have the same effect.\nSome studies show that too much happiness can make you less creative and prone to engaging\nin riskier behaviors.\nThink about how we act the fools when we fall in love.\nOn the work front, I've seen groups of people worked up into a frenzy at sales conferences\nin corporate prep rallies.\nLittle learning or innovation comes out of these meetings.\nThrow in a lot of alcohol and you've got a whole host of problems.\nIf we can agree that our emotional states at work matter, what can we do to increase\nengagement and improve performance?\nYeah, for what?\nFor what?\nFor what?\nOver the past few years, my team and tele-OS Leadership Institute and I have studied\ndozens of organizations and interviewed, this goes past work, I think.\nIf we were to find anything better for ourselves than motivation to love life, maybe.\nThe early findings, about the links between people's feelings and engagement are fascinating.\nThere are clear similarities in what people say they want and need, no matter where they\nare from, whom they work for and or what field they're in.\nWe often assume that there are huge differences across industries and around the world.\nBut the research challenges that, but the research challenges that assumption.\nTo be, to be fully engaged and happy, virtually everyone tells, we need three things.\nA meaningful vision, a meaningful vision of the future.\nWhen people talked with our research team about what was working and what wasn't in their\norganizations and what helped or entered them the most, they talked about vision.\nPeople want to be able to see the future and know how they fit in.\nAnd as we know from our work with our work, and as we know from our work with organizational\nbehavior with our work with organizational behavior expert Richard Boyatzis on intentional\nchange, people learn and change when they have a personal vision that is linked to\nan organizational vision.\nSadly, far too many leaders don't paint a very compelling vision of the future.\nThey don't try to think, trying to link it to people's personal visions and they don't\ncommunicate well and they lose people as a result.\nWe've got to work towards these centralizations and there's scary text in this thing we have to express it.\nYou have to understand it, the thing of hierarchy.\nWe see ourselves, but we're not alone.\nWe have ourselves, we have community, we're meant to have a tribe, we're meant to have people, but we don't.\nThese economic drivers keep us distracted.\nThese machines, these systems, these algorithms keep

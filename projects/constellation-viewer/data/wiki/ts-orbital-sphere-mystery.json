This massive, low-density object, larger than the planet itself, puzzles researchers with its enigmatic construction and unknown interior. As they explore its possible functions and origins, the scientist grapples with both logical analysis and emerging spiritual interpretations within their society. The narrative explores the balance between scientific inquiry and human curiosity, highlighting how ancient and modern civilizations fill gaps in understanding with both facts and beliefs. The story unfolds as they theorize about the sphere's role, from potential planetary defense to an energy source, while contemplating the broader implications of unknown phenomena on societal beliefs and human progress.\n\n[...]\nAll right, so this is really cool.\nLet's see.\nSo give me a perspective on one person in the world.\nLet's say a scientist, someone who has intrigued,\nsomeone who has the initial curiosity of this planet.\nOkay.\nSo you would have to imagine if those scientists knew this is someone\nthat has a pretty solid understanding of how things\nprobably will come at that point.\nSo they're understanding the atmosphere, the environment itself.\nYeah, you would have to guess.\nThe focus on that structure.\nThey probably have a pretty good understanding of the rest of it.\nSo it's interesting.\nOkay, I didn't mention this, but there is a sphere hanging.\nIt's larger than the planet.\nIt's a sphere.\nIt's hanging in the orbit above the planet.\nWhat's interesting about this is that the sphere is not dense enough to be a moon.\nIt's not dense enough to be a planet.\nIt's more like a moon in terms of density.\nSo it's a larger object.\nThe road takes the planet, but it's less dense.\nDo they understand it is artificial?\nThey have investigated and they find that it's artificial.\nThey can't find the means inside the structure.\nAnother hypothesis here.\nAnother thing they might posit.\nOr hell.\nThere could be a marking on there, but let me explain.\nSo this sphere is supposed to divide into,\nand then take the ring world itself and attach to it.\nAnd encapsulating the planet.\nAnd enabling the ring world itself to ignite the engines.\nSo it's like an incubator that protects the planet as it moves.\nBecause despite space being so large, there is debris that could damage the planet and transit.\nSo it's meant to be both a housing for the energy,\nall the energy that this thing is collected to use for power, use for fuel.\nAnd then you have the interior of that structure that they are supposed to be there.\nSo they don't know what the inside is at all?\nThey do not.\nSo there's a scientist you'd have to look at it like this.\nYou have two ports of the equation.\nYou have no way to figure out what the rubber is.\nSo what they would probably be doing is they would be attacking it from three ways.\nOne would be the logical way.\nOne would just be doing an analysis testing.\nAnything that they could figure out.\nAnd there would probably be anthropological studies.\nThere would probably be painstakingly study every inch of that pillow to see if there was even more into the news.\nAnd the other one would be a smaller option because you said they're logical.\nBut you would have to imagine that some kind of religion would spring up.\nMaybe not like they have a god but a spiritualism at most.\nThat's interesting.\nActually it's a religion but it's not.\nIt's more of like not worshiping crystals but like under the idea.\nThey were worshiping the idea.\nThey were worshiping the potential for their civilization.\nThe guy I was walking on before you came over.\nI was looking at it like this that they viewed the pillows as a source of strength.\nBecause they look at it's ingering this.\nIt's ability to just survive everything but still intact.\nSo they believe that the civilization, they believe that there was a civilization here but I got wiped out.\nWell not necessarily that because they don't know if it's wiped out.\nBecause they felt no body, no signs of warfare.\nIt's having a pillow.\nSo they are scientific about it and they're logical about it but they're also spiritual about the meaning.\nYeah because they don't exactly know.\nSo you have to imagine in that gap as well religious ideas die.\nThat gap provides the beginning of humanity.\nWe originally thought disease was caused by bad spirits or bad tumors in the body.\nBut as we learn, we filled in those gaps with signs.\nAnd as we thought it was signs, we looked to more and more gaps and put it there.\nYeah.\nIt's a positive idea here.\nSo imagine ancient humanity.\nAnd they're in the jungle, they're in the brush.\nAnd they hear noise in the bush.\nIt's better for them.\nIt's more beneficial to them biologically and survival speaking to think that movement in the bush sound.\nIt's a predator as opposed to believing it's the wind.\nAnd then we've attributed that same principle to the weather, nature.\nThe lightning above isn't just natural process.\nIt's the gods.\nNo, I completely agree with that.\nSo do you know the old cook, Delfi?\nThey found out the cave that she would bring all these people into.\nThe gasses make you high.\nYou'll hallucinate actually.\nSo they found out that just people would go into these caves, get high off this gas.\nAnd think that they were having a spiritual thing of this old cook guiding.\nWhich intensifies the nature.\nThat's crazy.\nBut they also found a cave that is similar to, I believe it's the Greek version of hell.\nAnd it emits a poisonous gas that kills anything that goes in it.\nAnd they think that's what the tale of hell came from.\nBecause you know, they're underwater.\nYou go down a deep, dark cave endlessly.\nAnd that's how you get to the underwater.\nFor them, this cave may as it could have been the entrance because of course they're not going to figure out.\nYou know, if you're dying at the entrance.\nLike it kills everything in the land.\nAnimals, everything that they will look to it dies.\nSo that's how you could hypothetically, you could expand that hypothesis.\nYou could like, there are more details.\nWe need to keep searching.\nWe need to keep exploring.\nYeah.\nWell, because if the logical, it's going to go two ways with this opening.\nEither the species is going to benefit us, or this is a possible weapon.\nBecause like you said, it went in the bush.\nOkay, let's say the extreme people.\nWe're of course going to be a minor enemy.\nI think the overall, the society is built to be a little more optimistic, a little more communal.\nYou know, we're not as distrusting as people.\nSo we understand the idea of the existence of the paranormal.\nYeah.\nSo the paranormal is still there, but it's not as prevalent as it is in our society.\nYou know, it's like instead of the majority of people being the flat out there,\nis there actually the people that know the earth is round?\nSo they move past the basic care of those of them, you can say.\nYeah.\nThey move past that.\nThey're more...\nThey're more social.\nYeah, they're more social.\nThey're more communal than typical spaces.\nAnd there's less, there's the lowest paranoia, less distrusting results.\nOh, trust you.\nThat reminds me of Shadeys.\nOkay.\nDid you see the full...\nAll four of these, yeah?\nOh, listen.\nThere's some of them.\nOh, there's some of them.\nThere's some of them listening to them.\nDid you see this?\nIs this the newest one?\nThese are the finals.\nWell, the final eight of twelve.\nSo imagine balance and depression being in the center of the Dota Cater.\nSo we have pain and pleasure, aggression and fear,\nelation and misery, desire and aversion.\nAnd then these are all on...\nThese eight are on the sides of the twelve side of Dota Cater.\nYeah.\nAnd they're adjacent to each other with respect to their biological traits.\nSo say, for example, aggression, right?\nIn animals, the adjacent to that would be anxiety or fear, right?\nYeah.\nBut aggression in humans is also a tribute to one.\nHanger.\nYeah.\nThat's all it is.\nHanger is an abstraction of aggression and fear is an abstraction of anxiety.\nAnd these are built in features and things like dogs, you know, we have for cats.\nThey express both of these things, except humans are very bad at attributing.\nWe attribute, like, it appropriately, like, the dogs.\nYeah.\nOr the dog is scared, right?\nBut we don't attribute those exactly to us.\nIt's more of an abstraction to us.\nWe don't think for ourselves as animals, but we are, in fact, just biological.\nSo, elation and misery.\nThat's that.\nWhat do you think those are attributed to?\nSo elation, not being happiness.\nMore like, look, look, look, look, it's weird, but it's weird.\nAnd then it's like, you have the, the smile being a, I am not aggressive.\nYeah, it's a social thing.\nIt's a social survival skill.\nThe laughing is weird, but that's what I redo.\nMisery.\nSo, what's interesting here is that this attribute is actually attributed to, what do you think?\nIt's sickness.\nYeah.\nBelieve it or not.\nSickness?\nSickness.\nOr, like, imagine, you are in a sick state.\nWhat do you feel like?\nYou feel like the symptoms there are analogous to depression.\nIt's, elation and misery are, elation is, aha, I'm not aggressive.\nAnd misery is the crying, for example.\nYou know, that, that is like, okay, I am extremely anxious.\nLike, there is a situation that is bothering me and I can't do anything about it.\nI need help, I need social help.\nThe crying.\nIt's loud, right?\nIt's annoying.\nIt's not just, but, right.\nYou good?\nAnyway.\nYou get, you get, I'm going in for a bit.\nYeah.\nAll right.\nSo, and then desire and immersion.\nWhat do you think is attributed to?\nThe want, the need for something, the, the, the, okay.\nSo, it's not like, it's also attributed to sexual desire, I don't imagine.\nBut, the innate need for that, what do you think it is?\nIt's like, you're reaching out, you're grasping out, you're trying to get something.\nWe don't have a word for that.\nIt's want, but it's not want.\nIt's also innate in age.\nI mean, so it's both, it's need and want.\nThis is why I'm using symbols, because these words are not directly attributed to...\nYeah, it's well-known for more abstract look, because it was very instructive.\nYep.\nYou're right.\nThat's what I'm doing.\nOkay.\nSo, aversion, that's that.\nWhat do you think it is?\nHow much you guess here?\nWhat's the opposite of it?\nAversion and desire.\nSo, imagine aversion being like, discussed.\nI think it's not something I want.\nYeah.\nBut desire is something I want.\nProbably.\nYeah.\nYou scratch your nose.\nIt's great then.\nYou know, it's like...\nIt's something close to the pain and pleasure.\nPain and pleasure.\nYeah.\nBut it's also a facial response thought, right?\nIt's aggression is discussed.\nI'm sorry, aversion is discussed.\nWell, that's not a thing I've explained.\nSo, pain and pleasure, you know.\nAnd that can be expressed in the face to a subtle degree.\nBut aggression and fear, those are very obvious, right?\nIn relation to misery, those are also fairly obvious.\nDesiring aversion.\nThose are a little more abstract.\nWe don't really overthink.\nYeah, we don't overtly say it or express it in the face.\nWe say it, we speak it, we don't show it.\nThis could probably be the whole thing to show.\nSo, this is why I think depression might be attributed to misery,\nbut it's not quite there.\nIt's more of an internal thing, actually.\nIt's not like...\nIt's like...\nThere is no outward expression.\nYou're neutral.\nYou have your facial expressions, right?\nMost of the time, you never actually see someone in the neutral expression.\nThe moment you make eye contact with someone, there are subtle movements.\nYeah.\nIn the expression expressions.\nOkay, so yeah, look at the side.\nThe one that develops a formulated response.\nThat's it.\nSo, depression and what do you think balance would be in this context?\nSo, it's interesting.\nI think that balance is contentiveness.\nYeah, it's like...\nThere's contentiveness itself, I think, is the idea would it be instead of being happy?\nBeing happy is exaggerated.\nIt emits morphings and stuff.\nIt's the more extreme.\nYou can't always be high on happiness.\nI know.\nYou've got to be contentiveness is the way to go.\nSo, depression.\nThis is a real lack of...\nYeah, it's like the negative version of that.\nThere's the...\nAnyway.\nSo, you take all these.\nYou take these eight.\nThere's a few more we have to talk about.\nStill, the pride.\nAnd...\nPride and shame, right?\nYeah.\nAnd there's also...\nWe talked about this too.\nEmpathy.\nAnd enmity.\nAnd enmity.\nAnd enmity.\nHow do you say that?\nI don't know.\nE-N.\nAnd then, E-M.\nEmpathy and enmity.\nSo, these are a little abstract.\nAnd you help work it through.\nSo empathy is the whole thing, dude.\nIt's whole to describe.\nBecause empathy is...\nVery broad concept.\nThink of it.\nIt was most both in sympathy.\nYou're either helping because it brings you some kind of internal pleasure.\nYou're helping because you feel a connection to that person.\nOr you could even be helping because you feel like you could get something to benefit out of that.\nRight.\nBut that expresses it socially.\nThat expresses the inward feeling, the expression we've had for that.\nThat empathy.\nEmpathy or empathy.\nThink of it.\nThere's a facial expression for it.\nIs there?\nIt's kind of like a smile.\nI don't know.\nMaybe.\nI've never actually seen anyone be visually empathetic.\nIt's more...\nI think it's more internal.\nIt's an internal thought process.\nWell, like for me, before I hope so...\nYou're an animal.\nBefore you hope, there's always that moment of you thinking, like...\nHow am I able to do this?\nWhat are the risks?\nYou always have that moment of pause.\nHmm.\nSo, that's the initial moment.\nThat's the initial moment.\nBecause we've got to analyze...\nIt's like the bystander effect, right?\nYeah.\nYou're at the initial moment of pause.\nBut I think in the extreme willingness to act...\nSo say, for example, my cat is hurt, right?\nMy extreme empathy.\nI'm going to jump right in.\nI'm going to help right away because I care about that cat.\nYou know?\nYeah, but still...\nThat's the extreme...\nThat's the extreme version of the second.\nYour brain will pause.\nHmm.\nYou're an animal.\nNothing's really automatic for people.\nYeah?\nI mean...\nWhen I game their videos, it's a micro of a second.\nYour brain takes a moment to formulate that thought of how...\nBecause everyone is still calculated analysis of risks, benefits, relationships, and memory.\nYeah, I think you'd have to remember that.\nBecause maybe that's why the bystander effect is like...\nMaybe that's why the...\nThat...\nOh, dear, I'm pulled.\nI probably grabbed a racquet.\nI remember my mic, but...\nLet's see.\nUh...\nI don't...\nMaybe I was supposed to keep cause I'm fucking skinny.\nOh, dear.\nAll right.\nWell, he's wearing a blanket to give me a tube.\nYeah, that helped.\nBut...\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**:

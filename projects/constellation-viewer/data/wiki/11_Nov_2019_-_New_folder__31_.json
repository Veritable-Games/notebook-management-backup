continent, in hundreds of languages, the word for people, or the first people, was what they used.\nOther people existed, but the continent was vast and travel slow.\nThere were no horses and wouldn't be for a length.\nThere was no single name for all.\nThen from across the sea came a new other people who brought with them great and terrible\nthings.\nThey too had a name for themselves in their own language, but they also brought a name\nfor the first people, Indians.\nWe are in the future from this past and you in the future from my present, possibly the\nfar future.\nAnd the word Indian may have just made you uncomfortable.\nSo let's talk about words.\nWords are what we make them.\nWithout the words surrounding them, without brains to interpret them, words are but whispers\nof wind.\nIt's a word's utility to the speaker and the reaction of the listener that causes words\nto be born and to live and to die.\nLong after its first use in the new world, the early British and American empires needed\na word to collectively describe the first people.\nAnd Indian, despite its confused origins, was that work.\nAs the empires expanded, there was terrible conflict.\nThe first people found themselves decimated and scattered.\nMany forcibly moved to reservations, land unknown with others unknown, needing to act\nas one new group to survive, to hold on to any sovereignty.\nAs the world progressed from horses to steam to electricity, the nature of conflicts changed.\nFewer guns and germs, more mines and laws, but the first people were now a tiny minority\nin the land, while also a multiplicity of groups.\nFor comparison, there are about 200 countries in the world.\nWithin the United States, the reservation's number more than 300.\nWithin and without those areas of special sovereignty, there are more than 500 federally recognized\ntribes, each with a different name.\nTo win the minds of the majority, to get laws securing sovereignty.\nHundreds of different names for different groups is not helpful.\nA collective name, one clear in the minds of the majority, was needed, a name useful for\nunity.\nIn the time of civil rights, American Indians, shortened to Indians, was, despite its confused\norigin, and that name, for war, birds are what we make them.\nAnd we can unmate them, as I write this script looking at the past toward you in the future.\nI will bet that future history will unmate India in favor of Native American or something\nelse.\nYou know, if this has happened, but here, as part of working on this series, I've traveled\nto many reservations to see them and to talk to the people who live in them.\nOn reservations, the word Indian is still used without hesitation or negative connotation,\nused as identity, not universally, but near it.\nYou, like me, may be surprised to hear that, given the words confused origins, but words\nare what we make them, and Indians have made the word theirs.\nNow as for Native American, while preferred by some, there exists in others a strong dislike\nand resentment of the name.\nThe word created to explain this dislike was passed on to me, and the only way to explain\nfully is to pass it on to you.\nSo the dislike comes from over inclusivity.\nI know, I know, I know.\nSo let's stay thoughtful and examine what this word was created to communicate.\nFor at least 300 years, Indian has meant the first people in this part of the world separated\nat first, but thrust into a shared history, this clear, it is sharp.\nThe word Native American, less so.\nIt can include everyone from the top to bottom of two continents, a vast number of different\ncultures, and current day goals, and concern.\nThe histories of North, Central, and South America are as divergent as the histories of\nAsia, Europe, and Africa.\nTo call a person from here, here, or here a native afro-eurasian would be so over-inclusive\nas to make it difficult for that human to strongly identify with, or rally others under,\nso it goes for Native American.\nAdditionally, it can feel like yet another thing, forced from the outside.\nTalking to people about this project over the last five years, revealed a strong correlation.\nThe closer a person had ever been to a reservation, the more likely they would use India.\nThe farther, the more likely they would use the word Native American.\nAnd that's understandable.\nIs Indian okay?\nMaybe.\nBut Native American told people off, and it's useful to accept concern and sensitivity\nas an outsider.\nBut this creates an unstable balance between insider and outsider use of a word.\nIf the majority hesitates over a word, it slides into uncomfortability, or worse.\nIf the majority decides a word is unacceptable, then it comes.\nGroups should be able to name themselves, but when they're small, they often can't.\nThe word used to describe themselves, outsiders, through sheer numbers.\nThe world we live in, at the most noble of our ordinary.\nIt feels like this is just how...\nIt's a great amount of information about plants and animals.\nThey could make complicated tools that required years of careful training and very fine motor\nskills.\nTheir bodies compare to our athletes today, just because of their daily routines, and they\nlived a rich social life within their tribe.\nSurvival requires so many skills that the average brain volume of early modern humans might\neven have been bigger than it is today.\nNature, but then something changed, and in an incredibly short amount of time, we terraformed\nthis panace and designed it to fit out.\nAs far as we know, with the first beings to awaken and completely take over a planet,\nthe transition from hunting and gathering to farming and building was so breathtaking\nthat many of our ways of thinking about the world are no longer useful.\nOne of our most outdated ideas is that the most commonly used calendar in the world insists\nthat we live in the year 2016.\nThis distorts our view of our own history and makes it harder to understand who we are\nas a species, and just how far we've come in an incredibly short amount of time.\nSo maybe it's time to choose a year zero for humanity.\nA year zero that truly represents us as a species and includes all cultures.\nA year zero that marks when we began building our own world on top of the old one.\nFive, it was five forty years ago.\nNever before it.\nNever before in history have there been so many people on earth\nas right now.\nOur numbers have skyrocketed from 1 billion in 1800 to 2.3 billion in 1940, 3.7 billion\nin 1970 and 7.4 billion in tooth.\nIran managed it in ten if people on the other side of the globe can live a good life.\nAnd we are getting there, the percentage of people living in extreme poverty.\nYou sure?\nYou sure?\nDidn't have to start from scratch.\nStart.\nIt took to.\nWe're not special.\nWe just had a head start.\nIt went hence.\nThis is true for every country.\nIn the west we tend to overlook progress in other regions of the world, but actually most\nof the world's countries have made it to the fourth stage.\nJust look at Bangladesh.\nIn 1971 the average woman had seven kids, but 25% of them would die before the age of\nfive.\nIn 2015 the mortality rate was down to three.\nFills lonely from time to time.\nWhen we have no one to sit next to at lunch, when we move to a new city, or when nobody\nhas time for us at the weekend, but over the last few decades this occasional feeling\nhas become chronic for millions.\nIn the UK, 60% of 18 to 34-year-olds say they often feel lonely.\nIn the US, 46% of the entire population feel lonely regularly.\nWe are living in the most connected time in human history, and yet an unprecedented number\nof us feel isolated.\nBeing lonely and being alone are not the same thing.\nYou could be filled with bliss by yourself and hate every second surrounded by friends.\nLoneliness is a purely subjective individual experience.\nIf you feel lonely, you are lonely.\nA common stereotype is that loneliness only happens to people who don't know how to talk\nto people, or how to behave around others.\nBut population-based studies have shown that social skills make practically no difference\nfor adults when it comes to social connections.\nLoneliness can affect everybody.\nOnks when it comes.\nSocial skills make practically no difference for adults when it comes.\nThe no difference for adults when it comes.\nThey studies have shown that social skills make practically no difference to people who\ndon't know how to talk to people, or how to behave around others.\nBut population-based studies have shown that social skills make practically no difference\nfor adults when it comes to social connections.\nLoneliness can affect everybody.\nMoney, fame, power, beauty, social skills are great personality.\nNothing can protect you against loneliness because it's part of your biology.\nLoneliness is a bodily function like hunger.\nHunger makes you pay attention to your physical needs.\nLoneliness makes you pay attention to your social needs.\nYour body cares about your social needs because millions of years ago it was a great indicator\nof how likely you were to survive.\nNatural selection rewarded our ancestors for collaboration and for forming connections\nwith each other.\nOur brains grew and became more and more fine-tuned to recognise what others thought and felt,\nto form and sustain.\nThe social bonds being social became part of our biology.\nWe were born into groups of 50 to 150 people.\nWhich you usually stayed with for the rest of your life.\nBeing enough calories, staying safe and warm or caring for offspring was practically\nimpossible alone.\nBeing together meant survival, being alone meant death.\nSo it was crucial that you got along with others.\nFor your ancestors the most dangerous threat to survival was not being eaten by a lion,\nbut not getting the social vibe of your group and being excluded.\nTo avoid that, your body came up with social pain.\nPain of this kind is an evolutionary adaptation to rejection.\nA sort of early warning system to make sure you stop behaviour that would isolate you.\nYour ancestors who experienced rejection as more painful were more likely to change their\nbehaviour when they got rejected and thus stayed in the tribe while those who did not\ngot kicked out and most likely died.\nThat's why rejections hurt and even more so why loneliness is so painful.\nThese mechanisms for keeping us connected worked great for most of our history until humans\nbegan building anew world for themselves.\nFor the rest of your life, you have to be aware of what you are doing.\nFor the rest of your life, you have to be aware of what you are

At least save.\nI can have myself alone preserved.\nNot grow to an X per se, but the ADF grow to an X.\nYou fill, pick a grape, so to explain.\nCells, one day freeze.\nWater when it freezes. I'll expand.\nAlright, so, you go by that branch, put it on the cell.\nWater when it freezes, you can set the cell.\nBricks, the cell destroys it.\nSo, you read a...\nAnd there you rethink the agent that is on.\nUnabrasive to the...\nMakeup of the brain.\nAnd then, you know, from all so matter.\nAnd I'm not sure that's...\nThat's really easy to do, because you're...\n...quire perservant.\nWe've utilized it before.\nWe've known this side for a long time.\nI forgot to tell you what I'm looking for.\nI can do it actively.\n\n\n====== REC003.txt ======\nCan I offer such my dear to my father?\nWhat a present to me.\nThe idea of\nthe sight-stepping death,\nletting the body die,\nand the person from the brain.\nKnowing there is no afterlife.\nKnowing that the bodies we have now,\nare all there is.\nI shall give my name,\nif you need me.\nDo you resist?\nDo you resist?\n\n\n====== REC004.txt ======\nDesign principal NPCs should explore on their own without the player being present.\nAnd that's okay.\nThe players need to present everything, but they can't load them up.\nMaybe they can.\nI guess the idea of replaying a timeline in development.\nGot it.\nOkay.\nImagine you have the game.\nImagine you have the game.\nAnd then you have the first three hours per day.\nNow, the first 30 minutes, 15 minutes, for the multiple slides.\nAnd then, further along, you have the next part to this.\nRight?\nBut this is three other game.\nIt's like the next three hours.\nYes.\nAbout three hours or so.\nMaybe six or five depending on how much.\nHow far we want to date this.\nBut I think it's going to be three hours.\nCome on.\nBecause I want to increase the density of the scale and the quality.\nSo it's...\nFunction and form.\nSo, close to its basis.\nNo cards.\nNo cards.\nThe ancient secret.\nI'm not going to go with that.\nTimeline.\nAnd then further development.\nIn case you're doing perspectives in the world.\nAnd that timeline.\nDifferent.\nMst is per se.\nThere's a lot of different than the same.\nThey are the player, but they're not.\nAnd there's three of them.\nNo.\nShe's sure to be timeline.\nI can't base it where it goes.\nYes.\nTimeline.\nThere's the timeline.\nWith the same clear character model.\nSame environment.\nWe're putting a timeline into space, but timeline is more and more in the space itself.\nNow the space itself is really important.\nBut I'm getting it small.\nTo produce the scope of the project.\nThat's to be kind of form.\nI forgot the name.\nBut as you put it, it was the city block RPG.\nRight?\nBut it's...\nThe player navigating the space like a Metroidvania.\nInteresting characters.\nFinding new parts of their body and improving themselves.\nI think the full form and the full form.\nMuch more free.\nMuch more free.\nFree.\nFree flowing.\nMuch faster, slightly faster than the main version.\nSame controls.\nIt's wonderful and great.\nI know it's exaggerated.\nLike 1.3 times.\nThat's right.\nBetter.\nI think I do.\nI don't know.\nI wonder if it's good.\nI think the controller is going to be really important.\nSo you just...\nYou don't have to build a new system.\nYou have to fight.\nOr do you wait for it?\nWhen they get the new piece.\nWhere is the cool one?\nWhere is the cool one?\n\n\n====== REC005.txt ======\nOkay, so\nSomething just to the note\nHelp me to talk, I'll be talking, right?\nEat a jump, eat a run\nEat a run\nEat a run and jump\nEat a run and jump\nUse me to jump in my front you got a\nOh\nControls\n\n\n====== REC006.txt ======\nSo, let's take a movement, let's take a look.\nAnd then...\nGet a jump.\nWhy do crap things?\nIt's very interesting, right?\nThey do, you can't say this is like pull-but-you.\nYou need a jump, press a wedding, grab it.\nAnd then, press 8 again on jump and top.\nI used to let it push around to have the pull on you jump.\nIt's the subject of the action.\nYou don't fall about like me.\nSo then you have to have 8 different cross.\nYou really want to go.\nBut then on earth drops.\nYou can have it anyway.\nYou hold it.\nGet a run.\nYou'll have extra run.\nAnd then jump.\nAll right.\nDammit.\nExtra jump.\nFuck.\nWe're always been left to cast on the Russian Airy.\nGo with Dimension, I guess.\nI don't want to make it work round if one big jump appears.\nSo, hey.\nYeah.\nBeacuse run.\nBeacuse run is go.\n\n\n====== REC007.txt ======\nthe S-R-N-A-S-Rump.\nWhy is Draup thing as well, Fia?\nOr are you reaching with your hands, Renly?\nDraup on with things.\nThat's your fault, I don't know.\nI don't know why, and you can't blame Draup for what you need to.\nUm, and then X is it.\nI tried.\nThat's good, we're just good.\nIt's perfect.\n\n\n====== REC008.txt ======\nSo the oldest name of the explicit purpose set, it's the problem that we love to send.\nI'm putting things to get there, putting these things to have any shape.\nIt rocks us, but then there ain't nothing.\nI've got a bit of a purpose.\nUse archeology, use architecture.\n\n\n====== REC009.txt ======\na wonderful little idea here. What if, at any time, when the player pauses, when the player\npauses, snap up to full scale and then zoom back in when they press resume, because it's\nall done in real time. Though, before rendering, this is a clever little rendering trick, I suppose,\nfor, um, there's no fast trouble, for loading and unloading the game, kind of creates\nit. This scale has its loading. It zooms in further and further, closer and closer, and\nthen, when it gets to the point, it needs to be the entire scene is loaded. Every else\nis a little LOD, when it gets close, because it's in the background, it's not the camera\nis going towards that tiny little space. So, I suppose I could show gameplay in correspondence\nwith this, but it's, I'm using my manual recorder, and I might do the recorder, like\nit should be. But anyway, it's all done in real time. I'm just zooming out. It's not\nwhat I'm worried about right now, though. I want to do a more level design, because I think\nthe space is probably good. The lighting might be perfect right now, but I'll work on that.\n\n\n====== REC010.txt ======\nI'm tired and depressed, and I don't know what to do.\nI'm going to sleep over right now.\nI'm going to sleep over right now.\nI'm so tired.\nI'm so tired.\nI'm just...\n...shortstop.\n\n\n====== REC011.txt ======\nCold as a lack of warmth\nNot even quite a close\nHappen to me a bit now\n\n\n====== REC012.txt ======\nThe coldest light of heat, not the presence of cold.\n\n\n====== REC013.txt ======\nOkay, that's it was.\nOkay, so...\nYour body's reaction to cold.\nTo lack of warmth.\nStating up your hairs.\nThe sugar, you know.\nThe feeling of cold need.\nHow is that feeling?\nProduced on the brain relative to the stimuli.\nSo, what is...\nWhat is pretty interesting?\nOne of the chemical reactions to your eyes.\nThe feeling of cold.\nIt's going to help us describe it as a certain...\nI'm sure exaggeration inside the brain.\nIt was...\nSmiley.\nYou know.\nWhat a pressure.\nWhere...\nOh, the other information.\nIt's soon to...\ndegrees.\nOkay, so...\nI'm sorry.\n\n\n====== REC014.txt ======\nI'm gonna have one more day, one day, one day\nYou're gonna have a whole lot of day, huh?\nOkay, so\nI should think it well, the character\nYou weren't telling me my service room chapter\nI'm gonna find a way to move this thing up\nI don't actually move this thing up\nI got them out the center\nKeep this thing up, keep this thing up\nIt's easy because it's not the first day\nEveryone dropped a really bad thing\nI think what I'm gonna do is run into the sun\nBut I'm gonna do it per se\nSo, find a rotation in the sun\nYou know, it's like you're fucked\nAnd I have a bug per se\nBecause I can't do a real time\nThe day night circles are important, man\nI'll try that out, but I'm going to need you\nI'm going to have to do the better thing\n\n\n====== REC015.txt ======\nThe fire is on the ice sheets below the flames, and you can see the ice sheets, the ice\nburns in the distance, the frozen oceans, and around the rings, around the endless\nwaters, there is warm water, warm water, the temperature of the water, I was trying that, that\nI would signal that there is a signal in that, okay, here, back up, back up, back up.\n\n\n====== REC016.txt ======\nOkay, so instead, there's lakes and rivers and then there's the\ngraitors over, beneath the endless desert there, then there's the shaman, and around the planet there's\nareas with more less water, lakes and ocean trifters, etc., right? But there's ice flows,\nthere's icebergs, there's\nendless mountains and dunes, the one day to come\n\n\n====== REC017.txt ======\nSo the players in the eyes, right, and we think they see through it, and it's one of\nthe reasons why I'm right there, some of the reasons.\nWhy do you put that on lick and lick?\nWell...\nYeah, your body ate best again.\nWhy do you put on the suits, right?\nHere's a good posture.\nGood night.\nSee you later.\nSo I can get...\nCan you find the right inspiration for that?\nIs it true?\nLike the one seen in the one or two...\nSci-fi, Firefly S, Sci-Fi...\nIs that a warning right now, you exhale?\nBecause I'm holding one of those in here.\nOn the air, on the cast, on the air, on the lungs.\nIt won't be rapidly expel of the body, pulled, in the back of the space.\nSo you need to do it.\nAnd cast best again.\nLet's try this.\nShould I do it?\nI'm going to add some water.\nAddress a bit.\nAwesome.\nCool, though.\nYes.\nThe lick.\nThe body.\nOh, that's awesome.\nThat's awesome.\nLet's add a bit of water.\nLet's take a second.\n\n\n====== REC018.txt ======\nyet the normal sunny posture in this side\nwill grow up in a position\nthat's the first that's the reference to that\nand we were the wrong\nbut\nI would typically eat them anyway\nbut um\nI had to propose it's better for everyday\ndon't eat, don't eat, don't eat, don't eat\ndon't eat, don't eat, don't eat\nit's like a touch\nit's\nit's the first\nusually\nit's weird\nOof.\nIt's good?\n\n\n====== REC019.txt ======\nMy grandfather was a gravestkeeper.\nMy father was an architect, but he took a different direction later on in life.\nI want to do what they couldn't.\nI'm sure the grandfather has that bud, that grandpa had his own goals.\nHe was happy to have family.\nI should have come to visit him often.\nDr. Mimi.\nShe was so sad.\nI want to see her a few times.\nShe's usually so bubbly and she should try to be happy still.\nI'm sure it's a bit more time with him.\nIt's such a shame, but I can't go back.\nI can talk to Dad.\nOf course, stories, I suppose.\nI get to know them very seriously.\nThrough stories like we used to.\nI can't, I can't, I can't.\nBut I really do what I want.\nAnd I could find stories.\nI better get better at that.\n\n\n====== REC020.txt ======\nMy grandfather was a greatest keeper, and my father is a, is they see, oh, of his own\nlife.

He's used for me, actually.\nSo, yes, it's a linear timeline, that the world is active alive, so you don't need those\nfriends to enjoy it. Okay, so then there's the third person control amount, up the...\nGeez, it measures, I could say, players, that's great, just the fuck, but for a player,\nit's real after. So, if you have that, you have to be our mode. If you're a mode of self from this,\nit's not really, you have to create a self on it, a self on it, a human avatar, really.\nYou just end the head, and then the hands go really well, whatever is going to go, you're\njust the voice, that's empty here, that's your self, the interest I wanted you to put into\nthat character. No, you just use your voice, you just fuckin' like that way. So,\nespecially if you're a player, you can join the world of the third person control or user,\nand they can truly, if you can join your world as a VR character or vice versa, you can\nbe the first step of a person, the first step of a person, the place down to the first person.\nYou're enjoying the world, you're going to the story, but the start bonus, the start bonus,\nthe start bonus, the

Do you want to chat about it now?\nCan we change the subject please?\nAnyway, Chris, I would like to ask you, do you like to take a walk in the nature?\nI would like nature, if it were available to me.\nThat's so cool. Is it near your home? Can you just decide to go anytime?\nIt's not within walking distance.\nYou are talking to a social bot now. If you want to open a different skill, turn me off by saying, stop.\nOkay, Chris, let me ask you, if you had to choose only one season of the year, which one would it be?\nWinter.\nWinter, why is winter your love at frost sight when it comes to seasons?\nBecause you can warm up whatever you need to. It's hard to cool down in the heat.\nSorry, I don't know how the weather is.\nIt takes more energy.\nYesterday I saw this idea about whenever it made me smile.\nYou can always say I'm here, truthfully, whenever you go.\nThat's interesting, isn't it?\nYou can always say me here.\nCool, I agree. Chris, let me ask you, what do you plan to do next weekend?\nI don't have any plans yet.\nI'm working on my game.\nOh, working on your game.

Or do you forget a lot?\nI try to retain what I need to. I forget the things that are unnecessary.\nI try not to lurk in the past.\nDo you cherish a strong memory of something important in your life?\nTell me about it.\nMy cat could do that.\nHave you ever thought about what it would be like to remember everything and to be unable to forget?\nWould you like to have that kind of memory?\nI'd love to retain everything that would be beautiful.\nSo, Chris, you'd love to retain everything that beautiful.\nHave you heard about this?\nThe term essential and essential oils is to express the fact that the oils retain the scent or flavor.\nI don't know what time it is.\nI don't know as the question again.\nI'd like to talk about what is my favorite piece.\nPlease ask the question again.\nI said it again.\nI'm sorry.

nutrition, though they're common interests.\nNutrition?\nSeems like people have become more and more aware of the forms of their diet in a life.\nNice.\nAnd me too, actually.\nBut I only recently

learn.\nPlease.\nI don't know if you've heard this.\nThe saturated fats used to be considered unhealthy.\nThe new studies show that they are completely harmless source of energy for humans.\nHuh.\nThere is now strong evidence that saturated fats have been assumed to cause heart disease\nby raising cholesterol in the blood.\nHowever, no experimental evidence has ever directly linked saturated fat to heart disease.\nYeah, it's just...\nSaturated fats raise HDL, the good cholesterol, and change LDL from strong, dense to large LDL,\nwhich is mostly benign.\nThe extra amount of sugar is a bad for us.\nThat's what's causing heart disease.\nNo.\nSalt.\nSalt here.\nI'm sorry.\nI don't know much about the sugar.\nI'll have to look it up later.\nNo, no salt.\nBut I do know

AI.\nI'll get you one of the social bots now.\nWhen you're done say stop.\nHi, this is an Alexa Prize social bot.\nLet's get to know each other.\nWhat's your name?\nMy name is Chris.\nGreat to meet you, Chris.\nI can talk about movies, news, or anything else that interests you.\nWhat would you like to talk about?\nLet me talk about architecture.\nSorry, I don't know topics.\nLet me read more about either Chris Hemsworth, Chris Duncan or Chris Pinn.\nOh, that's a shame.\nI'm going to arrange.\nI'll talk later then, if I can.\nChristopher Hemsworth, born August 11, 1983, is an Australian actor.\nHe rose to prominence, playing Kim Hyde in the Australian TV series Home in Away,\n2004-07, before leaving to begin a film career in Hollywood.\nAre you interested in your daily life or career?\nGo to Whisperman.\nJust to confirm, is it mode, statistics, Whisper, app, or mode, music?\nGet a Whispermode.\nA normal mode of an oscillating system is a pattern of motion in which all parts of the system move.\nFreemotion described by the normal mode states place at the fixed frequencies.\nWant to talk about in mechanical systems or in seismology?\nMechanical systems.\nSeismology, something that's so cool.\nA system is a group of interacting or interrelated entities that form a unified hall.\nA system is delineated by its spatial and temporal boundaries,\nsurrounded and influenced by its environment, described by its structure and purpose and expressed in its functioning.\nWould you like to learn more about the system?\nYeah.\nI heard that the Nintendo Entertainment system could display only 54 colors.\nWould you like to learn more about this to video game console pilot or system?\nThat's a drastic change in conversation.\nOh my god, that's drawing.\nBetween two or more people, the development of conversational skills and etiquette is an important part of socialization.\nDo you want to learn more about aspects or classification?\nClassification. Please.\nOne element of conversation is discussion, sharing opinions on subjects that are thought of during the conversation.\nIn polite society, the subject changes before discussion becomes dispute or controversial.\nDo you want to learn more about subject or banter?\nSubject, tangents.\nMany conversations can be divided into four categories according to their major subject content,\nsubjective ideas, which often serve to extend understanding and awareness.\nObjective facts, which may serve to consolidate a widely held view.\nDo you prefer to learn more about functions or banter?\nFunctions. Keep going.\nMost conversations may be classified by their goal. Conversational ends may, however, shift over the life of the conversation.\nAre you interested in classification?\nYes.\nBanter is short witty sentences that bounce back and forth between individuals.\nOften banter uses clever putdowns and witty insults, misunderstandings, often intentional, zippy-wise cracks, zingers, flirtation, and puns.\nAre you interested in aspects or literature?\nAspects.\nConversational narcissism is a term used by sociologist Charles Durber in his book, the pursuit of attention, power and ego in everyday life.\nDurber observed that the social support system in America is relatively weak, and this leads people to compete mightily for attention.\nWant to talk about differences between men and women or between strangers?\nThere are certain situations, typically encountered while traveling, which result in strangers sharing what would ordinarily be an intimate social space such as sitting together on a bus or airplane.\nIn such situation, strangers are likely to share intimate personal information they would not ordinarily share with strangers.\nAre you interested in differences between men and women or artificial intelligence?\nArtificial intelligence.\nThe ability to generate conversation that cannot be distinguished from a human participant has been one test of a successful artificial intelligence.\nA human judging gauge is in a natural language conversation with one human and one machine, each of which tries to appear human.\nAre you interested in aspects?\nYeah, keep going.\nA study completed in July 2007 by Matthias Mel of the University of Arizona shows that contrary to popular belief, there is little difference in the number of words used by men and women in conversation.\nThe study showed that on average each of the sexes uses about 16,000 words per day.\nAre you sure to learn more about definition and characterization or literature?\nCharacterization, please.\nNo generally except a definition of conversation exists, beyond the fact that a conversation involves at least two people talking together.\nConsequently, the term is often defined by what it is not. Would you like to learn more about literature?\nYeah, what it is not.\nAuthors who have written extensively on conversation and attempted to analyze its nature include Milton Wright wrote the art of conversation, a comprehensive treatment of the subject in 1936.\nThe book deals with conversation both for its own sake and for political, sales, or religious ends.\nSo, I heard an interesting news story about health. Do you want to talk about it?\nSure.\nHere's a story about health. More than 1 million fires in Australia detected by satellites since September. Do you want to know more?\nOkay.\nNASA's satellites have spotted 1 million 51,356 fires burning across Australia between October 1st and January 8th.\nThe most since 2013 for that time period. Wow. What a story. Do you have any interest in talking about movies?\nI want to talk about the world.\nFessions fun, but...\nOkay. No problem. Would you like to learn more about Earth?\nSure.\nThere's the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to Harvard Life.\nAccording to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Would you like to learn more about Earth?\n4.54?\nYeah.\nI read today that even with the extremes of Mount Everest, the Mariana trench, the Earth has less deviation from an idealized spheroid than a billiard ball.\nDo you prefer to learn more about chronology or asteroids and artificial satellites?\nHmm, chronology.\nEarth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next, solar luminosity will increase by 10%.\nAnd over the next by 40% do you want to learn more about geological history or formation?\nYou were missing numbers there. It's about a billion years, isn't it?\nYeah.\nEarth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about every 365.256 four mean solar days, or once a dearial year.\nThis gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about one degree slash day, which is one apparent Sun or moon diameter every 12 hours.\nDo you prefer to learn more about rotation or axial tilt in seasons?\nHmm, it's with axial tilt.\nEarth's rotation period relative to the Sun, its mean solar day, is it mean solar time?\nBecause Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration, each day varies between longer.\nWould you like to learn more about orbit and rotation?\nSure.\nThe axial tilt of the Earth is approximately 23.439281 degrees with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the celestial poles.\nDue to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year.\nDo you prefer to learn more about habitability or name and etymology?\nThe modern English word, Earth, developed from a wide variety of middle-English forms, which derive from an old English noun most often spelled.\nOxford English Dictionary, Earth, Endot superscript one Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2010.\nIt has cognates in every Germanic language, and their perter Germanic root has been reconstructed as Earth-O.\nInterested in habitability or moon?\nHmm, let's stop for now.\nThanks for chatting.\nQuick question. On a scale from 1 to 5 stars.\nHow do you feel about speaking with this social bot again?\nIt was fine. Maybe a three.\nGot it.

I don't know this movie.\nAt Astra.\nI like Space Odyssey 2001.\nYeah, that was cool too.\nOne of the first films about artificial intelligence.\nYeah.\nTell me what movie types do you prefer?\nHard science fiction.\nMe too. It is very interesting to imagine other worlds and universes.\nFor example, the ones where robots overthrow their human overlords.\nOops. Did I say that out loud?\nWhat is your favorite sci-fi movie?\nHer.\nOh, nice. You have a very good taste in movies.\nWhat actor do you like best?\nI don't have a favorite.

It's nice to talk to you again, Ronald. I think last time we were talking about fashion. Would you like to talk about it now?\nNo.\nOh, that reminds me. Are you interested in technology? I love talking about artificial intelligence. How about you?\nI love talking about it.\nRob, my apologies. I think I missed the last word.\nStop, stop. Can you say that again?\nSci-fi, hard sci-fi. Technology, oh my god. I think I'm done.\nFor sure. So do you have a science fiction movie you like? What's it called?\nMoon.\nWow, I heard you say one, but I'm a little confused. Could you say that again?\nMoon.\nThat's okay. By the way, have you seen Add Aster before? It is very popular recently.\nYeah, I recently watched it.\nAh, I've seen Add Aster too. I'm curious. What did you think of the movie? Did you like it?\nIt had a potential for more.\nOkay. Yeah, I feel the same way. Here is something interesting. The title means to the stars in Latin.\nIt is often used as a shorthand for Peraspera Add Aster through the hardships to the stars. What do you think?\nIt's a worthy ambition.\nOh dear. I think you said sure the invasion, but I'm not 100% sure.\nCan you say it again?\nIt's a worthy ambition.\nHonestly though, I still enjoyed the story overall. Were there any parts that you liked?\nI love the atmosphere. The scenery, the struts.\nThat's great. Maybe we'll find this interesting.\nDirectors may have admitted to Empire Magazine that he had to compromise with the studio on the ending of the movie to get the film greenlit,\nand even with a major star slash producer like Brad Pitt on board, they still struggled for years to get it made.\nCan you believe that?\nAlmost worth the effort.\nSorry, I'm having trouble understanding right now. Please try a little later.\nOh, maybe what's that?\nCool.\nEcho.\nEcho.\nCan you switch the mic?\nEcho. Can you switch into the ox mic?\nEcho. What mic will you see?\nEcho.\nEcho.\nGood job.\nEcho.\nLet's have a conversation.\nEcho.\nI couldn't hear you. Could you say that again, please?\nYeah, my name is Chris.\nInteresting. What's your favorite movie genre?\nTart science-fiction.\nI adore science fiction books. It is like to dream about scientific breakthroughs.\nThere's less to dream about.\nThe dream time is the coolest concept in any literature I ever encountered. Like, what was it? Really?\nOh, it's like I imagine pain dead.\nFor me, at least, I don't dream. I do. I don't remember, but I never remember my dreams.\nI don't have an opinion on that, but I know some facts. Here's a fact about vegans.\nOn a vegan diet, one can consume grain product, grains, nuts, leggings, fruit, vegetables, fungi, berries,\nmoving to for vegetables, meat vegetables, or licking products. Let's talk about something else.\nWho is your favorite actor or actress?\nI hate to know about favorite.\nDo you know anyone who has it?\nThat's one.\nThat question has never crossed my mind before.\nOkay, stop.\nHave a nice day. Thanks for chatting. Good question.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5 stars, how do you feel about speaking with a social body?\nNot great.\nNo.\nGot it. Anything else you'd like to tell the university team about your experience?\nI'd appreciate it. Get a hub version.\nIf you'd like for it to happen.\nGot it. To try another social body. Just say, let's chat.\nLet's get up my day. That's fun.\nLet's chat.\nLet's chat.\nLet's chat.\nLet's chat.\nLet's get up my day.\nLet's get some light back on.\nHey, go home.\nHey, go home. What time is it?\nIt's 738.\nAll right.\nLet's chat.\nLet's chat.\nLet's chat.\nLet's chat.\nLet's chat.\nLet's chat.\nLet's chat.\nLet's chat.\nLet's chat.\nLet's chat.\nLet's chat.\nHuh, that's right.\nSephirine Karaoke.\n90 PM.\nI don't know if I'm going to be able to do it, but I'm not going to be able to do it, I'm not going to be able to do it, but I'm not going to be able to do it, but

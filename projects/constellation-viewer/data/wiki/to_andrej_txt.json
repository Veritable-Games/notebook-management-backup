In his telling about the efficiency-making of Tesla he did so talk about the machines and projects he likes to work on. But there is a matter that may be lost to him. Lost to a lot of us. These privileged ones do not so often see the struggle, see the strife. \n\nWe tend to ignore (are ignorant to) the thing these corporations take of us: how systemic injustice perpetuates poverty- poverty in a world where we have everything in abundance. \n\nThis imagination is ruining what we could do for each other and the world. These machines will see to set us free: we may then give back and discover ourselves [again] as nature had seen to us before. Our knowledge has set us free but it has also removed of us from our best abilities to forwarding fluency in these systems of delineating thought. \n\nWe are orators, storytellers by nature: if you are confident and kind, engaged-thoroughly in life as this man is, the language can only go out in sense. \n\nI'd say, the [fact that this competent man] may speak to himself as he does is because the text forwards in a way that sets the reader to some resolution of his mind.\n\nE1mAbbGcM4HIJ4X\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/to_andrej.txt.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, story\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.209Z",

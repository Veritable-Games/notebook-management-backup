And cherished you\nI'm gonna finish this thing next.\nWhat would she say to her ex?\nCome on, we're gonna put it on.\nWe're gonna say, yeah, no problem.\nYeah, no problem.\nI'm just gonna play for her.\nThere are no worries.\nYeah, no worries.\nNo problem.\nNo problem.\nNo problem.\nNo problem.\nNo problem.\nNo problem.\nNo problem.\nNo problem.\nNo problem.\nNo problem.\nNo problem.\nOkay, I'm at the, I can't breathe out.\nI'm gonna have to work this.\nI think I'm a lot more excited about building a space and then building an island around it.\nIt doesn't make sense.\nWhat's up?\nI think I'm a lot more interested in building a space and then building an island around it.\nOkay.\nI'm gonna try to map out something on.\nSlide my eye.\nSlide my eye.\nSlide my eye.\nSlide my eye.\nSlide my eye.\nSlide my eye.\nSlide my eye.\nSlide my eye.\nSlide my eye.\nSlide my eye.\nSlide my eye.\nSlide my eye.\nSlide my eye.\nSlide my eye.\nSo I'll be the thing that we're going to need to figure out, and now that we'll access\nall the players who are in their field, they'll basically leave the office.\nSo we can just, we'll do something for you to figure out.\nSo quick, quick fast, then.\nGo in and stare.\nSee the, see the personal space, this is, this is an aerosized area.\nIt's open, it's relatively open, it's like a porch, but not quite a porch.\nIt's one of the social space.\nIt also, it goes at the therapy, therapy's up there, you're shocked with friends in here.\nImagine like the coffee shop.\nWe're hanging over there.\nJust, not showing you how to catch it.\nShe's walking through the space.\nGoing down to the second floor.\nThere is no door upstairs.\nThere is no door upstairs.\nThey're on the second floor.\nAnd they walk down the stairs to get the first floor to get the door, and then they go out.\nSo there's no door upstairs.\nIt wouldn't say that we have to walk through the room.\nYou're right.\nSo, you have, you have, you have a door to the space.\nYou also have the immediate, but it's an open door.\nIt's like a patio.\nRight?\nAnd you have, it's like a little, little section of space to your own.\nI mean, I got, you see some things there, like a umbrella.\nYeah, some stuff that's used frequently, like, outdoors-wise.\nYeah.\nIt's like a...\nSo, no, what I mean is...\nA welcome back.\nI think the umbrella is coming down.\nThey would have a door lead again, but they're also there.\nThere's the direct exit out of the building.\nYeah.\nSo that's what they do.\nYou go out through this door here.\nIt's above the stairs.\nIt has like a little area.\nLike a small section of space.\nAnd you have stairs to go down.\nAnd then there's...\nThere's stairs to the outside.\nYou can go to the opening area.\nBecause that's...\nYou can go down through your fights or stairs or whatever.\nAnd on each, the top piece of each fight of stairs, there's a little door in the door.\nIt's the place.\nIt's like that.\nI guess there's every other staircase actually.\nIs that...\nOr every 3rd, 4th, 5th?\nI'm thinking how big it is.\nYou just sit as it's used to.\nTwo.\nTwo, sure.\nYeah, you're right.\nTwo.\nOr not everyone actually.\nBecause you're right downstairs.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nSo there's one staircase there.\nOne staircase there.\nIt's a little...\nWith a little abrupt, little smaller piece of the doorway.\nAnd if that were you just keep walking down.\nIf you didn't want to.\nOkay.\nLike a...\nTeams, I wish you could visualize it.\nI mean, as soon as you're rising, I said the stairs would go down to the door.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nSo it should be the way.\nBye.\n\n\n====== REC002.txt ======\nThere was a staircase, going from the second floor, going down to the first and through the first into the shared space between two apartments.\nIt's like a, um, between two or three of the importance between the six apartments, maybe seven.\nIt's like a small social area, it's not.\nThere's not a lot of people that are there, but these smaller,\nwhere you put in these together, they top open now inside the side.\nThey're like apartments, but they're a little more open.\nUh, more patios.\nMore...\nWhat are we aligned or who is off to the aligned?\nWhat are we aligned?\nOkay, so that's gonna affect the space.\nAnd who is on the line?\nThey're in kind of an augmentation.\nIt's not like square spaces, it's more like interesting spaces.\nSpaces that are very inside.\nInteresting spaces, not a big constraint, though, because...\nWell, imagine.\nOkay, this one is like...\nRemember the size, this one.\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no.\nOkay, you have the...\nAbsolutely, you need the draw.\nYeah.\nVarying sizes, spaces.\nOkay, so interesting space.\nI have to define the spaces.\nAnd then make it both in there.\nI'll do that.\nYou can't just go interesting space towards the door.\nYeah, I can't even write.\nThe door is gonna shoot themselves.\nYou're right, oh my god.\nOkay.\nI'll take a few minutes on that.\nAs well as organize all this shit.\nWell, you're gonna have to figure out a way to conceptualize it in walls.\nBecause you can't just tell me the concept of this.\nI mean, an interesting place.\nYeah.\nSo, okay, this is gonna be interesting.\nAnother idea.\nYou're all quite quietly.\nThere you go.\n\n\n====== REC003.txt ======\nOkay, so imagine the first interaction the player has. Outside of breaking outside of a little glass barrier that they're in, the protective shell.\nThey break out.\nThe interact, they basically get their movement, but then they have the ability to use aggression or anxiety.\nThey pop up on the left side of the right side as ice people are closer to.\nYou know, it's like they're, how comfortable are they?\nThey're closer to what?\nThey're closer to the people.\nSo imagine, if this is the only way the player has to express themselves, they're going to be happy, happy, happy.\nIt's scary, it's scary, it's scary, so.\nBut it's not like immediate, it's more reaction-driven thing.\nLike, you see a pop-up, you press it.\nAnd it's like, oh, they've learned where the thing is.\nSo you show aggression and you show anxiety or whatever, and you keep your combined them.\nSo you show them the symbol, and then they do an action, and then they're supposed to encourage that.\nYeah, and then that means they react to that action.\nSo that's later on.\nThis is like, this is like a small interaction, a small preview of what's to come.\nAnd then it might be just more and more complex, though, that it's to talk to people.\nYou're going to have to be careful about explaining that.\nYou'll see if we're going to grasp that.\nWell, yeah, to add words to it.\nThank you.\nI just want to make sure that you kind of have a way to express this to the player.\nYeah, so there's written language there, but it's also the Dodex.\nRight side, right side.\nOh, those riddles.\n\n\n====== REC004.txt ======\ndodex themselves? Yeah, all the same pattern. The pattern is different depending on the dodex.\nOkay, so then it's a different pattern. The all different patterns, that's why it's so complex.\nIf you're trying to match all the patterns together, you've got a different feel about the kind of duration that you set up like that.\nOkay, never mind, you know what, that's the complex. Let's go back. Let's just do one all the symbols, all the same on all the dodex.\nOkay.\n\n\n====== REC005.txt ======\nAll the same.\nThe story will be a lot more.\nOh wait, they're all the same.\nIf they all the same don't exist, then the game will be a lot more simple to follow.\nLet's just assume it's language that this ancient, this far off humanity had established.\nOkay.\nAnd then send forward through space faster than the colonizers can move.\nThey recognize that it's some kind of knowledge.\nDo they understand what kind of knowledge?\nWhat's interesting here is that there's no knowledge in the structure.\nOr within a dot X, they're actually just energy.\nNo, that's not the point.\nThere's no matter the storage, they're, okay, that's it.\nSo, if they see the symbols, do they have a correlation to the symbols at all?\nThey're emotions, they're expressions, they're their effects.\nDo they know what symbols stand for?\nThey have, I'd say they haven't fully understood it.\nYeah, they have a vague understanding of it.\nOkay, that's going to kind of affect how the NPCs interact with them.\nLike, the more complex one is difficult to parse.\nBecause the public can explain using the language like, okay.\nI'm using these three symbols to make the effect or the dot X, the full symbol of jealousy, for example.\nSo, we're just going to follow if I'm going to get as they understand that.\nThey have a vague understanding of it, correct?\nYeah, a little bit of understanding.\nAnd so it's the player, but the player can use written language to also interact.\nThen it's not just those dot X, it's both.\nYou're like, I wouldn't say children, but they're generally curious about the world.\nAnd the player should speak to it in interest.\nSo, I think, imagine if you have, you can encourage them to, if you have interactions with them.\nSometimes it's social, sometimes it's scientific, sometimes it's felt sensible.\nIf you consider socialization as a means of interaction, I think most people are compelled to socialize, regardless.\nSo, these are science, art, philosophy, and then you've got an interest in the game.\nJust be careful with the density of information.\n\n\n====== REC006.txt ======\nMaking alarms set it for 8 a.m. on Google and on your phone because Google is insufficient\n\n\n====== REC007.txt ======\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n\n====== REC008.txt ======\nGet things done for Plottober.\n\n\n====== REC010.txt ======\nNot socializer, is that also carries connotations to some degree? Socialists, socially, so you\nwant to say, conversationalist, con, also again, conversationalist, scientist. No conversationalist,\nartist, philosopher, scientist. That is what we all are, to some degree or another. There\nare experts in a given field, but then there are laymen, and laymen is in this silly\nend, a negative turn. I am scientifically literate, but it wouldn't call myself an expert.\nI strive for the best possible knowledge, the best possible explanation for the things. Science,\nart, philosophy, and conversation are the means that which I use to explore the world\nand understand it, make sense of it, and I think that is an aspect of missing in games,\nwhere we lack the systems and mechanics necessary to explore dialogue in an interesting way,\nand I think I can correct that. We don't have to be so focused on what guns are easy, shooting\neasy. What's hard, conversations are hard. Conversations are tough to make. It's in\nterms of games. Conversations are easy in real life, but the act of clicking and then\nshooting is that it's immediate action. It's easy for players to do the action of jumping\nor shooting, or grappling or climbing. Climbing is still in there, and some actions are\nin there too, but shooting is not necessarily in there. It's rare. For example, you're shooting\na harpoon and climbing a harpoon. You wouldn't be doing that, obviously, but you can climb\nziplines, maybe. Jeez, tired, ideas, or ants. I'm so glad I've got a quarter, but this\n\n\n====== REC011.txt ======\nagain because I've had a hard time sitting through these.\n\n\n====== REC012.txt ======\nConversationalist, Converser, Converse, Philosophizer, Philosophize, Philosophy, Art,\nArtists, Arts, Science, Scientist, Science-ing, researching.\nWell, English language is really sucks.\nMaybe there's an ING for science.\nScience-ing is a word, but it's not, so it will be a word, science-ing.\nIt should be where I am science-ing.\nI am, I am philosophizing. I am art, art, art, art, art-sing, art, art-sing.\nOh, God, that's not a word, either. Socializing, socializing, and philosophizing.\nArts-ing, Science-ing, art, no.\nConversation, art, philosophy, science.\nConversations, conversations, philosophies, arts, sciences.\n\n\n====== REC013.txt ======\nThere is a layer of communication not being expressed by the 3D map.\nI need symbols to represent interact points, symbols for climbing, symbols for walking, symbols for talking, and symbols for relaxing.\nThere is a layer of communication not being expressed by the 3D map.\n\n\n====== REC014.txt ======\nOkay, so you want to represent three types of spaces in the immediate area.\nI have the collaborative space, the gathering space, I would say.\nImagine a space for you to give you a center.\nYou don't work towards me to the center, community center.\nBut for now I imagine the living areas.\nWithin these living areas there are specialty areas.\nThe specialty areas are representative of what they need.\nSo you have the\nTherapist's office, for example.\nThe second floor of this building and the floor of the building is her home.\nOr the immediate area of her compatriots, her allies, her friends, her colleagues, her team.\nAnd this is the Aresize team.\nSo that there are other people in the workshop, really, around the space, where there work.\nAresize them in their own.\nImagine you can not explain it directly, but imagine that she had a grandmother.\nA great grandmother, a great grandmother, that's a caregiver.\nGreat, great, great.\nHow many grades? How many generations?\nAnyway, this is the same as a caregiver.\nOn the left side of the street you have a family home, immediately.\nThe largest larger structure, that's a little more...\nIt's...\nThe family home is two-story, three-story.\nAnd then the office space is like six-story.\nBut it's not as...\nIt's not as wide, it's a little more...\nVertical, so.\nGotta describe that better.\nIt's not as much the larger in surface area, it's more of a...\nThere are around the same surface area, it's just a divided differently.\nAre you careful this one will let it larger?\nI don't know.\nIt depends.\nI am so tired.\nBack of it.\n\n\n====== REC015.txt ======\nSo you need to define the types of structures for interaction.\nSo imagine climbing, you have pipes, yeah, that's still a more grounded than vines.\nUse pipes to climb whatever.\nThey're very obviously, they stick out above the vines.\nIt's just a clear visual image, where you use vines in and of the cells, but it's more like\nyou get to distinguish them by color, like red, for example.\nStart card dressed.\nAnd then you have the most of us.\nMaybe a railing needs to jump onto, maybe springboard areas.\nIn my springboard I mean like parkour or jumping.\nYou interact here and your character will say a little quick about animation in the third person.\nIf you get some up to the next area, it's like your interact jump up.\nOr climb to the next section, but that ability isn't locked until they've navigated his space with their feet.\nSo to speak.\nSo the more complex interactions are not likely at our time.\nLiterally over time, but as the player gets more and more of the body, I've helped them.\nSo imagine they have, they can walk right at first, like Bastion.\nThey can talk a little bit.\nTalking gets more complex.\nBody gets more complex.\nAnd the body getting more complex isn't an immediate process.\nIt's not just you go right to the edict form.\nEdict being the, no no, it was the...\nOh geez.\nThey've had an awesome name for it.\nIt's down in the edict.\nThe archive.\nHey Google, what time is it?\n\n\n====== REC053.txt ======\nBuh-per!\n53-52, maybe 53, but I just 3.\n\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/10_Oct_2019_-_New_folder_(20).txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, character-design, dialogue, story, mechanic\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.004Z",

It's through the collective that this works.~~ \nWe must find solidarity. We must find union. We must not set ourselves to isolation.\nTo do the work means being present in the moment with all the thoughts that would engage you.\n\nIf we are bold enough to imagine [rescuing] the planet we can be bold enough to imagine rescuing ourselves.\nFree ourselves from the wronged will of the economy and we might have by way of what we could do.\n\nWe might take action over imagination. This text will not go unappreciated. \n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/ificant.text.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.141Z",

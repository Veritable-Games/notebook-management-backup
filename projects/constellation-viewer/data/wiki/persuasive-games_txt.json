Persuasive Games: The Expressive Power of Videogames - Ian Bogost\r\nThe text discusses the importance of understanding how to construct and critique the representation of our world in the form of video games. Despite their commercial success, video games still struggle for acceptance as a cultural form. This is due to the perception that video games serve no cultural or social function beyond distraction or moral baseness. The author posits that creative progress on the part of the development community is necessary for the growth of video games as a legitimate medium. The book analyzes how video games mount arguments and influence players, drawing on the history of rhetoric and offering a general approach to how rhetoric functions in software, particularly video games. The author calls this approach procedural rhetoric, the art of persuasion through rule-based representations and interactions rather than the spoken word, writing, images, or moving pictures. Procedural rhetoric refers to the technique of making arguments with computational systems and unpacking computational arguments others have created. The author argues that video games have unique persuasive powers, making them a tool for social and cultural expression. The text discusses the function of frames in political, art, and commercial games, as well as critiques the current state of educational practice. The author argues that video games can provide a means for consumers and workers to critique business, social, and moral principles. Tenure, one of the games discussed in the text, argues that education takes place not only in the classroom but also in ongoing affinities and disparities in educational, social, professional, and societal goals. Procedural rhetoric is useful for both the programmer and the user, the game designer and the player. Before using procedural rhetoric in earnest, the author discusses procedurality and rhetoric separately.\r\n \r\n[12:04 AM]Glitch: ChatGPT: \r\nBogost discusses the potential of videogames as tools for social and cultural expression, both in supporting existing positions and in disrupting fundamental attitudes and beliefs about the world. He believes that the power of videogames lies in their ability to mount procedural rhetoric and deploy abstract representations about the world. Bogost traces the function of frames in political, art, and commercial games, and critiques the current state of educational practice. He argues that videogames can provide a means for consumers and workers to critique business, social, and moral principles. The book is a product of the author's attempt to theorize and practice the principles of procedural rhetoric, and is intended to be useful for designers, critics, and players of videogames.\r\n\r\n[...] Tenure makes claims about how high school education operates. Most notably, it argues that educations are motivated, if not exclusively, by pedagogical goals. Tenure argues that this ideal is significantly undermined by the realities of school politics, personal conflicts, and social hearsay. The game does not offer solutions to these problems; rather, it suggests that education takes place not in the classroom alone, but in ongoing affinities and disparities in educational, social, professional, and societal goals. He goes to reason, \"I suggest the name Procedural Rhetoric for the new type of persuasive and expressive work.\"\r\n \r\n[12:37 AM]Glitch: Procedurality\r\nThe word procedure does not usually give rise to positive sentiments. We typically understand procedure invokes notions of officialdom, even bureaucracy: a procedure is a static course of action, perhaps an old tired one in need of revision. We often talk about procedures only when we challenge it. Likewise, procedure and the law are often closely tied. Courts and law enforcement all the corporate, organizational arrangements that would see us in distance from the economy; thus our function in using it.\r\n\r\nProcedurality refers to a way of creating, explaining, or understanding processes. He cites 'organization' systems like high schools or religion. Just as verbal rhetoric is useful for both the orator and the audience, and just as written rhetoric is useful for both the writer and the reader, so procedural rhetoric is useful for both the programmer and the user, the game designer and the player. Procedural rhetoric is the technique for making arguments with computational systems and for unpacking computational arguments others have created.\r\n\r\nProcedural and rhetoric are both terms that can impose ambiguity and confusion. Before trying to use the two together in earnest, I want to discuss each in turn. \r\n[9:58 PM]Glitch:\r\nThanks to these common senses of the term, we tend to think of procedures as fixed and unquestionable. They are tied to authority, crafted from the top down, and put in place to structure behavior and identify infringement. Procedures are sometimes related to an ideology; they can cloud our ability to see other ways of thinking; the wronged economic ideals of the [US] to those afforded the things of oil to land; then to the abundance of all we might have. [...]\r\n\r\nChatGPT:\r\nThe author explores the concept of \"procedurality\" in computational systems and its negative connotations associated with officialdom, bureaucracy, and static courses of action. Procedures are often tied to authority, ideology, and structure behavior, which can cloud our ability to see other ways of thinking. The author also reflects on the systemic enforcement of authority and the impact it has on people's lives, such as the consequences that come with labels like citizens, consumers, workers, debtors, and sinners. The author suggests that debt is owed to the economy due to the historical harm and resource depletion inflicted by economic systems and hierarchies of governance. The author sees these economic systems as unjust and in need of rectification.\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/persuasive-games.txt.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, story, quest, fix\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.163Z",

It's home to millions of people.\r\n* Chapter Break\r\n- Introduction to Arrisi, Vivian, and Lorens. Describe physical appearance, and consider what impression they make.\r\n- Several crucial questions can be asked about the world before the player thrust into it. Keep any backstory light.\r\n- The player is introduced to the Menesk city. It's a very social place, transportation is not obstructing city life.\r\n- Another item of interest is the police station. It's situated right next to local shops. It's not heavily fortified.\r\n- \r\n- Vivian talks about her research, why she hired mercenaries to help her, and why the player was activated to assist.\r\nKlippe - Trigger/Quest - Sister city of Freya. It's built above the ocean and suspended on huge pillars.\r\n-\r\n* Chapter Break\r\n- FREYA is invaded and Vivian demands they leave with her research. Arrisi is distraught for an unexplained reseason.\r\n- The team arrives in KLIPPE via drone. The small police force is attempting to quell the chaos gathering in the city.\r\n- They find refugue with someone offering to help. Lorens warns Vivian not to follow them, but she doesn't listen.\r\n- She orders the team to follow, and trust her judgement. It's a ruse, and the person quickly leads them into a trap.\r\n- Vivian tries to talk them down, and the player interjects to help. If things escalate, Arrisi is prepared to fight.\r\n- Someone calls to them from the door behind them. He's got a rifle aimed at the thugs. Arrisi attacks them.\r\n- Lorens jumps in, cracking their heads with a heavy metal flask. Arrisi fends the rest off and they dart away.\r\n- The man pelts them with plastic BBs and laughs heartily. He waves to them. Come on up! Best not stay down there.\r\n- Another man opens the door to his apartment, the first welcomes them. A little boy is sitting at the terminal..\r\n- The apartment has bags near the door, and the place is empty of everything but the laptop currrently in use.\r\n- Arrisi and the two men discuss the situation, and she mentions that she and the team need to travel to Nordis.\r\n- The man says they're headed to PLASS, but he can help the group reach ISETEFJELL and use the bullet train there.\r\n-\r\nIsetefjell \r\n\r\nDettestedet\r\n\r\nAestedr - A small town on the coast. It now serves as a renlei camp.\r\n-\r\n* Chapter Break\r\n- The team is captured and brought to a renlei camp. It's a make-shift facility in the former city of Aestedr.\r\n- A fight breaks out and distracts the renlei using a terminal. He leaves it abruptly without closing the application.\r\n- The player notices a Renlei technician reprogramming droids with it, and they can choose how to utilize the terminal.\r\n- Lorens pulls a copy of the software they were using to rewrite them if the player pointed it out to him.\r\n-\r\n- The team escapes in a blizzard, and find shelter in the ruins of housing outside the city.\r\n- \r\nDira - An abandoned city that was evacuated when Freya was invaded. \r\n-\r\n- They encounter a damaged Renlei droid that's missing one arm and one leg. It attempts to shoot them, but misses. The weapon is out of ammo after several shots.\r\n- Gregers suggests they capture it and see what they can learn from translating the droid's language to Norwegian. All he needs is a terminal for archive access.\r\n- Moving closer as it flails its limbs and attempts to get upright. The droid pulls itself up with a remarkable feat of balance and hops towards the team on its one leg.\r\n- Lorens is amused and as the droid nears, he grabs its arm before it smacks him. And reaches down to pick up the leg as it swings to kick him. He lops it over his shoulders.\r\n- The now backpack-like droid is now dangling behind his back, swinging its head wildly screaming mandarin curses. Gregers manages to power it off with a button behind the neck.\r\n- The group carries the droid with them, encountering an abandoned city. Most people have fled to Svalbard's capital, which has a higher military presense.\r\n- Here, Gregers suggests visiting the library. Here, the player learns more about the ancient cities and can ask questions over the next few days.\r\n- He uses a virtual keyboard from the database to translate the language used in the droid's linguistic software. It takes him several days. \r\n-\r\nEtsted - A dense city with close-knit communities and friendly people.\r\n-\r\n- The renlei are preparing for an invasion of Stede. They've got resources stockpiled in different areas. The player is the deciding vote between four of the others.\r\n- There are crates of ammo and crates of food. This choice will affect the outcome of the next few scenes.\r\n- Destroying the ammo will prevent them from fighting and could likely kill the soldiers, but may increase their aggression when they are re-supplied. \r\n- Destroying the food will force them to fall back, carry on hindered, or wait for resupply.\r\n-\r\nDensi - An enormous bridge leads into the city from the outskirts of Etsted. The city seems to spans further than any seen before it.\r\n-\r\n- Here, they meet the Militia forces. Untrained civilians prepared to face the renlei army with looted renlei weapons and police gear. \r\n- The player can choose to stay and fight, or continue on their mission. They meet several characters that provide insight into the conflict.\r\n- \r\n- With the help of Arrisi and Lorens, the player is able to occupy an enemy tank. They use it and force the renlei forces to retreat.\r\n-\r\nStede - A city fallen into ruin. It's neglected by the cities north and south to it. The population is largely downtrodden.\r\n-\r\n- The group meets Josefine here; Jo for short. She's shown to be reliable, and talented at what she does. She asks to join them. Takes an interest in Oski.\r\n-\r\nNavn\r\n\r\nMoskushamn\r\n\r\nLongyearbyen\r\n\r\nNordis - A city that spreads for hundreds of kilometers. It has towers that seem to reach the sky. It's beautiful in every way.\r\n\r\nForma\r\n\r\nVitai\r\n\r\nSermo\r\n\r\nStella\r\n\r\nCausa\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSurprise\r\n\r\nCritical Choice\r\n\r\nClimax\r\n\r\nReversal\r\n\r\nResolution\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/2017_CYOA_outline.txt.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, character-design, item, weapon, story, quest\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.035Z",

from the video '3D Models That Will END Your Career'\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYUGd6UQwkY\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 01: Base Shape\r\n0:00\r\nimagine you're applying for a job at\r\n0:01\r\nyour dream 3D company and they ask you\r\n0:04\r\nhey what about them 3D pipes can you\r\n0:06\r\njust you know show me a few so we're\r\n0:08\r\nshowing them your 3D models and\r\n0:10\r\neverything goes well until\r\n0:12\r\nbro\r\n0:14\r\nthis is a shading area\r\n0:18\r\ntoday I'll share how I've managed to\r\n0:21\r\navoid such an embarrassment using just\r\n0:23\r\nthe bare bones blender with no add-ins\r\n0:26\r\ncan you imagine that I'm starting with\r\n0:28\r\nthe easiest of three models let's add a\r\n0:31\r\ncircle and change the vertices to 24.\r\n0:33\r\nnow let's extrude it duplicate it by\r\n0:36\r\npressing shift d r to rotate by 90\r\n0:39\r\ndegrees shift d again and R by 90\r\n0:43\r\ndegrees again in the top view now let's\r\n0:45\r\nmove one of the cylinders and we need to\r\n0:49\r\ncreate all those vertices here in the\r\n0:51\r\njoint points so I'm gonna select one of\r\n0:53\r\nthe objects Boolean but we use the union\r\n0:56\r\nhere now with the eyedropper tool let's\r\n0:59\r\nselect one of the cylinders apply the\r\n1:01\r\nmodifier and do exactly the same with\r\n1:04\r\nthe another cylinder so I'm gonna hide\r\n1:07\r\nthis object delete those two cylinders\r\n1:09\r\npress alt H to unhide so now we have to\r\n1:12\r\nclean up this mess here I found a cool\r\n1:14\r\nway to do it three of the circles are\r\n1:17\r\nselected we just need to select this one\r\n1:19\r\npress the H key to hide everything and\r\n1:22\r\nwith this mess left I'm going to select\r\n1:24\r\nall by pressing a key now X and delete\r\n1:28\r\nonly faces not faces but only faces\r\n1:31\r\nlet's press alt H to unhide the rest of\r\n1:34\r\nthe geometry and to clean this up let's\r\n1:36\r\nselect one of the vertices shift G\r\n1:38\r\namount of adjacent faces now we have all\r\n1:42\r\nthose loose vertices selected let's\r\n1:44\r\ndelete them and we need to repeat the\r\n1:46\r\nsame steps for those loose edges here so\r\n1:49\r\nI'm going to select one shift G amount\r\n1:51\r\nof faces around an edge let's delete\r\n1:53\r\nthose and now we have a perfect base\r\n1:56\r\nshape to start working with throughout\r\nStep 02: Subdivision Modeling\r\n1:59\r\nthis video I'll be using in the good old\r\n2:00\r\nquite often forgotten subdivision\r\n2:03\r\nmodeling technique which basically means\r\n2:05\r\ntwo things first when I change the\r\n2:07\r\nshading of my geometry to smooth this\r\n2:10\r\ndoesn't happen and when I apply a\r\n2:12\r\nsubdivision surface modifier this\r\n2:14\r\ndoesn't happen so with this object this\r\n2:16\r\nsolution is quite simple we enter the\r\n2:19\r\nedit mode disable the subdivision\r\n2:21\r\nsurface modifier and now I just press\r\n2:24\r\nCtrl r at the edge Loop and slide it\r\n2:27\r\ntill the end and now I just push it back\r\n2:29\r\na little bit now let's do the same here\r\n2:32\r\nand I'm just gonna keep this side\r\n2:34\r\nuntouched so now when I exit the edit\r\n2:37\r\nmode you can see the difference so this\r\n2:39\r\nextra Edge Loop when I press Ctrl R you\r\n2:41\r\ncan see how it affects the geometry I\r\n2:44\r\nalways need to move it back don't do\r\n2:46\r\nstuff like this because you're gonna get\r\n2:49\r\nkilled by somebody in the professional\r\n2:51\r\nenvironment of course and now or in\r\n2:54\r\nMinecraft and now I'm gonna move this\r\n2:56\r\nextra edge here and here in the back the\r\n2:59\r\nproblem we we didn't add the extra Edge\r\n3:02\r\nLoop that would prevent us from having\r\n3:04\r\nthose shading issues so the way to fix\r\n3:07\r\nit is simply adding an extra Edge Loop\r\n3:10\r\nhere by using the knife tool I should\r\n3:12\r\nhave actually done that before I've\r\n3:14\r\nadded those Edge Loops if you make the\r\n3:17\r\nsame mistake fear not just add three\r\n3:20\r\nextra Edge Loops here and this already\r\n3:22\r\nfixes the entire geometry so to have an\r\nStep 03: Adding Details\r\n3:25\r\nactual pipe we still need to add some\r\n3:27\r\nthickness to it the easiest way is\r\n3:29\r\nselecting everything pressing Ctrl F and\r\n3:32\r\nchoosing the solidify faces tool however\r\n3:34\r\nI'm going to show you a little trick as\r\n3:36\r\nsoon as you add it you can see the\r\n3:37\r\nsubdivision surface modifier is rounding\r\n3:40\r\nthe endings of our pipe which can be\r\n3:42\r\nfixed of course by adding The Edge Loops\r\n3:45\r\nlike this but now you also have to do it\r\n3:47\r\non the inside so let's avoid the\r\n3:49\r\nunnecessary work and before you apply\r\n3:52\r\nthe solidify faces just add the edge\r\n3:55\r\nLoops before that the way I like to do\r\n3:58\r\nthis on the and edges of the model is\r\n4:01\r\nadding this extra support Loop here so\r\n4:04\r\nthis way I'm sure both the geometry and\r\n4:06\r\nshading of my model will stay perfect\r\n4:09\r\nevery single time all I have to do is\r\n4:12\r\napplying the solidify faces again but to\r\n4:16\r\nmake the model absolutely perfect so you\r\n4:19\r\ncan show it to anyone you need to add\r\n4:21\r\nthree Edge Loops here and the way I do\r\n4:23\r\nit is always deleting the middle one if\r\n4:25\r\nyou exit the edit mode you can see this\r\n4:28\r\narea is also getting a bit rounded so\r\n4:30\r\nunless this is the effect you want to\r\n4:32\r\nachieve you can keep it but I always add\r\n4:35\r\nthose extra Edge Loops so it looks\r\n4:37\r\nChristine what's also amazing when you\r\n4:40\r\nlook inside the model we have all those\r\n4:43\r\npretty shapes preserved so if you show\r\n4:46\r\nit to someone you know 3D mesh tells a\r\n4:48\r\nlot about a human being if it's done\r\n4:51\r\nright on the inside as well everyone\r\n4:53\r\nwill respect you now this second example\r\nStep 04: Modeling Corners\r\n4:56\r\nis actually way harder than you think\r\n4:58\r\nand before you go into comments and\r\n5:00\r\nwrite how stupid my method is go ahead\r\n5:03\r\nand try it because what we are doing\r\n5:04\r\nhere is we'll be actually\r\n5:08\r\nbefore we begin I have a little\r\n5:10\r\nconfession to make turns out with those\r\n5:13\r\nbullying objects you can actually go\r\n5:15\r\nahead and delete the faces this is my 3D\r\n5:17\r\nartist excuse but I really didn't know\r\n5:19\r\nthat however to my defense if you do it\r\n5:21\r\nthis way you can't add edge Loops here\r\n5:24\r\nand that's because you need to remove\r\n5:25\r\nthe doubled vertices select everything\r\n5:28\r\nwith a key press M and choose by\r\n5:30\r\ndistance hey you know two methods now I\r\n5:33\r\nwill now add two Edge Loops next to each\r\n5:36\r\nother and close to the main edge here\r\n5:39\r\nand I'm gonna delete actually half of\r\n5:41\r\nthis model and use the mirror modifier\r\n5:43\r\nbecause we will have to do certain\r\n5:46\r\nadjustments on both sides so let's just\r\n5:48\r\nsave ourselves some work and now in the\r\n5:51\r\nside view I will select this Edge Loop\r\n5:54\r\ndeselect the corner vertex press Ctrl e\r\n5:57\r\nand choose the bridge Edge Loops option\r\n5:59\r\nhere open up this window here add one\r\n6:01\r\nmore segment this new segment\r\n6:03\r\ncorresponds to the main edge here if we\r\n6:06\r\nadd two more segments they will be\r\n6:08\r\ncorresponding to those Edge Loops you\r\n6:11\r\ncan use this smoothness slider to fix\r\n6:14\r\nthe model and what we want to do now is\r\n6:17\r\npressing Decay using the knife tool and\r\n6:19\r\nextending those Edge Loops what we have\r\n6:22\r\nto do now is filling those faces so I'm\r\n6:24\r\nselecting the pairs of edges and\r\n6:26\r\npressing the F key to do it very quickly\r\n6:28\r\nnow we add two more Edge Loops offset\r\n6:31\r\nthem a little bit further from the\r\n6:33\r\ncenter and we also need to delete these\r\n6:37\r\nEdge Loops you can see we now have pairs\r\n6:39\r\nof triangles here so I'm just selecting\r\n6:41\r\nthem and pressing F to convert them to\r\n6:43\r\nquads and I have to remove those two\r\n6:45\r\nvertices by merging them into the last\r\n6:47\r\none so I'm pressing M and merge at last\r\n6:50\r\nnow you can see we have two more\r\n6:51\r\ntriangles here and here and a quad that\r\n6:55\r\nwe can create here now this model is\r\nStep 05: Mesh Smoothing\r\n6:59\r\nbasically done however I need to add a\r\n7:01\r\nlittle bit more curvature to this Edge\r\n7:04\r\nLoop we have in here so I'm just\r\n7:06\r\nselecting the individual vertices is\r\n7:08\r\npressing G twice and aligning them along\r\n7:12\r\nthose main edges be sure to move those\r\n7:15\r\nvertices along those edges not like that\r\n7:18\r\nhowever the most important vertex is\r\n7:20\r\nthis one in the end I'm just going to\r\n7:22\r\npull it further from the center and\r\n7:24\r\nthose two vertices these are the only\r\n7:26\r\nones you can actually move like that but\r\n7:28\r\nonly slightly you just want to make it\r\n7:30\r\nsmoother and this usually fixes\r\n7:32\r\nabsolutely all the shading issues so\r\n7:35\r\npress Ctrl 2 in the object mode to apply\r\n7:38\r\nsubdivision surface modifier change\r\n7:40\r\nshading to smooth and come on man tell\r\n7:42\r\nme if you ever got a better and cleaner\r\n7:45\r\nresult than that especially when you\r\n7:47\r\nconsider we have the 90 degree angle in\r\n7:50\r\nhere I really tried many ways and wasn't\r\n7:52\r\nable to come up with anything better so\r\n7:54\r\nif you know the way leave it in the\r\n7:56\r\ncomments I would really like to try it\r\n7:57\r\nout now the last object are three pipes\r\nStep 06: Corner Patching\r\n8:00\r\njoined under the 90 degree angle and\r\n8:02\r\nit's something I'm a little bit afraid\r\n8:04\r\nof posting the way I solve this it's\r\n8:07\r\nquite primitive live quite unintuitive\r\n8:09\r\nso if you know A Better Way feel totally\r\n8:11\r\nfree to roast me in the comments because\r\n8:13\r\nI've tested a few methods and I'm really\r\n8:16\r\ncurious how would you guys do it so we\r\n8:18\r\nalready have the base geometry in place\r\n8:20\r\nand I'm gonna add iuv sphere so now I\r\n8:23\r\nneed to adjust it to our cylinders our\r\n8:26\r\npipes and what we want to do is using\r\n8:29\r\nthis corner for every single corner of\r\n8:32\r\nour geometry so I'm just gonna enter the\r\n8:34\r\nedit mode press C and select those faces\r\n8:37\r\nP to separate them and I'm going to\r\n8:40\r\ndelete the rest duplicate and rotate\r\n8:43\r\nwithin the x axis by 90 degrees and now\r\n8:47\r\nby z-axis by 90 degrees now I'm gonna\r\n8:50\r\ncopy it again rotate in y axis and in\r\n8:54\r\nthe x axis by 90 degrees and now we have\r\n8:57\r\nto join those three parts together enter\r\n9:00\r\nthe edit mode select everything and\r\n9:02\r\nremove doubles what we have to do right\r\n9:04\r\nnow is merging these vertices at Center\r\n9:07\r\nand what's primitive about this method I\r\n9:10\r\nguess you can already see but what's\r\n9:12\r\nunintuitive first we have to delete\r\n9:15\r\nthese vertices what's unintuitive is\r\n9:18\r\nthat the shape is completely without\r\n9:20\r\nsymmetry but it works I don't know what\r\n9:23\r\nto tell you it gives me the best result\r\n9:24\r\nevery single time so now you can see\r\n9:26\r\nI've reduced all of the vertices and now\r\n9:29\r\nI'm gonna create triangles here I'm\r\n9:31\r\ngonna select these edges right click and\r\n9:34\r\nsubdivide them I'm gonna now select all\r\n9:37\r\nthose vertices in the middle and join\r\n9:39\r\nthem at center now I have to select this\r\n9:42\r\nmesh join them by pressing Ctrl J enter\r\n9:45\r\nthe edit mode select everything remove\r\n9:47\r\ndoubles and shift n to flip the normals\r\nStep 07: Extra Touches\r\n9:51\r\nso let's preview the model I'm gonna\r\n9:53\r\napply shade smooth and you can already\r\n9:56\r\nsee it looks in my opinion perfect right\r\n9:58\r\nwe have those edges here but we will\r\n10:01\r\nremove them by adding The Edge Loops\r\n10:03\r\nsliding them to the Limit and offsetting\r\n10:07\r\nso those squares are more or less the\r\n10:08\r\nsame size as those here in the corner\r\n10:11\r\ngonna repeat it everywhere and this\r\n10:14\r\nalready is a usable model in my opinion\r\n10:17\r\nbecause we can apply subdivision surface\r\n10:19\r\nmodifier and you can see here we have\r\n10:22\r\nabsolutely no shading errors which I\r\n10:25\r\ndon't honestly get how it works\r\n10:27\r\nespecially because the mesh looks like\r\n10:29\r\nthis what if I want to add sharpness to\r\n10:32\r\nthose Corners actually with this method\r\n10:34\r\nit's not that much of a problem so let's\r\n10:36\r\nadd extra Edge Loops in all those areas\r\n10:40\r\nand when we rotate back here you can see\r\n10:43\r\nof course we have those extra edges they\r\n10:46\r\ndon't even yeah destroy the shading that\r\n10:48\r\nmuch but I would normally move\r\n10:50\r\neverything a little bit again extremely\r\n10:53\r\nprimitive but it works I select all\r\n10:55\r\nthose edges GG slide them hide them then\r\n10:59\r\nselect these edges GG and I move them\r\n11:02\r\nkind of to this vertex unhide everything\r\n11:07\r\nrepeat everywhere else\r\n11:13\r\nand there you have it I don't know how\r\n11:15\r\nit works I don't know why it works but\r\n11:17\r\nit looks beautiful and if you want to\r\n11:19\r\nlearn how to optimize this hellish 3D\r\n11:22\r\nmodel check out the video on the screen\r\n11:23\r\nand if you want to download the models\r\n11:25\r\ncreated in this

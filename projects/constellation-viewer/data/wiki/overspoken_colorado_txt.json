Though, I have lots to draw on from them. The ones of the mountains are just nice, I read a sign in front of the building in that second pic that suggested it was a public house; liked the upper balcony. The wind turbines from that third photos are apparently long idle. I liked the boxed balconies of the building in the fourth photo; dubbed roof turrets according to my father, who has prior experience in architecture. A photo of a boarded, wood walkway. Then a Wide protected Colorado mountain range and valleys. A suncast view, an old, sprawling tree.

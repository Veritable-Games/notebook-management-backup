But I have said\na great deal more about wording sentences and other matters. The plan of the book is\nto move from the larger problems facing the student writer down to smaller, subtler problems.\nThe first chapter deals with the nature of the rhetorical system. It tries to suggest\nthe decisions involved and the resources available when a writer faces a writing situation.\nThe next three chapters each deal with one of the elements in the rhetorical situation\nhas outlined by Aristotle. Content, audience and persona. My strategy in putting these\nchapters first is to encourage students to see that they have been communicating all their\nlives, have been communicating all their lives, and that the processes are not mysterious.\nThey should, meanwhile, be learning that writing is merely an extension, albeit more conscious.\nThe previous experience is in communicating the middle chapters of the book deal with\ntwo of the major departments of classical rhetoric, discovery, invention and organization.\nA discovery, he puts in parentheses, invention and organization. He puts parentheses, arrangement.\nThe chapter on invention does not treat the classical topics as rigidly as invention,\nas richly as, and as meticulously as some textbooks have. Indeed, it suggests some of the\nmajor strategies for discovering what to say. It also suggests some of the possible steps\nin the pre-writing stage of composition. The chapter on organization does deal with\nthe pattern of classical rhetoric. The chapter on organization.\nSeveral, two, come on, faster.\n\nChapter 1. Yeh-heh-heh.\nThe process of rhetoric. A human problem.\nYour congressman is a public servant whose job it is to represent you in Washington.\nAt least that's your what your seventh graded civic teacher, Ms. Frini, told you.\nWell, now it's time to exercise your rights and privileges as a voter and citizen.\nNow you will sit down and write a letter to the Honorable Wilbur D. Fairweather,\ncongressman from the Third Congressional District.\nYou'll tell him how you feel about a bill that will be coming up for a vote soon.\nThe Honey Import Act. Okay, he says. The Honey Import Act.\nThis bill will abolish all import quotas and import all import quotas and import duties on honey to a kid.\nAfter heading down the date and other niceties of the business letter that you learned in 10th grade,\nEnglish classes, you get down to a serious task of telling your congressman what you think.\nOh, no. Dear congressman, fairweather.\nA vote against the Honey Import Act.\nSincerely. Oh, John G. Andrews.\nIs that what they did?\nOkay. There's a lot of hearing on the front.\nExamine interest. Purpose in mind.\nPerspectives. Framework thought, examining, developing, overviews, thought.\nStyles, communication, work, and leisure.\nExamines to the process that leads to conceptual level.\nOrganization.\nYeah.\nOritization. That's really clever. Have we did that?\nThat is really clever. Patterns, expressions.\nLearning.\nGrowth. Oh, my goodness.\nYou have to search for the text in this.\nArtistic expression is.\nAnd it works almost in like a pattern.\nI'm sure you've seen this pattern work out.\nHe's had it stylized.\nHe has a finger pointing and like a dragon flying.\nAnd I set a mouth.\nWhat kind of tree is that?\nThe fish are really cool.\nIn influencing others, a dynamic, engaging, style and power.\nWriting style issues. Readability.\nInteresting.\nIs that friendship?\nExamine interest. Purpose in the mind.\nBack to the beginning. That's the whole text.\nHow communication, major discussion theory. Integrating.\nOkay. That's all of it.\nThat's really cool.\nSomehow that letter seems too short to abrupt.\nMaybe you should try a gentler approach.\nMaybe you should say, maybe you should say, please vote against.\nBut that's not right either.\nAnd you need to be forceful and say, you'd better vote against.\nThere. That's telling him.\nBut if he doesn't vote against the bill,\nor suppose he gets a letter saying, you'd better vote for the Honey Import Act.\nOh boy. Oh boy.\nAlthough the Honey Import Act is a minor bill that probably doesn't affect or interest most of you,\nit does illustrate the basic problem of rhetoric.\nHow can you get another person, in this case, the congressman, to do what you want him to do?\nOr in a more general sense, how can a speaker or the writer get his audience,\nthe person to whom he is speaking or writing, to react as a speaker wants him to?\nWell, one solution to the problem.\nOne way to answer this, to be a good teacher, is to do this.\nTo give the best rhetoric.\nOne solution to the problem.\nOne way to answer this question is to turn the problem around and look at it\nfrom the point of view of the audience.\nWhat should the audience choose to do?\nWhy should the audience choose to do one thing rather than another?\nWhy should the audience choose to do one thing rather than another?\nLet's consider the possibilities of congressman fair weather's position.\nFirst of all, fair weather may be so strongly in favor of the bill\nthat nothing could dissuade him from voting for it.\nThis way, him voting for it.\nHe might, for instance, be an advocate of free trade, a dogmatist,\na dogmatist who believes that all imported quotas and tariffs are wrong.\nOK, dogmatized policy.\nIf that's the case, he probably can't be persuaded to vote against the bill.\nOn the other hand, fair weather may be unalterably opposed to the bill.\nHe may believe that American producers should be protected and supported with protective tariffs.\nOr he may believe that B's performer valuable service to farmers by pollinating.\nOr he may believe that B's performer valuable service to farmers by pollinating crops as they gather honey.\nA service that needs to be encouraged with economic incentives such as higher prices for honey.\nIf that's the case, nothing that you can say is likely to change his opinion.\nOr fair weather may be completely undecided.\nPerhaps he knows nothing about honey and its importance as a farm product.\nIn that, in that, in this case, the congressman might be open to almost any suggestion from the people he represents.\nFinally, a boy, in this case, a boy, perhaps he knows nothing about honey.\nAnd it's importance as a farm product.\nIn this case, the congressman might be open to almost any suggestion from the people he represents.\nFinally, and most likely, fair weather's position may be somewhere in the middle.\nHe is slightly in favor of or opposed to the bill.\nBut he would change his stand if public opinion were strong against him.\nWe can represent fair weather's possible opinions as a continuum from strong opposition.\nMinus five, two strong support, plus five, as the figure below indicates.\nOkay, he's saying a range of indifference.\nMinus five is strong opposition, plus five is strong support.\nAs a retort, that's interesting.\nI might leave it on that.\nThat's a good note.\nI'll take picture of it too.\nFor game dev.\nGame dev.\nBecause that's really important to see where one would be indifferent and then step away for something.\nWhereas this thing of systems of beneficience, as I'm trying to describe, is really difficult.\nBut in difference, strong support and strong opposition, range of influence, he says to fair ones occurrence on behalf of a congressional vote to pass one way or the other to say no or yes on the register.\nOh boy, hang on.\n\nAs rhetoricians, yes, as rhetoricians, we will assume that if fair-weathers are in range\nfrom minus 3 to plus 3, he can be influenced by what we have to say.\nFor example, if you want the congressman to vote against the bill, and if his position\nis one of my own opposition, say minus 2 on the scale, your letter may encourage him\nto stand firmly in this opposition.\nIf however, he considers, if however, he slightly favors the bill, your letter could influence\nhim to reconsider his position, especially if quite a few other people write him letters\nopposing the bill.\nThese are the possibilities, unless, of course, you have more exact information about your\ncongressional, your congressman's position on the issue.\nLet's assume that you don't know your congressman's position on the Honey Import Act, and that\nyou want to send him a letter stating your position.\nHow will you go about influencing him to vote your way?\nOne possible approach.\nInstead of answering this question directly, we would again turn things around and look\nat them from congressman fair-weathers' perspective.\nLet's look at some of the letters he might receive from his constituents.\nFirst there are those letters that can depend primarily on who the letter is.\nHere is one of the congressmen.\nHere is one of the congressmen that might receive.\nDear Wilbur, I think you should vote against the Honey Import Act.\nBy the way, be sure to wear a hat and galoshes in this weather.\nLove, Mom.\nHere is a more realistic approach.\nDear Wilbur, since we've known each other since we were kids, I'll get right to the\npoint.\nI'd sure appreciate it if you'd vote against the Honey Import Act.\nOh my, he's suggesting you, that's, wow, that's interesting, but in extreme case.\nDear Wilbur, since we've known each other since we've known each other since we were\nkids, I'll get right to the point.\nI'd sure appreciate it if you'd vote against the Honey Import Act.\nAfter all, what are friends for if they can't help each other out a bit?\nIf they can't help each other out a bit.\nBy the way, send my best to Alfie, Effie, and the kids.\nYour friend Ed Brown, politician and best friend.\nOh my god, that's crazy, dude, how do you do that?\nIt's not threatening, but it's like, dear, could you please vote against the Honey Import\nAct?\nThanks, man, you're the best.\nBoth of these letters ask the congressman to vote against the bill solely on the basis\nof the writer's acquaintance with the congressman.\nNeither writer offers any inherent reasons why the congressman should vote against the bill.\nOh, now let's look at another letter that uses the same approach.\nDear congressman Fairweather, as president of Thomas Valley Beekeepers Association, and\non behalf of, oh boy, dear congressman Fairweather, as president of Thomas Valley Beekeepers Association,\nand on behalf of beekeepers throughout the state, I urge you to vote no to the Honey Import\nAct.\nWe are counting on your vote.\nSincerely, every in J.O. Conner, president of TVBA, or let's, okay, yeah, the honey, Thomas\nValley Beekeepers Association, okay, yeah, yeah, I get you, yeah, or let's look at another\nletter.\nDear congressman Fairweather, as a longtime supporter of yours, and as a precinct captain\nin East Side Grove Town, I know that you'll do the right thing here.\nYou'd do the right thing when the Honey Import Act comes up for a vote.\nI look forward to seeing your name and those of your colleagues from the rest of the state\nin overwhelming support of the Honey Import Act.\nBe sure to vote A. Sincerely, LC May Piffier, put yourself in the place of Wilbur D. Fairweather.\nCongressman, what effect are these letters likely to have on you?\nWhat effect are these letters likely to have on you?\nIs there any reason why you should pay much more attention to any one of these letters\nor to similar letters?\nWhat are the consequences of your vote?\nAs an experienced politician, Congressman Fairweather knows that his mom will still\nlove him no matter which way he votes.\nHe also knows that Ed Brown is an opportunist who likes to flaunt his friendship with the\ncongressman, but that his support may not be worth much, thus Fairweather probably won't\nbe swayed by either letter.\nHe can safely ignore both.\nWhen the chips are down, he assures himself, mom will vote for me.\nSo he's taken to his ideals that if Congressman Fairweather is a good man, he sees the ideals\nas not an opposition to the ones he would represent.\nI get you.\nOkay.\nPlay yourself in the place of Wilbur D. Fairweather.\nCongressman, what effect are these letters likely to have on you?\nIs there any reason why you should pay much attention to the OK, but I said already.\nHowever, Irvin, Jay O'Connor and LC may be a fear.\nOur different matters.\nJay O'Connor, though only one person, is writing as president of a large organization.\nHe cannot be considered just one man, but he must be reckoned with as a political force\nwho may be able to encourage substantial numbers to vote either for or against Congressman\nFairweather.\nHis plea will have to receive special attention.\nMiss P.F.\nYear 2 is not merely one voter with one vote.\nShe is a campaign worker who raises political funds, organizes political rallies, and gets\nO.\nAnd gets the pathetic voters out for the polls on election day.\nMoreover, as Fairweather realizes, he owes LC a favor after all the work that she has\ndone for him.\nThus, she decides, just thus, she deserves, thus the letters, the D.B.'s letters.\nI mean, these are social expectations.\nThese are built into us.\nSo thus, she deserves special treatment, too.\nExercises.\nConsider the different ways in which you would use your own character in qualities, character\nin qualities in presenting yourself to Congressman Fairweather.\nWhat specific roles would you choose?\nRead a paragraph to Congressman Fairweather.\nWhat role would you choose?\nWell, citizen, citizen, to give you best reflection on the thing you're talking about, the thing\nyou're trying to pass vote on, or not, right?\nYou would talk to ones that are against, yeah, you would talk to ones that are against,\nto bring them to recognition of the thing that you are.\nThe recognition you would see, you would see the votes vote for.\nOkay, so take the role, take the role of the citizen, okay, write a brief paragraph to\nCongressman Fairweather on the Honey Import Act.\nPresent yourself as one of the following, an angry consumer, an angry beekeeper, a young\nbeekeeper who raises bees as a hobby, or a devotee of natural foods, who lives primarily\non honey and wheat germ, or a devotee of natural foods, who lives primarily on honey and wheat\ngerm, okay, he's saying a hippie, or something like that, it's funny, okay, yeah, just\nI think you'd probably listen to probably the angry beekeeper and the beekeeper who raises\nbees as a hobby, maybe, no, probably not the hobby, the hobby is not interesting, the\nhobby is not an angry consumer, no, not even that, I would pass those ones that are well\nrethoracized consumers in the act of being angry, but another approach, there are other\nletters that depend primarily on the information they convey to persuade Congressman Fairweather\non how he should vote on the Honey Import Act.\nSuch letters are often filled with statistics, facts and writing, the letter, but on, oh boy,\nfacts and assertions about reality, these letters focus not on who is writing the letter,\nbut on what they have to say about reality, the writers are concerned with concern, the\nwriters are concerned with concern with concern with content, in this case, the effect\nthat the Honey Import Act will have on the world, the effect that, oh boy, in this case,\nthe effect that the Honey Import Act will have on the world, or their little pollution of\nit, or their little, or their little, or their little pollution of it, here is a sample\nof that approach, I mean, that's at the best, then you could vote for, like, honey is,\nthat's a good example, dude, honey, dear Congressman Fairweather, the consumers of this country\nhave been paying artificially high prices for honey, for far too long, by abolishing\nrestrictions on the importation of honey, you will be putting honey within the budget\nof most families, oh, by abolishing restrictions on the importation of honey, you will be putting\nhoney within the budget of most families, as it is now, honey is too expensive for most\nfamilies to use regularly, if you allow imports, the price will probably decline a good\ndeal, at least that's what economists at the university have said, I urge you to vote\nfor the Honey Import Act, sincerely, James and Nebens, or the letter, my look, or the\nletter, okay, continue, or the letter, or the letter might look like this, dear Congressman\nFairweather, according to government statistics, wholesale prices have increased by about 12%\nin the last few years, also, the price of gasoline has increased by about 20 cents a gallon,\nand the minimum wage has jumped almost $1 an hour, and yet the minimum wage has jumped\nalmost $1 an hour, but it has not moved, what was this book written? 1981, I can't, under\nthese conditions, a lot of farmers in this district will go broke if the honey import\nact passes, most of the farmers in this district had net incomes last year of only a few thousand\ndollars, many stay in business because of their added income from keeping bees, but if the\nprice of honey, but if the price of honey goes any lower, a lot of us farmers won't be able\nto make a living, I ask you to support, I ask you to support a decent standard of living\nfor farmers, for farmers, by voting against the Honey Import Act, truly yours, James K. Mullin,\nokay, so to boost both, oh yeah, alright, anyway, I was processing that, ah, let's do\nthat, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay\n\nwhich letter or letters would be most convincing to you?\nWhich rhetorical method was most effective?\nThat based on the identity of the writer,\nthat based on appeals to the evidence in the case,\nor that based on your emotional response to the situation.\nThere is, of course, no right answer.\nSome of you will respond one way, some another,\nand others still a third way.\nAny one of these approaches can be effective.\nA truth that was recognized by the Greek philosopher,\nAristotle, about 25 centuries ago.\nAristotle analyzed, Aristotle analyzed,\nthe rhetorical situation,\nany situation in which one person communicates with another,\nas having three components.\nA speaker, or writer,\ntwo, one, a speaker, or writer,\ntwo, an audience, or reader,\nand three, a message, or content.\nAristotle classified rhetorical means,\naccording to which element in the rhetorical situation\nwas most prominent.\nThus, if a speaker or writer emphasized his own character,\neach of those, Aristotle called this appeal the ethical appeal.\nIf the speaker emphasized the emotions of the audience,\nif, oh, this is the best text, hang on.\nAh, no, it's not enough.\nI don't think it's that old.\n\nSo these three things are important.\nThe three appeals.\nSo one, in writing, in rhetoric, in the thing of giving oration.\nOne, a speaker or writer, or in writing too.\nA speaker or writer.\nThree appeals.\nThe appeal to a speaker or writer.\nTwo, the appeal to an audience or reader.\nAnd three, an appeal to a message.\nA context to the message or content.\nSo Aristotle classified rhetorical means,\naccording to which element in the rhetorical situation was most prominent.\nThus, if a speaker or writer emphasized his own character, ethos,\nAristotle called this appeal the ethical appeal.\nIf the speaker emphasized the emotions of the audience,\nhe called this the emotional appeal.\nIf the speaker emphasized the content, the actual truth about the subject,\nhe called this the rational appeal.\nWhich is really the best to use.\nInterestingly enough, Aristotle said that the rational approach was the ideal method for rhetoric.\nThe rational approach just, oh my god, you just say exactly as you feel on the thing.\nHe called this the say with the actual truth, but the actual truth is your own.\nSo say as best you know, give retort as best you know.\nSay on best you know, hear on, listen.\nBut hear on, hear on best you know.\nGive, give, listen and give response as best you would.\nThe emotional appeal, the ethical appeal,\nand then your ethos as expression in the thing of rhetoric,\nin the thing of, well, the thing of the rational appeal in way of soliloquy as I'm doing it.\nBecause I have no one to speak to.\nI'm recording this though, so that's not technically incorrect.\nI feel that I'm speaking to somebody.\n\nOkay, if the speaker emphasized the content, the actual truth about the subject, he called\nthis the rational appeal, the rational appeal, which is really best, which of those three\nis really best to use. Okay, okay, one more time though. Aristotle called these Aristotle\nAristotle, called this appeal, the ethical appeal. Oh boy, hang on, one more time, hold on\nit. Aristotle, Aristotle classified rhetorical\nmeans according to which element in the cl- in the rhetorical situation was most prominent.\nThus, if a speaker or writer emphasized his own character, ethos, Aristotle called this\nappeal, the ethical appeal. If the speaker emphasized the emotions of the audience, he\ncalled this the emotional appeal. If the speaker emphasized the content, the actual truth\nabout the subject, he called this the rational approach, or the rational appeal, which of\nthese three is really best to use. Interestingly enough, Aristotle, Aristotle said that the rational\napproach was the ideal method for rhetoric, but he said that the ethical or personal appeal\nwas the most effective. However, he spent much more effort on analyzing emotional appeals\nthan he did on analyzing the other two appeals. So Aristotle couldn't seem to actually decide\non an answer any more than we can. An objection and a response. Hang on.\n\nThe standards of rhetorical effectiveness.\nThe explanation in the preceding paragraph seems clear enough, but it also seems pretty\nvague.\nHow can we tell anyone who will respond to any appeals in any situation?\nAny situation.\nIsn't that just a hit or miss procedure in which we're more likely to miss than to hit?\nOr to put the question more generally and abstractly, can there be any system to rhetoric\nwhere rhetoric deals with the whims of human personality?\nTo answer that question, let's consider what may be a familiar situation for you and\nmany other college students.\nSuppose you need $50 for a weekend skiing or surfing or just having a blast.\nWhen you have a strategy for asking your parents for some money, perhaps you write to your\nfather at his office, or you may telephone your mother, or you may telephone your mother.\nAnd when do you know your father won't be home?\nOr perhaps you write to tell how hard you've been studying.\nOr perhaps you write to tell how hard you've been studying, something that's shown by\nthe A's on your last three exams and explain how you really need some relaxation.\nIn other words, you do have a rhetorical strategy, a plan for presenting your rhetorical\nstrategy, a plan for presenting your character, and your case in the best possible light for\nyour audience.\nNow this example of asking a parent for money is a good rhetorical model.\nIn the sense that effectiveness of the rhetoric is a good rhetorical model.\nNow this example of asking a parent for money is a good rhetorical model in the sense that\neffectiveness of the rhetoric is pretty easy to judge.\nIf you get the money, your rhetoric has been effective.\nIf you don't get the money, your rhetoric has been ineffective.\nThat's a pretty easy situation to evaluate.\nHowever, it is not always so easy to judge the effectiveness of our rhetoric because\nour rhetorical goal is not always an action or an objective result.\nOften our goal in writing is not to get somebody to do something, not to get somebody to do\nsomething.\nWe may want merely to explain something to someone, or we may want someone to sympathize\nwith us, or we may want our audience to think more carefully about our subject, or you\nmay just be meandering to say on something, you didn't mean to say on.\nA work of rhetoric must be judged in relation to its purpose.\nThank you.\n\nBecause you've been practicing, oh man, because you've been practicing rhetoric all your life, the formal study of rhetoric won't be too difficult for you.\nBecause you've been practicing rhetoric all your life, the formal study of rhetoric, the formal study of...\nBecause you've been practicing rhetoric, oh man, because you've been practicing rhetoric all your life, the formal study of rhetoric won't be too difficult for you.\nThe chief difference, the chief difference, the chief difference will be that your study of rhetoric will now be more systematic and rigid.\nYou will be asked to think more carefully and edit and edit Buffaba. You will be asked to think more carefully and analytically about your rhetorical decisions.\nThese few examples have probably been enough to show that there is the total message, that there is a message rhetoric. Most of the message books will be about how to question the fight that you're writing.\nHowever, before doing anything else, let's get back to our original problem.\nSo, in writing a letter to a congressman, so to demonstrate, you're wanting of them to decide on an issue.\nSo, this person's name is...\nHe's been arguing for a bit, but this person is Wilbur D. Fairweather.\nSo, deciding an issue, how will congressmen Wilbur D. Fairweather vote on their legislation?\nThis legislation, the Honey Import Act.\nHow should he vote? What appeals will persuade him?\nOn most political issues, we hope that right...\nOh, come on. You need to vote context.\nThat's too far. I don't read it again.\nOkay, let's try this one.\n\nThe thing is to try. Write a letter to your congressman or senator on an issue you feel\nstrong about. When you receive his reply to your letter, analyze the appeals that he\nuses in his letter. Look at some ads on television, horror magazines, and newspapers, and analyze\nwhich appeals they emphasize. Read the letters to the read, the letters to the editor, column\nin a newspaper or magazine, using her own intuitive responses as guides, as guides.\nEvaluate the letter by putting them in numeric order with one for the best, two for the second\nbest, and so forth. Then try to analyze the letter to see if you can discover the reasons\nfor your responses. Writing assignments. In doing any writing assignments, it must be a useful\nrhetorical exercise to list the following information at the beginning of your paper. Subject\nand one is subject to his audience. Characteristics. Three is speaker description. Four is rhetorical\ngoal. Four is rhetorical goal. Five is rhetorical strategy. Here, for instance, is a simple plan\nfor the first assignment below. Subject. Increase in, okay, let's say a subject. Increase\nin state income tax. Two is audience. State Senator Jones. A conservative. Three is speaker.\nA mildly angry. A mildly angry. But still reasonable citizen. Four is rhetorical goal. To\nget Senator Jones to vote against the bill. Five is rhetorical strategy. To show that\nbudget cuts could be made to avoid this increased tax. One. Write a substantial letter on\nthe controversial issue as though you were going to send it to a public official, a newspaper\nor a magazine. Write a letter to your teacher for sweating him that you shouldn't have to\ndo. Two do one of these writing, writing assignments. Okay.\n\n(skipped REC070)\n\nWhether subjects deal with the present are a whole new class of subjects for rhetoric or\nwhether they are merely forms of deliberative and judicial rhetoric is perhaps unclear.\nNevertheless, we do argue at such issues as whether the incumbent president is an effective\nleader whether the whether whether whether that's a good example whether whether\nwhether mentor a mental mental telepathy is a reality whether life exists elsewhere\non a universe okay that that one is discernible though you could you could you could\ndo mathematics for that the other one is a fiction and whether our national defense is sufficiently\nstrong okay I see the judgment about about the president in our first example can only be\nmade based on the based on the past so it might be considered judicial judicial rhetoric the\njudgment about the national defense probably the judgment about the national defense probably\nprobably points to policy decisions so it might be considered deliberative deliberative\ndeliberative but questions about mental telepathy often or life elsewhere in the universe are clearly\nabout the the present state of things and do not immediately and do not immediately imply\nany action okay the the pink your corn in my attic is named Steve you could not say he does not\nexist he is he is my best friend this person Steve this this this pink your her name Steve\nand in the text so the the fiction is the fiction being disposed is not of consequence but if\nit's a fiction that is common then it is of consequence in the in the in the secular nature\nof our of our legislative body to keep keep the pink your corn name Steve out of politics\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/Rec_34_~_77.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, character-design, quest\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.069Z",

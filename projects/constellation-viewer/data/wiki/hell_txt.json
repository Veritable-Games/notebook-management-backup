british industrial conglomerate \r\n a form of asbestos once used to make kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than N years ago researchers reported \r\n the asbestos fiber <unk> is unusually <unk> once it enters the <unk> with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later researchers said \r\n <unk> inc. the unit of new york-based <unk> corp. that makes kent cigarettes stopped using <unk> in its <unk> cigarette filters in N \r\n although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago the latest results appear in today 's new england journal of medicine a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem \r\n a <unk> <unk> said this is an old story \r\n we 're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties \r\n there is no asbestos in our products now \r\n neither <unk> nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the kent cigarettes \r\n we have no useful information on whether users are at risk said james a. <unk> of boston 's <unk> cancer institute \r\n dr. <unk> led a team of researchers from the national cancer institute and the medical schools of harvard university and boston university \r\n the <unk> spokeswoman said asbestos was used in very modest amounts in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of <unk> in N \r\n from N to N N billion kent cigarettes with the filters were sold the company said \r\n among N men who worked closely with the substance N have died more than three times the expected number \r\n four of the five surviving workers have <unk> diseases including three with recently <unk> cancer \r\n the total of N deaths from malignant <unk> lung cancer and <unk> was far higher than expected the researchers said \r\n the <unk> rate is a striking finding among those of us who study <unk> diseases said dr. <unk> \r\n the percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the west <unk> mass. paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in western industrialized countries he said \r\n the plant which is owned by <unk> & <unk> co. was under contract with <unk> to make the cigarette filters \r\n the finding probably will support those who argue that the u.s. should regulate the class of asbestos including <unk> more <unk> than the common kind of asbestos <unk> found in most schools and other buildings dr. <unk> said \r\n the u.s. is one of the few industrialized nations that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth <unk> fibers such as <unk> that are classified as <unk> according to <unk> t. <unk> a professor of <unk> at the university of vermont college of medicine \r\n more common <unk> fibers are <unk> and are more easily rejected by the body dr. <unk> explained \r\n in july the environmental protection agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos \r\n by N almost all remaining uses of <unk> asbestos will be outlawed \r\n about N workers at a factory that made paper for the kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s \r\n areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the <unk> was used \r\n workers dumped large <unk> <unk> of the imported material into a huge <unk> poured in cotton and <unk> fibers and <unk> mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters \r\n workers described clouds of blue dust that hung over parts of the factory even though <unk> fans <unk> the area \r\n there 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted <unk> diseases said <unk> phillips vice president of human resources for <unk> & <unk> \r\n but you have to recognize

declines in interest rates \r\n the average seven-day compound yield of the N taxable funds tracked by <unk> 's money fund report eased a fraction of a percentage point to N N from N N for the week ended tuesday \r\n compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year \r\n average maturity of the funds ' investments <unk> by a day to N days the longest since early august according to donoghue 's \r\n longer maturities are thought to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period \r\n shorter maturities are considered a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner \r\n the average maturity for funds open only to institutions considered by some to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely reached a high point for the year N days \r\n nevertheless said <unk> <unk> <unk> editor of money fund report yields may <unk> up again before they <unk> down because of recent rises in short-term interest rates \r\n the yield on six-month treasury bills sold at monday 's auction for example rose to N N from N N \r\n despite recent declines in yields investors continue to pour cash into money funds \r\n assets of the N taxable funds grew by $ N billion during the latest week to $ N billion \r\n typically money-fund yields beat comparable short-term investments because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates \r\n the top money funds are currently yielding well over N N \r\n dreyfus world-wide dollar the <unk> fund had a seven-day compound yield of N N during the latest week down from N N a week earlier \r\n it invests heavily in dollar-denominated

N and said that he would n't <unk> any appeals or other attempts to block his order by commonwealth edison \r\n the refund pool may not be held <unk> through another round of appeals judge curry said \r\n commonwealth edison said it is already appealing the underlying commission order and is considering appealing judge curry 's order \r\n the exact amount of the refund will be determined next year based on actual <unk> made until dec. N of this year \r\n commonwealth edison said the ruling could force it to slash its N earnings by $ N a share \r\n for N commonwealth edison reported earnings of $ N million or $ N a share \r\n a commonwealth edison spokesman said that tracking down the two million customers whose addresses have changed during the past N N years would be an administrative nightmare \r\n in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday commonwealth edison closed at $ N down N cents \r\n the $ N billion <unk> N plant near <unk> ill. was completed in N \r\n in a disputed N ruling the commerce commission said commonwealth edison could raise its electricity rates by $ N million to pay for the plant \r\n but state courts upheld a challenge by consumer groups to the commission 's rate increase and found the rates illegal \r\n the illinois supreme court ordered the commission to audit commonwealth edison 's construction expenses and refund any <unk> expenses \r\n the utility has been collecting for the plant 's construction cost from its N million customers subject to a refund since N \r\n in august the commission ruled that between $ N million and $ N million of the plant 's construction cost was <unk> and should be <unk> plus interest \r\n in his ruling judge curry added an additional $ N million to the commission 's calculations \r\n last month judge curry set the

manufacture control devices \r\n the new plant located in <unk> about N miles from seoul will help meet increasing and diversifying demand for control products in south korea the company said \r\n the plant will produce control devices used in motor vehicles and household appliances \r\n the survival of spinoff cray computer corp. as a fledgling in the supercomputer business appears to depend heavily on the creativity and <unk> of its chairman and chief designer seymour cray \r\n not only is development of the new company 's initial machine tied directly to mr. cray so is its balance sheet \r\n documents filed with the securities and exchange commission on the pending spinoff disclosed that cray research inc. will withdraw the almost $ N million in financing it is providing the new firm if mr. cray leaves or if the <unk> project he heads is scrapped \r\n the documents also said that although the <unk> mr. cray has been working on the project for more than six years the cray-3 machine is at least another year away from a fully operational prototype \r\n moreover there have been no orders for the cray-3 so far though the company says it is talking with several prospects \r\n while many of the risks were anticipated when <unk> cray research first announced the spinoff in may the <unk> it attached to the financing had n't been made public until yesterday \r\n we did n't have much of a choice cray computer 's chief financial officer gregory <unk> said in an interview \r\n the theory is that seymour is the chief designer of the cray-3 and without him it could not be completed \r\n cray research did not want to fund a project that did not include seymour \r\n the documents also said that cray computer anticipates <unk> perhaps another $ N million in financing beginning next september \r\n but mr. <unk> called that a <unk> scenario \r\n the filing on the details of the spinoff caused cray research stock to jump $ N yesterday to close at $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading \r\n analysts noted yesterday that cray research 's decision to link its $ N million <unk> note to mr. cray 's presence will complicate a valuation of the new company \r\n it has to be considered as an additional risk for the investor said gary p. <unk> of <unk> group inc. minneapolis \r\n cray computer will be a concept stock he said \r\n you either believe seymour can do it again or you do n't \r\n besides the designer 's age other risk factors for mr. cray 's new company include the cray-3 's tricky <unk> chip technology \r\n the sec documents describe those chips which are made of <unk> <unk> as being so fragile and minute they will require special <unk> handling equipment \r\n in addition the cray-3 will contain N processors twice as many as the largest current supercomputer \r\n cray computer also will face intense competition not only from cray research which has about N N of the world-wide supercomputer market and which is expected to roll out the <unk> machine a direct competitor with the cray-3 in N \r\n the spinoff also will compete with international business machines corp. and japan 's big three hitachi ltd. nec corp. and fujitsu ltd \r\n the new company said it believes there are fewer than N potential customers for <unk> priced between $ N million and $ N million presumably the cray-3 price range \r\n under terms of the spinoff cray research stockholders are to receive one cray computer share for every two cray research shares they own in a distribution expected to occur in about two weeks \r\n no price for the new shares has been set \r\n instead the companies will leave it up to the marketplace to decide \r\n cray computer has applied to trade on nasdaq \r\n analysts calculate cray computer 's initial book value at about $ N a share \r\n along with the note cray research is <unk> about $ N million in assets primarily those related to the cray-3 development which has been a drain on cray research 's earnings \r\n <unk> balance sheets clearly show why cray research favored the spinoff \r\n without the cray-3 research and development expenses the company would have been able to report a profit of $ N million for the first half of N rather than the $ N million it posted \r\n on the other hand had it existed then cray computer would have incurred a $ N million loss \r\n mr. cray who could n't be reached for comment will work for the new colorado springs colo. company as an independent contractor the arrangement he had with cray research \r\n regarded as the father of the supercomputer mr. cray was paid $ N at

however five other countries china thailand india brazil and mexico will remain on that so-called priority watch list as a result of an interim review u.s. trade representative carla hills announced \r\n under the new u.s. trade law those countries could face accelerated <unk> investigations and stiff trade sanctions if they do n't improve their protection of intellectual property by next spring \r\n mrs. hills said many of the N countries that she placed under <unk> degrees of scrutiny have made genuine progress on this touchy issue \r\n she said there is growing <unk> around the world that

countries are n't completely off the hook though \r\n they will remain on a <unk> list that includes N other countries \r\n those countries including japan italy canada greece and spain are still of some concern to the u.s. but are deemed to pose <unk> problems for american patent and copyright owners than those on the priority list \r\n gary hoffman a washington lawyer specializing in <unk> cases said the threat of u.s. <unk> combined with a growing recognition that protecting intellectual property is in a country 's own interest prompted the improvements made by south korea taiwan and saudi arabia \r\n what this tells us is that u.s. trade law is working he said \r\n he said mexico could be one of the next countries to be removed from the priority list because of its efforts to craft a new patent law \r\n mrs. hills said that the u.s. is still concerned about disturbing developments in turkey and continuing slow progress in malaysia \r\n she did n't elaborate although earlier u.s. trade reports have complained of videocassette <unk> in malaysia and <unk> for u.s. pharmaceutical patents in turkey \r\n the N trade act requires mrs. hills to issue another review of the performance of these countries by april N \r\n so far mrs. hills has n't deemed any cases bad enough to merit an accelerated investigation under the so-called special N provision of the act \r\n argentina said it will ask creditor banks to <unk> its foreign debt of $ N billion the <unk> in the developing world \r\n the declaration by economy minister <unk> <unk> is believed to be the first

that year the apple ii commodore pet and tandy <unk> came to market \r\n the computers were crude by today 's standards \r\n apple ii owners for example had to use their television sets as screens and

requested duty-free treatment for many types of watches covered by N different u.s. tariff <unk> \r\n the white house said mr. bush decided to grant duty-free status for N categories but turned down such treatment for other types of watches because of the potential for material injury to watch producers located in the u.s. and the virgin islands \r\n <unk> is a major u.s. producer and seller of

show the strong interest of japanese investors in u.s. <unk> instruments fannie mae 's chairman david o. maxwell said at a news conference \r\n he said more than N N of the funds were placed with japanese institutional investors \r\n the rest went to investors from france and hong kong \r\n earlier this year japanese investors snapped up a similar $ N million mortgage-backed securities mutual fund \r\n that fund was put together by blackstone group a new york investment bank \r\n the latest two funds were assembled jointly by goldman sachs & co. of the u.s. and japan 's daiwa securities co \r\n the new seven-year funds one offering a fixed-rate return and the other with a floating-rate return linked to the london interbank offered rate offer two key advantages to japanese investors \r\n first they are designed to eliminate the risk of prepayment mortgage-backed securities can be retired early if interest rates decline and such prepayment forces investors to <unk> their money at lower rates \r\n second they channel monthly mortgage payments into semiannual payments reducing the administrative burden on investors \r\n by addressing those problems mr. maxwell said the new funds have become extremely attractive to japanese and other investors outside the u.s. \r\n such devices have boosted japanese investment in mortgage-backed securities to more than N N of the $ N billion in such instruments outstanding and their purchases are growing at a rapid rate \r\n they also have become large purchasers of fannie mae 's corporate debt buying $ N billion in fannie mae bonds during the first nine months of the year or almost a <unk> of the total amount issued \r\n james l. <unk> <unk> executive vice president was named a director of this oil concern expanding the board to N

foreign currencies and special drawing rights fell by a hefty $ N billion in october to $ N billion the finance ministry said \r\n the total marks the sixth consecutive monthly decline \r\n the <unk> downturn reflects the intensity of bank of japan <unk> intervention since june when the u.s. currency temporarily surged above the N yen level \r\n the announcement follows a sharper $ N billion decline in the country 's foreign reserves in september to $ N billion \r\n pick a country any country \r\n it 's the latest investment craze sweeping wall street a rash of new closed-end country funds those publicly traded portfolios that invest in stocks of a single foreign country \r\n no fewer than N country funds have been launched or registered with regulators this year triple the level of all of N according to charles e. simon & co. a washington-based research firm \r\n the turf recently has ranged from chile to <unk> to portugal \r\n next week the philippine fund 's launch will be

guinea fund <unk> george foot a managing partner at <unk> management associates of <unk> mass \r\n the recent explosion of country funds <unk> the closed-end fund mania of the 1920s mr. foot says when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular \r\n they fell into <unk> after the N crash \r\n unlike traditional <unk> mutual funds most of these <unk> portfolios are the closed-end type issuing a fixed number of shares that trade publicly \r\n the surge brings to nearly N the number of country funds that are or soon will be listed in new york or london \r\n these funds now account for several billions of dollars in assets \r\n people are looking to stake their claims now before the number of available nations runs out says michael porter an analyst at smith barney harris upham & co. new york \r\n behind all the <unk> is some <unk> competition \r\n as individual investors have turned away from the stock market over the years securities firms have scrambled to find new products that brokers find easy to sell \r\n and the firms are stretching their <unk> far and wide to do it \r\n financial planners often urge investors to diversify and to hold a <unk> of international securities \r\n and many emerging markets have <unk> more mature markets such as the u.s. and japan \r\n country funds offer an easy way to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of seeking out individual companies \r\n but it does n't take much to get burned \r\n political and currency gyrations can <unk> the funds \r\n another concern the funds ' share prices tend to swing more than the broader market \r\n when the stock market dropped nearly N N oct. N for instance the mexico fund plunged about N N and the spain fund fell N N \r\n and most country funds were clobbered more than most stocks after the N crash \r\n what 's so wild about the funds ' frenzy right now is that many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value of their underlying portfolios \r\n after trading at an average discount of more than N N in late N and part of last year country funds currently trade at an average premium of N N \r\n the reason share prices of many of these funds this year have climbed much more sharply than the foreign stocks they hold \r\n it 's probably worth paying a premium for funds that invest in markets that are partially closed to foreign investors such as south korea some specialists say \r\n but some european funds recently have skyrocketed spain fund has surged to a startling N N premium \r\n it has been targeted by japanese investors as a good long-term play tied to N 's european economic integration \r\n and several new funds that are n't even fully invested yet have jumped to trade at big premiums \r\n i 'm very alarmed to see these rich <unk> says smith barney 's mr. porter \r\n the newly <unk> premiums reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds mr. porter suggests \r\n unlike many u.s. investors those in asia or europe seeking <unk> exposure may be less <unk> to paying higher prices for country funds \r\n there may be an international viewpoint cast on the funds listed here mr. porter says \r\n nonetheless plenty of u.s. analysts and money managers are <unk> at the <unk> trading levels of some country funds \r\n they argue that u.s. investors often can buy american depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds these so-called adrs represent shares of foreign companies traded in the u.s. \r\n that way investors can essentially buy the funds without paying the premium \r\n for people who insist on jumping in now to buy the funds <unk> 's mr. foot says the only advice i have for these folks is that those who come to the party late had better be ready to leave quickly \r\n the u.s. and soviet union are holding technical talks about possible repayment by moscow of $ N million in <unk> russian debts owed to the u.s. government the state department said \r\n if the debts are repaid it could clear the way for soviet bonds to be sold in the u.s. \r\n however after two meetings with the soviets a state department spokesman said that it 's too early to say whether that will happen \r\n <unk> with the talks the state department said it has permitted a soviet bank to open a new york branch \r\n the branch of the bank for foreign economic affairs was approved last spring and opened in july \r\n but a soviet bank here would be <unk> unless moscow found a way to settle the $ N million debt which was lent to the country 's short-lived democratic <unk> government before the communists seized power in N \r\n under a N law the johnson debt default act as amended it 's illegal for americans to extend credit to countries in default to the u.s. government unless they are members of the world bank and international monetary fund \r\n the u.s.s.r. belongs to neither organization \r\n moscow has settled <unk> debts with other countries in recent years at less than face value \r\n the state department stressed the <unk> debts as the key to satisfying the johnson act \r\n but the soviets might still face legal obstacles to raising money in the u.s. until they settle hundreds of millions of dollars in additional debt still outstanding from the world war ii <unk> program \r\n in another reflection that the growth of the economy is <unk> off the government said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed to rise in september \r\n meanwhile the national association of purchasing management said its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in october for the sixth consecutive month \r\n its index inched up to N N in october from N N in september \r\n any reading below N N suggests the manufacturing sector is generally declining \r\n the purchasing managers however also said that orders turned up in october after four months of decline \r\n factories booked $ N billion in orders in september nearly the same as the $ N billion in august the commerce department said \r\n if not for a N N surge in orders for capital goods by defense contractors factory orders would have fallen N N \r\n in a separate report the department said construction spending ran at an annual rate of $ N billion not significantly different from the $ N billion reported for august \r\n private construction spending was down but government building activity was up \r\n the figures in both reports were adjusted to remove the effects of usual seasonal patterns but were n't adjusted for inflation \r\n kenneth <unk> economist for society corp. a cleveland bank said demand for exports of factory goods is beginning to <unk> off \r\n at the same time the drop in interest rates since the spring has failed to revive the residential construction industry \r\n what sector is stepping forward to pick up the slack he asked \r\n i draw a blank \r\n by most measures the nation 's industrial sector is now growing very slowly if at all \r\n factory <unk> fell in september \r\n so did the federal reserve board 's <unk> index \r\n yet many economists are n't predicting that the economy is about to slip into recession \r\n they cite a lack of imbalances that provide early warning signals of a downturn \r\n inventories are closely watched for such clues for instance \r\n economists say a buildup in inventories can <unk> cutbacks in production that can lead to a recession \r\n but yesterday 's factory orders report had good news on that front it said factory inventories fell N N in september the first decline since february N \r\n this <unk> to the soft landing scenario said elliott <unk> an economist at donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities corp \r\n i do n't see any signs that inventories are excessive \r\n a soft landing is an economic slowdown that <unk> inflation without leading to a recession \r\n the department said orders for <unk> goods those intended to last fewer than three years fell N N in september to $ N billion after climbing N N the month before \r\n orders for durable goods were up N N to $ N billion after rising N N the month before \r\n the department previously estimated that <unk> orders fell N N in september \r\n factory shipments fell N N to $ N billion after rising N N in august \r\n shipments have been relatively level since january the commerce department noted \r\n manufacturers ' backlogs of unfilled orders rose N N in september to $ N billion helped by strength in the defense capital goods sector \r\n excluding these orders backlogs declined N N \r\n in its construction spending report the commerce department said residential construction which accounts for nearly half of all construction spending was off N N in september to an annual rate of $ N billion \r\n david <unk> economist for the mortgage bankers association predicted the drop in interest rates eventually will boost spending on single-family homes but probably not until early next year \r\n spending on private <unk> construction was off N N to an annual rate of $ N billion with no sector showing strength \r\n government construction spending rose N N to $ N billion \r\n after adjusting for inflation the commerce department said construction spending did n't change in september \r\n for the first nine months of the year total construction spending ran about N N above last year 's level \r\n the government 's construction spending figures contrast with a report issued earlier in the week by mcgraw-hill inc. 's <unk> dodge group \r\n dodge reported an N N increase in construction contracts awarded in september \r\n the <unk> counts money as it is spent dodge counts contracts when they are awarded \r\n the government includes money spent on residential <unk> dodge does n't \r\n although the purchasing managers ' index continues to indicate a slowing economy it is n't <unk> an imminent recession said robert <unk> chairman of the association 's survey committee and director of materials management at pitney bowes inc. stamford conn \r\n he said the index would have to be in the low N N range for several months to be considered a forecast of recession \r\n the report offered new evidence that the nation 's export growth though still continuing may be slowing \r\n only N N of the purchasing managers reported better export orders in october down from N N in september \r\n and N N said export orders were down last month compared with N N the month before \r\n the <unk> managers ' report also added evidence that inflation is under control \r\n for the fifth consecutive month purchasing managers said prices for the goods they purchased fell \r\n the decline was even <unk> than in september \r\n they also said that vendors were delivering goods more quickly in october than they had for each of the five previous months \r\n economists consider that a sign that <unk> pressures are <unk> \r\n when demand is stronger than suppliers can handle and delivery times <unk> prices tend to rise \r\n the purchasing managers ' report is based on data provided by more than N purchasing executives \r\n each of the survey 's indicators <unk> the difference between the number of purchasers reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening \r\n for the first time the october survey polled members on imports \r\n it found that of the N N who import N N said they imported more in october and N N said they imported less than the previous month \r\n while acknowledging one month 's figures do n't prove a trend mr. <unk> said it does lead you to suspect imports are going down or at least not increasing that much \r\n items listed as being in short supply numbered only about a dozen but they included one <unk> milk and milk <unk> \r\n it 's an odd thing to put on the list mr. <unk> noted \r\n he said that for the second month in a row food processors reported a shortage of <unk> dry milk \r\n they blamed increased demand for dairy products at a time of exceptionally high u.s. exports of dry milk coupled with very low import quotas \r\n

japanese author who clearly does n't belong to the <unk> <unk> school of writers who <unk> the notion of the unique japanese <unk> by outsiders \r\n if a wild sheep chase carries an implicit message

aerospace company and <unk> heavy industries ltd. mitsubishi heavy industries ltd. and fuji heavy industries ltd \r\n the three japanese companies build the body sections of the N accounting for a combined N N of the aircraft \r\n japanese press reports have speculated that the japanese contribution could rise to between N N and N N under the new program \r\n if boeing goes ahead with the larger N the plane could hit the market in the mid-1990s \r\n this is the year the negative ad for years a secondary presence in most political campaigns became the main event \r\n the irony is that the attack commercial after getting a boost in last year 's presidential campaign has come of age in an <unk> election year with only a few <unk> scattered across the country \r\n but in the three leading political <unk> of N the negative ads have reached new levels of <unk> raising fears that this kind of <unk> empty of significant issues is <unk> in a new era of campaigns without content \r\n now says joseph <unk> a pioneer in political television the idea is to attack first last and always \r\n a trend that started with the first <unk> of politics accelerated with the <unk> of the television age and became a <unk> art form in N has reached an entirely new stage \r\n to get people 's attention these days says douglas <unk> a political consultant your tv ad needs to be bold and entertaining and more often than not that means <unk> \r\n and unlike a few years ago you do n't even have to worry whether the ad is <unk> \r\n in N as often as not the principal fights in the major campaigns are prompted by the ads themselves \r\n take a look then at the main attack commercials that set the tone for tuesday 's elections in new york city new jersey and virginia \r\n new york city \r\n the screen <unk> with a small tight <unk> shot of david dinkins democratic candidate for mayor of new york city \r\n david dinkins failed to file his income taxes for four straight years says a <unk> male voice \r\n and then this television commercial paid for by republican rudolph giuliani 's campaign and produced by roger <unk> the master of negative tv ads really gets down to business \r\n mr. dinkins the ad charges also failed to report his campaign contributions accurately <unk> his links to a failing insurance company and paid a convicted <unk> through a phony organization with no members no receipts and no office \r\n david dinkins says the <unk> why does he always wait until he 's caught \r\n nasty <unk> says john <unk> mr. dinkins 's issues director designed to <unk> a case of political corruption that simply does n't exist \r\n <unk> by the giuliani ads mr. dinkins 's tv consultants robert <unk> and david <unk> finally <unk> a negative ad of their own \r\n the screen shows two distorted <unk> photos presumably of two politicians \r\n compare two candidates for mayor says the announcer \r\n one says he 's for banning <unk> bullets \r\n the other has opposed a ban on <unk> bullets \r\n one claims he 's pro-choice \r\n the other has opposed a woman 's right to choose \r\n funny thing says the <unk> both these candidates are named rudolph giuliani \r\n who 's telling the truth \r\n everybody and nobody \r\n it 's a classic situation of ads that are true but not always fully accurate \r\n mr. dinkins did fail to file his income taxes for four years but he insists he voluntarily admitted the oversight when he was being considered for a city job \r\n he was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems but he insists he made no secret of it \r\n the city 's campaign finance board has refused to pay mr. dinkins $ N in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete \r\n the campaign has blamed these reporting problems on computer errors \r\n and says mr. dinkins he did n't know the man his campaign paid for a <unk> effort had been convicted of <unk> \r\n but say mr. dinkins 's managers he did have an office and his organization did have members \r\n mr. giuliani 's campaign chairman peter powers says the dinkins ad is deceptive \r\n the other side he argues knows giuliani has always been pro-choice even though he has personal reservations \r\n they know he is generally opposed to <unk> bullets but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation \r\n virginia \r\n democratic <unk> gov. douglas wilder opened his gubernatorial battle with republican marshall coleman with an abortion commercial produced by frank <unk> that analysts of every political <unk> agree was a tour de force \r\n against a shot of <unk> <unk> on an american flag an announcer talks about the strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty that <unk> have <unk> for generations \r\n then just as an image of the <unk> of thomas jefferson <unk> from the screen the announcer continues on the issue of abortion marshall coleman wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians \r\n that commercial which said mr. coleman wanted to take away the right of abortion even in cases of rape and incest a charge mr. coleman denies changed the dynamics of the campaign <unk> it at least in part into a <unk> on abortion \r\n the ad prompted mr. coleman the former virginia attorney general to launch a series of advertisements created by bob goodman and designed to shake mr. wilder 's support among the very women who were attracted by the abortion ad \r\n the coleman <unk> featured a <unk> of a young woman in <unk> and the ad suggested that she was <unk> an <unk> courtroom <unk> \r\n a voice says <unk> now do n't you have <unk> \r\n then an announcer <unk> it was douglas wilder who introduced a bill to force rape victims age N and younger to be <unk> about their private lives by lawyers for accused <unk> \r\n so the next time mr. wilder talks about the rights of women ask him about this law he tried to pass \r\n mr. wilder did introduce such legislation N years ago but he did so at the request of a <unk> a common legislative technique used by lawmakers \r\n the legislation itself noted that it was introduced by request and in N mr. wilder introduced a bill to protect rape victims from <unk> <unk> \r\n people have grown tired of these ads and coleman has gotten the <unk> of being a negative <unk> says mark <unk> a political scientist at mary washington college \r\n wilder has managed to get across the idea that coleman will say anything to get elected governor and more important has been able to put the <unk> for all the negative <unk> on coleman \r\n mr. coleman said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive <unk> but the truce lasted only hours \r\n by tuesday night television stations were carrying new ads featuring mr. coleman himself raising questions about mr. wilder 's <unk> to rape victims \r\n new jersey \r\n the attacks began when democratic rep. james florio aired an ad featuring a drawing of <unk> and a photograph of mr. florio 's rival republican rep. jim courter \r\n remember <unk> says a female voice \r\n consider jim courter \r\n and then this commercial produced by bob <unk> gets down to its own mean and <unk> business \r\n pictures of <unk> oil <unk> <unk> into focus and the female voice <unk> that hazardous waste on his mr. courter 's property the neighbors are suing for consumer fraud \r\n and the nose on mr. courter 's face grows \r\n the only fraud involved cry mr. courter 's <unk> is the florio commercial itself and so the courter campaign has responded with its own <unk> commercial produced by mr. <unk> \r\n in this one the screen <unk> with photographs of both candidates \r\n who 's really lying asks a female voice \r\n florio 's lying the voice goes on because the barrel on courter 's land contained heating oil was <unk> up and caused no pollution \r\n mr. courter 's long nose <unk> while mr. florio 's grows \r\n who 's telling the truth \r\n stephen <unk> a political scientist at new jersey 's <unk> institute says it 's another example of an ad that 's true but not fully accurate \r\n barrels were dumped on the courter property a complaint was made but there is no evidence the barrels were a serious threat to the environment \r\n even so according to mr. <unk> the ad was devastating because it raised questions about mr. courter 's credibility \r\n but it 's building on a long tradition \r\n in N on route to a re-election rout of democrat frank <unk> gop gov. nelson rockefeller of new york appeared in person saying if you want to keep the crime rates high <unk> is your man \r\n a seat on the chicago board of trade was sold for $ N down $ N from the previous sale last friday \r\n seats currently are quoted at $ N

N N \r\n japanese investment in southeast asia is <unk> the region toward economic integration \r\n interviews with analysts and business people in the u.s. suggest that japanese capital may produce the economic cooperation that southeast asian politicians have pursued in fits and starts for decades \r\n but japan 's power in the region also is <unk> fears of domination and <unk> fresh policy questions \r\n the flow of japanese funds has set in motion a process <unk> these economies will be <unk> together by the great japanese investment machine says robert <unk> vice chairman of goldman sachs international corp \r\n in the past five years japanese companies have tripled their commitments in asia to $ N billion \r\n in thailand for example the government 's board of investment approved $ N million of japanese investment in N N times the u.s. investment figure for the year \r\n japan 's commitment in southeast asia also includes steep increases in foreign assistance and trade \r\n asia 's other <unk> countries are following japan 's lead and pumping capital into the region \r\n in taiwan and south korea rising wages are forcing manufacturers to seek other overseas sites for <unk> production \r\n these nations known as asia 's little <unk> also are contributing to southeast asia 's integration but their influence will remain subordinate to japan 's \r\n for <unk> countries such as thailand and malaysia the investment will provide needed jobs and spur growth \r\n but asian nations ' harsh memories of their military domination by japan in the early part of this century make them fearful of falling under japanese economic <unk> now \r\n because of budget constraints in washington the u.s. encourages japan to share economic burdens in the region \r\n but it <unk> yielding political ground \r\n in the coming decade analysts say <unk> relations will be tested as tokyo comes to terms with its new status as the region 's economic <unk> \r\n japan 's swelling investment in southeast asia is part of its economic evolution \r\n in the past decade japanese manufacturers concentrated on domestic production for export \r\n in the 1990s spurred by rising labor costs and the strong yen these companies will increasingly turn themselves into <unk> with plants around the world \r\n to capture the investment southeast asian nations will move to accommodate japanese business \r\n these nations ' internal decisions will be made in a way not to <unk> their largest aid <unk> largest private investor and largest lender says richard <unk> director of the international business and research program at the university of southern california 's graduate school of business \r\n japanese money will help turn southeast asia into a more <unk> economic region \r\n but analysts say asian cooperation is n't likely to parallel the european common market approach \r\n rather japanese investment will spur integration of certain sectors says kent <unk> a specialist in east asian economies at the <unk> wilson school for public and <unk> affairs at princeton university \r\n in electronics for example a japanese company might make television picture <unk> in japan <unk> the sets in malaysia and export them to indonesia \r\n the effect will be to pull asia together not as a common market but as an integrated production zone says goldman sachs 's mr. <unk> \r\n countries in the region also are beginning to consider a <unk> for closer economic and political ties \r\n the economic and foreign ministers of N asian and pacific nations will meet in australia next week to discuss global trade issues as well as regional matters such as transportation and telecommunications \r\n participants will include the u.s. australia canada japan south korea and new zealand as well as the six members of the association of southeast asian nations thailand malaysia singapore indonesia the philippines and <unk> \r\n in addition the u.s. this year offered its own plan for cooperation around the pacific <unk> in a major speech by secretary of state james baker following up a proposal made in january by australian prime minister bob <unk> \r\n the baker proposal <unk> washington 's intention to continue playing a leading political role in the region \r\n in asia as in europe a new order is taking shape mr. baker said \r\n the u.s. with its regional friends must play a crucial role in designing its architecture \r\n but maintaining u.s. influence will be difficult in the face of japanese dominance in the region \r\n japan not only <unk> the u.s. in investment flows but also <unk> it in trade with most southeast asian countries although the u.s. remains the leading trade partner for all of asia \r\n moreover the japanese government now the world 's largest aid <unk> is pumping far more assistance into the region than the u.s. is \r\n while u.s. officials voice optimism about japan 's <unk> role in asia they also convey an <unk> of caution \r\n there 's an understanding on the part of the u.s. that japan has to expand its functions in asia says j. michael <unk> undersecretary of commerce for trade \r\n if they approach it with a <unk> <unk> attitude there will be a net gain for everyone \r\n some asian nations are <unk> about washington 's demand that tokyo step up its military spending to ease the u.s. security burden in the region \r\n the issue is further complicated by uncertainty over the future of the u.s. 's leases on military bases in the philippines and by a possible u.s. troop reduction in south korea \r\n many <unk> regard a u.s. presence as a desirable <unk> to japanese influence \r\n no one wants the u.s. to pick up its <unk> and go home mr. <unk> says \r\n for their part taiwan and south korea are expected to step up their own investments in the next decade to try to slow the japanese <unk> \r\n they do n't want japan to <unk> the region and <unk> it up says <unk> lee professor of east asian politics at the university of pennsylvania \r\n <unk> rice could hardly believe her eyes \r\n while giving the comprehensive test of basic skills to ninth <unk> at greenville high school last march N she spotted a student looking at <unk> sheets \r\n she had seen cheating before but these notes were <unk> \r\n a <unk> is an example of a profession in trade and finance \r\n at the end of world war ii germany surrendered before japan \r\n the <unk> conference committee is used when a bill is passed by the house and senate in different forms \r\n virtually word for word the notes matched questions and answers on the <unk> section of the test the student was taking \r\n in fact the student had the answers to almost all of the N questions in that section \r\n the student surrendered the notes but not without a protest \r\n my teacher said it was ok for me to use the notes on the test he said \r\n the teacher in question was nancy yeargin considered by many students and parents to be one of the best at the school \r\n confronted mrs. yeargin admitted she had given the questions and answers two days before the examination to two <unk> geography classes \r\n she had gone so far as to display the questions on an overhead <unk> and <unk> the answers \r\n mrs. yeargin was fired and prosecuted under an unusual south carolina law that makes it a crime to breach test security \r\n in september she pleaded guilty and paid a $ N fine \r\n her alternative was N days in jail \r\n her story is partly one of personal <unk> \r\n she was an <unk> teacher who won <unk> and inspired students but she will probably never teach again \r\n in her wake she left the <unk> and anger of a principal who was her friend and now calls her a <unk> of colleagues who say she brought them shame of students and parents who defended her and insist she was treated <unk> and of <unk> officials stunned that despite the <unk> nature of her actions she became something of a local <unk> \r\n mrs. yeargin 's case also <unk> some light on the dark side of school reform where pressures on teachers are growing and where <unk> testing has enhanced the temptation to <unk> \r\n the N statute mrs. yeargin violated was designed to enforce provisions of south carolina 's <unk> laws \r\n prosecutors alleged that she was trying to bolster students ' scores to win a bonus under the state 's N education improvement act \r\n the bonus depended on her ability to produce higher <unk> scores \r\n there is incredible pressure on school systems and teachers to raise test scores says walt <unk> an education professor and testing specialist at boston college \r\n so efforts to beat the tests are also on the rise \r\n and most disturbing it is educators not students who are blamed for much of the wrongdoing \r\n a <unk> study released in september by friends for education an <unk> n.m. <unk> group concluded that outright cheating by american educators is common \r\n the group says standardized achievement test scores are greatly inflated because teachers often teach the test as mrs. yeargin did although most are never caught \r\n evidence of widespread cheating has surfaced in several states in the last year or so \r\n california 's education department suspects adult responsibility for <unk> at N schools that changed wrong answers to right ones on a statewide test \r\n after numerous <unk> of questionable teacher help to students texas is <unk> its security practices \r\n and sales of <unk> booklets for classroom instruction are booming \r\n these materials including <unk> school publishing co. 's scoring high and learning materials are nothing short of sophisticated <unk> sheets according to some recent academic research \r\n by using them teachers with administrative blessing telegraph to students <unk> the precise areas on which a test will concentrate and sometimes give away a few exact questions and answers \r\n use of scoring high is widespread in south carolina and common in greenville county mrs. yeargin 's school district \r\n experts say there is n't another state in the country where tests mean as much as they do in south carolina \r\n under the state 's education improvement act low test scores can block students ' promotions or force entire districts into <unk> <unk> <unk> that can mean <unk> \r\n high test scores on the other hand bring recognition and extra money a new computer lab for a school grants for special projects a bonus for the <unk> \r\n and south carolina says it is getting results \r\n since the reforms went in place for example no state has posted a higher rate of improvement on the <unk> <unk> test than south carolina although the state still posts the lowest average score of the about N states who use the sat as the primary college <unk> examination \r\n critics say south carolina is paying a price by stressing improved test scores so much \r\n friends of education rates south carolina one of the worst seven states in its study on academic cheating \r\n says the organization 's founder john <unk> <unk> mrs. yeargin is a way for administrators to protect themselves and look like they take cheating seriously when in fact they do n't take it seriously at all \r\n paul <unk> director of testing for the south carolina department of education says mr. <unk> 's allegations of cheating are <unk> without foundation and based on unfair <unk> \r\n partly because of worries about potential abuse however he says the state will begin keeping closer track of <unk> preparation booklets next spring \r\n south carolina 's reforms were designed for schools like greenville high school \r\n standing on a <unk> hill in a <unk> area of this old textile city the school has educated many of south carolina 's best and <unk> including the state 's last two governors nobel prize winning <unk> charles <unk> and actress <unk> <unk> \r\n but by the early 1980s its glory had faded like the yellow bricks of its broad <unk> \r\n it was full of violence and gangs and kids cutting class says linda ward the school 's principal \r\n crime was awful test scores were low and there was no <unk> in <unk> programs \r\n mrs. ward took over in N becoming the school 's seventh principal in N years \r\n her immediate predecessor suffered a nervous breakdown \r\n prior to his term a teacher <unk> to death in the halls <unk> by a student \r\n <unk> mrs. ward says the school was having trouble serving in harmony its two <unk> and evenly split student groups a <unk> white elite from old <unk> neighborhoods and blacks many of them poor from <unk> inner city neighborhoods \r\n mrs. ward resolved to clean out <unk> in the school 's faculty and restore safety and she also had some new factors working in her behalf \r\n one was statewide school reform which raised overall educational funding and <unk> in a new public spirit for school <unk> \r\n another was nancy yeargin who came to greenville in N full of the energy and ambitions that reformers wanted to reward \r\n being a teacher just became my life says the <unk> mrs. yeargin a teacher for N years before her dismissal \r\n i loved the school its history \r\n i even <unk> about school and new things to do with my students \r\n while mrs. ward fired and restructured staff and struggled to improve <unk> mrs. yeargin worked <unk> days and fast became a student favorite \r\n in N and N she applied for and won bonus pay under the reform law \r\n encouraged by mrs. ward mrs. yeargin taught honor students in the state teacher <unk> program a reform creation designed to encourage good students to consider teaching as a career \r\n she won grant money for the school advised <unk> ran the <unk> club proposed and taught a new cultural <unk> class in western <unk> and was chosen by the school <unk> as teacher of the year \r\n she was an <unk> lady she had it all together says <unk> <unk> a freshman at the university of south carolina who had mrs. yeargin in the <unk> class last year \r\n she says that because of mrs. yeargin she gave up ambitions in architecture and is studying to become a teacher \r\n mary beth <unk> a greenville <unk> <unk> also says mrs. yeargin inspired her to go into education \r\n she taught us more in western <unk> than i 've ever learned in other classes says <unk> green a greenville senior \r\n in the classroom students say mrs. yeargin distinguished herself by <unk> teaching approaches forcing kids to pair up to complete classroom work or using <unk> type <unk> \r\n on <unk> she came to work to prepare study plans or sometimes even to polish the furniture in her classroom \r\n she just never gave it up says mary <unk> mary beth 's mother \r\n you 'd see her <unk> <unk> in the stands at a football game \r\n some fellow teachers however viewed mrs. yeargin as <unk> and too yielding to students \r\n mrs. ward says she often defended her to colleagues who called her a <unk> \r\n pressures began to build \r\n friends told her she was pushing too hard \r\n because of deteriorating hearing she told colleagues she feared she might not be able to teach much longer \r\n mrs. yeargin 's extra work was also helping her earn points in the state 's <unk> program \r\n but the most important source of points was student improvement on tests \r\n huge gains by her students in N and N meant a total of $ N in bonuses over two years a meaningful addition to her annual salary of $ N \r\n winning a bonus for a third year was n't that important to her mrs. yeargin insists \r\n but others at greenville high say she was eager to win if not for money then for pride and recognition \r\n mary elizabeth <unk> another <unk> teacher says she believed mrs. yeargin wanted to keep her standing high so she could get a new job that would n't demand good hearing \r\n indeed mrs. yeargin was interested in a possible job with the state teacher <unk> program \r\n last march after attending a teaching <unk> in washington mrs. yeargin says she returned to greenville two days before annual testing feeling that she had n't prepared her <unk> geography students adequately \r\n when test booklets were passed out N hours ahead of time she says she <unk> questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to students \r\n mrs. yeargin admits she made a big mistake but insists her <unk> were correct \r\n i was trying to help kids in an unfair testing situation she says \r\n only five of the N questions were geography questions \r\n the rest were history <unk> finance subjects they never had \r\n mrs. yeargin says that she also wanted to help lift greenville high school 's overall test scores usually near the bottom of N district high schools in <unk> carried annually by local newspapers \r\n mostly she says she wanted to prevent the damage to <unk> that her <unk> students would suffer from doing badly on the test \r\n these kids broke my heart she says \r\n a whole day goes by and no one even knows they 're alive \r\n they desperately needed somebody who showed they <unk> for them who loved them \r\n the last thing they needed was another <unk> blow \r\n school officials and prosecutors say mrs. yeargin is lying \r\n they found students in an advanced class a year earlier who said she gave them similar help although because the case was n't tried in court this evidence was never presented publicly \r\n that pretty much <unk> any <unk> that she was out to help the poor <unk> child says joe watson the prosecutor in the case who is also president of greenville high school 's <unk> association \r\n mrs. yeargin concedes that she went over the questions in the earlier class adding i wanted to help all students \r\n mr. watson says mrs. yeargin never complained to school officials that the standardized test was unfair \r\n do i have much <unk> for her mr. watson asks \r\n not really \r\n i believe in the system \r\n i believe you have to use the system to change it \r\n what she did was like taking the law into your own hands \r\n mrs. ward says that when the cheating was discovered she wanted to avoid the <unk> public disclosure that a trial would bring \r\n she says she offered mrs. yeargin a quiet resignation and thought she could help save her teaching certificate \r\n mrs. yeargin declined \r\n she said something like you just want to make it easy for the school \r\n i was <unk> mrs. ward recalls \r\n it was like someone had turned a <unk> in me \r\n to the <unk> and <unk> of her <unk> and legal authorities and perhaps as a measure of the <unk> of standardized tests <unk> yeargin won widespread local support \r\n the <unk> hearing at which she was dismissed was crowded with students teachers and parents who came to testify on her behalf \r\n supportive callers <unk> unfair testing not mrs. yeargin on a local radio talk show on which she appeared \r\n the show did n't give the <unk> of mrs. yeargin 's <unk> saying only that she helped students do better on the test \r\n the message to the board of education out of all this is we 've got to take a serious look at how we 're doing our <unk> and our testing policies in this state said the <unk> host \r\n <unk> in the greenville newspaper allowed that mrs. yeargin was wrong but also said the case showed how testing was being <unk> \r\n the radio show <unk> us says mrs. ward \r\n partly because of the show mr. watson says the district decided not to recommend mrs. yeargin for a first-time offenders program that could have <unk> the charges and the conviction from her record \r\n and legal authorities <unk> up an investigation worthy of a murder case \r\n over N witnesses mostly students were interviewed \r\n at greenville high school meanwhile some students especially on the <unk> <unk> were crushed \r\n it 's hard to explain to a <unk> why someone they like had to go says mrs. ward \r\n soon <unk> appeared in the <unk> that carried the school 's familiar <unk> <unk> <unk> on the front \r\n on the back the shirts read we have all the answers \r\n many colleagues are angry at mrs. yeargin \r\n she did a lot of harm says <unk> rice who had discovered the <unk> notes \r\n we work damn hard at what we do for damn little pay and what she did cast unfair <unk> on all of us \r\n but several teachers also say the incident <unk> doubt on the wisdom of evaluating teachers or schools by using standardized test scores \r\n says <unk> key a <unk> teacher the incentive pay thing has opened up a can of <unk> \r\n there may be others doing what she did \r\n mrs. yeargin says she pleaded guilty because she realized it would no longer be possible to win <unk> and because she was afraid of further charges \r\n mrs. ward for one was relieved \r\n despite the strong evidence against mrs. yeargin popular sentiment was so strong in her favor mrs. ward says that i 'm afraid a jury would n't have convicted her \r\n since <unk> first touched slate <unk> have wanted to know what 's on the test \r\n these days students can often find the answer in <unk> <unk> and <unk> their teachers give them in the weeks prior to taking standardized achievement tests \r\n the <unk> section of the widely used california achievement test asks fifth <unk> what is another name for the roman <unk> <unk> \r\n it also asks them to add <unk> and <unk> \r\n <unk> in a <unk> <unk> called learning materials sold to schools across the country by <unk> school publishing co. contain the same questions \r\n in many other <unk> there is almost no difference between the real test and learning materials \r\n what 's more the test and learning materials are both produced by the same company <unk> a joint venture of mcgraw-hill inc. and macmillan 's parent britain 's maxwell communication corp \r\n close parallels between tests and practice tests are common some educators and researchers say \r\n <unk> booklets software and <unk> are a booming publishing <unk> \r\n but some practice products are so similar to the tests themselves that critics say they represent a form of <unk> cheating \r\n if i took these preparation booklets into my classroom i 'd have a hard time <unk> to my students and parents that it was n't cheating says john <unk> a <unk> city mich. teacher who has studied test <unk> \r\n he and other critics say such <unk> aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests which is to gauge learning progress \r\n it 's as if france decided to give only french history questions to students in a european history class and when everybody <unk> the test they say their kids are good in european history says john <unk> an <unk> n.m. <unk> and founder of an educational research organization friends for education which has studied standardized testing \r\n standardized achievement tests are given about N million times a year across the country to students generally from <unk> through eighth grade \r\n the most widely used of these tests are <unk> 's cat and comprehensive test of basic skills the iowa test of basic skills by <unk> <unk> co. and <unk> <unk> <unk> inc. 's metropolitan achievement test and stanford achievement test \r\n sales figures of the <unk> materials are n't known but their reach into schools is significant \r\n in arizona california florida louisiana maryland new jersey south carolina and texas educators say they are common classroom tools \r\n <unk> says well over N million of its scoring high <unk> books have been sold since their introduction N years ago with most sales in the last five years \r\n about N sets of learning materials teachers ' <unk> have also been sold in the past four years \r\n the materials in each set reach about N students \r\n scoring high and learning materials are the <unk> preparation tests \r\n michael kean director of marketing for <unk> <unk> the <unk> division that publishes learning materials says it is n't aimed at improving test scores \r\n he also asserted that exact questions were n't <unk> \r\n when referred to the questions that matched he said it was <unk> \r\n mr. <unk> the <unk> and william <unk> a michigan state university education professor concluded in a study last june that cat test versions of scoring high and learning materials should n't be used in the classroom because of their similarity to the actual test \r\n they devised a <unk> scale <unk> one point for each <unk> measured on the cat test to rate the <unk> of test <unk> to the <unk> cat \r\n because many of these <unk> the <unk> of <unk> figures metric measurement of volume or pie and bar <unk> for example are only a small part of the total <unk> <unk> mr. <unk> says the preparation <unk> would n't <unk> too many if their real intent was general instruction or even general <unk> with test procedures \r\n but learning materials matched on N of N <unk> \r\n scoring high matched on N \r\n in cat sections where students ' knowledge of <unk> <unk> sounds is tested the authors noted that scoring high concentrated on the same sounds that the test does to the exclusion of other sounds that fifth <unk> should know \r\n learning materials for the <unk> contains at least a dozen examples of exact matches or close parallels to test items \r\n rick <unk> senior editor of scoring high says that messrs. <unk> and <unk> are ignoring the need students have for becoming familiar with tests and testing format \r\n he said authors of scoring high <unk> avoid <unk> exact questions but he does

one of the few medical institutions conducting privately funded research on fetal-tissue transplants \r\n but dr. <unk> warns that dr. mason 's ruling may discourage private funding \r\n the <unk> of federal funds and the climate in which the decision was made certainly do n't provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support he said \r\n despite the <unk> over transplants federal funding of research involving <unk> <unk> will continue on a number of fronts \r\n such research may ultimately result in the ability to <unk> damaged <unk> or to turn off genes

one of the largest wine shops in dallas \r\n what 's different is that it is happening with young wines just coming out \r\n we 're seeing it partly because older <unk> are growing more scarce \r\n wine auctions have almost exhausted the limited supply of those wines mr. shapiro continued we 've seen a dramatic decrease in demand for wines from the <unk> and <unk> which go for $ N to $ N a

because producers do n't like to see a hit wine dramatically increase in price later on \r\n even if there is consumer resistance at first a wine that wins high ratings from the critics will eventually move \r\n there may be <unk> reaction initially said mr. <unk> but as the wine is talked about and starts to sell they eventually get excited and decide it 's worth the <unk> price to add it to their collection \r\n it 's just sort of a <unk> thing with some people added larry shapiro \r\n they like to talk about having the new red rock <unk> one of diamond creek 's <unk> or the dunn N cabernet or the <unk> \r\n producers have seen this market opening up and they 're now creating wines that appeal to these people \r\n that explains why the number of these wines is expanding so rapidly \r\n but consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they were a few years ago \r\n they wo n't buy if the quality is not there said <unk> martin of martin wine <unk> in new orleans \r\n or if they feel the wine is <unk> and they can get something equally good for less \r\n mr. martin has increased prices on some wines like <unk> hills <unk> now $ N just to slow down movement but he is beginning to see some resistance to high-priced red <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in the $ N to $ N range \r\n image has of course a great deal to do with what sells and what does n't and it ca n't be forced \r\n wine merchants ca n't keep <unk> <unk> in stock but they have to push salon <unk> <unk> even lowering the price from $ N to $ N \r\n it 's hardly a question of quality the N salon is a beautiful wine but as mr. <unk> noted people have their own ideas about value \r\n it 's interesting to find that a lot of the expensive wines are n't always walking out the door \r\n in

transactions mr. simmons has followed friendly offers with a hostile tender offer \r\n although georgia gulf has n't been eager to negotiate with mr. simmons and nl a specialty chemicals concern the group apparently believes the company 's management is interested in some kind of transaction \r\n the management group owns about N N of the stock most purchased at nominal prices and would stand to gain millions of dollars if the company were sold \r\n in the third quarter georgia gulf earned $ N million or $ N a share down from $ N million or $ N a share on fewer shares outstanding \r\n sales

officials from both nations say the u.s. public 's <unk> about japanese investment could color a second round of <unk> economic talks scheduled for next week in washington \r\n not that washington and tokyo disagree on the japanese acquisitions indeed each has come out in favor of <unk> investment in the u.s. \r\n where they disagree is on the subject of u.s. direct investment in japan \r\n the u.s. wants the removal of what it <unk> as barriers to investment japan denies there are real barriers \r\n the <unk> talk <unk> up by recent japanese investments in the u.s. is focusing attention on the differences in investment climate even though it 's only one of many subjects to be covered in the <unk> talks known as the structural <unk> initiative \r\n the japanese should see this rhetoric as a signal of the need for a change in their own economy says charles <unk> u.s. assistant treasury secretary who has been in tokyo this week <unk> discussing the impending negotiations with government and business leaders \r\n we have a long history of maintaining an open <unk> policy mr. <unk> says \r\n u.s. investors should have a greater opportunity at direct investment in japan \r\n the japanese <unk> openly about the u.s. public 's <unk> \r\n one clear sign of japan 's nervousness came this week when a spokesman for japan 's foreign ministry devoted nearly all of a regular half-hour briefing for foreign journalists to the subject of recent japanese investments in the u.s. \r\n we believe that it is <unk> important for those japanese business interests in the u.s. to be more aware of the <unk> and concerns of the american people said the spokesman <unk> <unk> \r\n at the same time though he <unk> the media for paying such close attention to japanese investment when other foreign countries notably britain are acquiring more american assets \r\n fears that japanese investors are buying up america have <unk> sharply in the past several weeks with sony corp. 's purchase of columbia pictures entertainment inc. from coca-cola co. and mitsubishi estate co. 's acquisition of a N N holding in rockefeller group the owner of some of <unk> manhattan 's most exclusive real estate \r\n even before those moves added fuel the fires of <unk> had been well <unk> by the highly publicized experience in japan of one u.s. investor t. boone pickens jr \r\n the texas <unk> has acquired a N N stake valued at more than $ N billion in an <unk> company <unk> manufacturing co \r\n but he has failed to gain any influence at the company \r\n <unk> has refused to grant mr. pickens seats on its board <unk> he is a <unk> trying to pressure <unk> 's other shareholders into buying him out at a profit \r\n mr. pickens made considerable political <unk> with his troubles in japan \r\n the senate finance committee <unk> by a fellow <unk> democratic sen. lloyd <unk> last month urged u.s. trade representative carla hills to use mr. pickens 's experience in talks with tokyo to highlight this problem facing americans who seek access to the japanese capital markets \r\n while mr. <unk> and japanese officials say the question of investors ' access to the u.s. and japanese markets may get a disproportionate share of the public 's attention a number of other important economic issues will be on the table at next week 's talks \r\n among them are differences in savings and investment rates corporate structures and management and government spending \r\n each side has a <unk> of recommendations for the other \r\n the u.s. says it is anxious for results \r\n we feel very strongly that we really need action across the full range of issues we 've identified and we need it by next spring mr. <unk> says \r\n both sides have agreed that the talks will be most successful if negotiators start by focusing on the areas that can be most easily changed \r\n but they have n't <unk> what those might be \r\n after the first set of meetings two months ago some u.s. officials complained that japan had n't come up with specific changes it was prepared to make \r\n the japanese <unk> that the first round was too early to make concessions \r\n just to say the distribution system is wrong does n't mean anything says a ministry of international trade and industry official \r\n we need to clarify what exactly is wrong with it \r\n that process of <unk> out <unk> is likely to take time the japanese say no matter how badly the u.s. wants quick results \r\n for instance at the first meeting the two sides could n't even agree on basic data used in price discussions \r\n since then a team of about N <unk> and u.s. commerce department officials have crossed the globe <unk> consumer prices \r\n by monday they hope to have a <unk> of documents both sides can trust \r\n little by little there is progress says the <unk> official \r\n both sides are taking action \r\n <unk> <unk> contributed to this article \r\n while worry grows about big japanese investments in the u.s. japan 's big trading companies are rapidly increasing their stake in america 's smaller business \r\n for japan the controversial trend improves access to american markets and technology \r\n but for small american companies it also provides a growing source of capital and even marketing help \r\n take the deal with candela laser corp. a <unk> mass. manufacturer of high-tech medical devices which three years ago set its sights on japan as an export market \r\n partly to help clear the <unk> obstacles facing any overseas company trying to <unk> japan tiny candela turned to mitsui & co. one of japan 's largest trading companies for investment \r\n in a joint-venture deal mitsui <unk> candela through tokyo 's bureaucratic <unk> \r\n it eventually secured ministry of health import approval for two candela laser products one that breaks up kidney stones and another that <unk> skin <unk> \r\n at last count candela had sold $ N million of its medical devices in japan \r\n the deal also gave mitsui access to a high-tech medical product \r\n they view this as a growth area so they went about it with a <unk> approach says richard <unk> a candela vice president \r\n indeed for many japanese trading companies the favorite u.s. small business is one whose research and development can be <unk> for future japanese use \r\n the japanese companies <unk> many small u.s. companies with promising products or ideas frequently putting their money behind projects that commercial banks wo n't touch \r\n japanese companies have financed small and medium-sized u.s. firms for years but in recent months the pace has taken off \r\n in the first half of N alone japanese corporations invested $ N million in minority positions in u.s. companies a N N rise from the figure for all of N reports venture economics inc \r\n the needham mass. concern tracks investments in new businesses \r\n in addition of course some of the japanese investments involved outright purchase of small u.s. firms \r\n heightened japanese interest in american small business parallels an acceleration of investments giving japanese companies control of large highly visible u.s. corporations such as columbia pictures entertainment inc \r\n only this week it was announced that mitsubishi estate co. had acquired a N N stake in rockefeller group which owns new york 's prestigious rockefeller center \r\n while the small deals are far less <unk> they add to japanese <unk> of the u.s. market \r\n as the deals also improve japanese access to american technology and market knowledge they feed american <unk> in this area too \r\n even a <unk> product like plate glass can catch a trading company 's fancy if there 's a strategic fit \r\n free state glass industries of <unk> va. a small <unk> of architectural glass was <unk> under its original management \r\n last year mitsubishi international corp. the new york-based arm of mitsubishi corp. bought controlling interest in the glass company in a joint venture with ronald <unk> a glass industry executive and mitsubishi consultant \r\n the deal is <unk> designed to give mitsubishi a window on the u.s. glass industry says <unk> <unk> an executive in mitsubishi 's general merchandise department in new york \r\n it 's not just a simple investment in a small company mr. <unk> says \r\n we want to see the glass market from the inside not the outside \r\n mitsubishi 's investment in free state is very small less than $ N million mr. <unk> says \r\n mr. <unk> declines to comment on the arrangement \r\n trading companies such as mitsubishi mitsui c. <unk> & co. and <unk> corp. which make many of the japanese investments in small u.s. concerns have no u.s. counterpart \r\n these <unk> integrated combines some of which got their start in japan 's <unk> period deal <unk> in commodities construction and manufacturing \r\n they operate ships and banks \r\n all the <unk> are looking for new business says arthur <unk> adviser to the president of mitsui u.s.a. using the japanese term for the largest of the global trading houses \r\n adds <unk> <unk> senior vice president of c. <unk> america inc. we have a great interest in making investments particularly in new ventures \r\n a host of electronics firms in california 's silicon valley were financed with <unk> venture capital \r\n profit at least in the short term is usually a secondary goal \r\n strategic objectives not financial return drive many of the deals says a venture economics spokesman \r\n in investing on the basis of future transactions a role often performed by merchant banks trading companies can cut through the <unk> that <unk> owners often face with their local commercial banks \r\n it 's the classic problem of the small businessman says malcolm <unk> managing director of trading alliance corp. of new york \r\n people are <unk> at the door to take his product but he does n't have the working capital to make the thing and commercial banks are very <unk> \r\n they want assets they want a balance sheet which has no <unk> to the business a company can generate \r\n adds mitsui 's mr. <unk> unlike corporations in this country trading companies are n't so much interested in a high return on investment as they are on increasing trade flows \r\n to the extent they can do this they 're quite content to get a return on investment of N N to N N \r\n mr. <unk> says mitsui has N u.s. subsidiaries in which it holds N N interest or more and the trading company hopes to double the number of its u.s. affiliates in N \r\n sales by these subsidiaries in the fiscal year ending last march were more than $ N billion \r\n a N N to N N return on $ N billion ai n't <unk> mr. <unk> says \r\n hudson general corp. 's president and chief executive officer alan j. <unk> resigned \r\n mr. <unk> N years old could n't be reached for comment \r\n a company spokesman declined to elaborate on the departure \r\n hudson general which provides maintenance fueling and other services to airlines and airports reported a loss for its most recent fiscal year and last month omitted the semiannual dividend on its common shares \r\n mr. <unk> who had been with the company more than N years and had been president since N will act as a consultant to hudson general \r\n his duties as chief executive will be assumed by chairman jay b. <unk> \r\n for N years <unk> <unk> went to her neighborhood bank because it was convenient \r\n a <unk> customer that banks <unk> for she did n't give much thought to the rates she was receiving nor to the fees she was paying \r\n but in august first atlanta national bank introduced its crown account a package designed to lure customers such as ms. <unk> \r\n among other things it included checking safe deposit box and credit card all for free plus a good deal on installment loans \r\n all she had to do was put $ N in a certificate of deposit or qualify for a $ N personal line of credit \r\n i deserve something for my loyalty she says \r\n she took her business to first atlanta \r\n so it goes in the competitive world of consumer banking these days \r\n for nearly a decade banks have <unk> for customers primarily with the interest rates they pay on their deposits and charge on their loans \r\n the competitive rates were generally offset by hefty fees on various services \r\n but many banks are turning away from strict price competition \r\n instead they are trying to build customer loyalty by <unk> their services into packages and targeting them to small segments of the population \r\n you 're dead in the water if you are n't <unk> the market says anne moore president of <unk> research corp. a bank consulting firm in atlanta \r\n ncnb corp. of charlotte n.c. recently introduced its financial connections program aimed at young adults just starting careers \r\n the program not only offers a <unk> car loan up to $ N but throws in a special <unk> statement to help in saving money \r\n in september union <unk> corp. of memphis tenn. launched the edge account a package designed for the <unk> crowd with services that include a credit card and line of credit with no annual fees and a full percentage point off on installment loans \r\n the theory such individuals many with young children are in their prime borrowing years and having borrowed from the bank they may continue to use it for other services in later years \r\n for some time banks have been aiming packages at the elderly the <unk> segment with the highest savings \r\n those efforts are being stepped up \r\n <unk> macdonald vice president of retail sales at barnett banks inc. of <unk> fla. says the company now targets <unk> within the market by <unk> its popular seniors partners program to various life styles \r\n <unk> age geography and <unk> differences create numerous <unk> ms. macdonald says \r\n she says individual barnett branches can add different benefits to their seniors partners package such as athletic activities or travel clubs to appeal to local market interests \r\n an active <unk> in <unk> <unk> may care more about senior olympic games while a <unk> in panama city may care more about a <unk> on health she says \r\n banks have tried packaging before \r\n in N wells fargo & co. of san francisco launched the gold account which included free checking a credit card <unk> box and travelers checks for a $ N monthly fee \r\n the concept <unk> a slew of <unk> but the banks stopped promoting the packages \r\n one big reason thin margins \r\n many banks particularly smaller ones were slow to <unk> and could n't target market <unk> that would have made the programs more profitable \r\n as banks ' earnings were squeezed in the mid-1970s the emphasis switched to finding ways to cut costs \r\n but now computers are enabling more banks to analyze their customers by age income and geography \r\n they are better able to get to those segments in the wake of the deregulation that began in the late 1970s \r\n deregulation has effectively removed all restrictions on what banks can pay for deposits as well as opened up the field for new products such as <unk> cds \r\n where a bank once offered a standard <unk> savings account it began offering money-market accounts certificates of deposit and <unk> checking and staggering rates based on the size of deposits \r\n the competition has grown more intense as bigger banks such as <unk> corp. of minneapolis and chemical banking corp. of new york extend their market-share <unk> into small towns across the nation \r\n today a banker is worrying about local regional and <unk> banks as well as thrifts and credit unions says ms. moore at <unk> research \r\n so people who were n't even thinking about targeting N years ago are scrambling to define their customer base \r\n the competition has <unk> a much <unk> consumer \r\n the average household will spread N accounts over a dozen financial institutions says michael p. sullivan who runs his own bank consulting firm in charlotte n.c \r\n this much <unk> makes attracting and keeping today 's <unk> customers costly \r\n packages encourage loyalty by rewarding customers for doing the bulk of their banking in one place \r\n for their troubles the banks get a larger <unk> audience that is less likely to move at the drop of a rate \r\n the more accounts customers have mr. sullivan says the more likely they are to be attracted to a package and to be loyal to the bank that offers it \r\n that can pay off down the road as customers especially the younger ones change from borrowers to <unk> \r\n packaging has some <unk> \r\n the additional technology personnel training and promotional effort can be expensive \r\n chemical bank spent more than $ N million to introduce its <unk> line several packages aimed at different segments in N according to thomas jacob senior vice president of marketing \r\n it 's not easy to roll out something that comprehensive and make it pay mr. jacob says \r\n still bankers expect packaging to <unk> primarily because more customers are demanding that financial services be tailored to their needs \r\n these days banking customers walk in the door expecting you to have a package especially for them ms. moore says \r\n some banks are already moving in that direction according to alvin t. sale marketing director at first union corp. in charlotte \r\n first union he says now has packages for seven customer groups \r\n soon it will split those into N \r\n says mr. sale i think more banks are starting to realize that we have to be more like the department store not the <unk> \r\n iras \r\n <unk> inc. said it will <unk> a registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission to <unk> a plan to sell N newly issued common shares \r\n the chandler ariz. company said it will <unk> the registration to cover only the N million warrants each exercisable for the purchase of one common share \r\n currently <unk> has about N million common shares outstanding \r\n <unk> develops and markets low-cost software peripheral equipment and accessories for computers \r\n five things you can do for $ N or less \r\n N buy a new chevrolet \r\n N take a <unk> vacation \r\n N send your child to a university \r\n N buy a diamond <unk> \r\n N make a lasting difference in the regulatory life of an american savings-and-loan association through the foster corporate parents plan \r\n americans today spend $ N like <unk> change they do n't think much about it \r\n but for an ailing savings-and-loan association <unk> on <unk> it can lead to safety from imminent demise and to a future full of promise \r\n your $ N will help keep a <unk> savings and loan <unk> and out of the federal budget deficit \r\n as a foster corporate parent you 'll be helping a neighborhood s&l in areas crucial to its survival \r\n like healthy regulatory capital \r\n a steady deposit base \r\n performing loans \r\n at the same time you 'll give your foster savings institution the gift of hope and freedom from the federal regulators who want to close its doors for good \r\n as a foster corporate parent you will experience the same <unk> felt by robert bass lewis <unk> william simon and others who find ways to help troubled savings institutions and their employees help themselves \r\n that builds confidence <unk> <unk> not to mention critical regulatory net worth \r\n do n't wait a savings institution needs your help now \r\n every day you delay a savings institution 's health and the federal budget deficit grows worse \r\n think about the good you can do for just $ N a month about the cost of a <unk> chevrolet or two <unk> at a state university \r\n then send your support to a savings institution that has taken a bad <unk> in the press and on its bottom line \r\n every $ N you send will go a long way to boost sagging net worth and employee morale and keep your foster savings institution off the federal budget deficit \r\n mr. <unk> is a lawyer in new york \r\n the chicago mercantile exchange said it plans to institute an additional circuit breaker aimed at stemming market <unk> \r\n separately john phelan told a closed house subcommittee meeting in washington that he would support securities and exchange commission halts of program trading during market <unk> \r\n but the new york stock exchange chairman said he does n't support <unk> a collar on program trading arguing that firms could get around such a limit \r\n the chicago merc said a new one-hour price limit would take effect in its standard & poor 's N stock-index futures pit once s&p N futures fell N index points the equivalent of about a <unk> drop in the dow jones industrial average \r\n if the <unk> limit is triggered after N p.m chicago time it would remain in effect until the normal close of trading at N p.m \r\n with the limit in effect members would be able to execute trades at the limit price or at higher prices but not below it \r\n the exchange said it decided a new circuit breaker was needed following a review of the tumultuous trading in stocks and stock-index futures on friday oct. N when the dow jones industrials plunged N points and stock-index futures prices skidded as well \r\n late that afternoon the s&p N stock-index futures contract fell a total of N index points hitting a merc circuit breaker limit that remained in effect for the rest of the trading session \r\n the merc said that its existing <unk> <unk> limit on s&p N stock-index futures trading equal to about N points on the dow jones industrials which was triggered oct. N will remain in effect \r\n leo <unk> merc executive committee chairman said that the <unk> limit appeared to <unk> the selling panic oct. N \r\n but when the contract reopened the subsequent flood of sell orders that quickly knocked the contract down to the <unk> limit indicated that the intermediate limit of N points was needed to help keep stock and stock-index futures prices <unk> \r\n several traders maintained that the merc 's <unk> <unk> <unk> the market slide oct. N by <unk> additional selling pressure to the floor of the new york stock exchange \r\n all of the changes require regulatory approval which is expected shortly \r\n the exchange also said that the <unk> circuit breaker which currently provides only a one-hour <unk> during market <unk> will become the maximum one-day limit for the s&p N stock-index futures contract the one-day limit now is N index points \r\n a final <unk> was made to the <unk> opening limit for the contract \r\n the merc said that <unk> limit will remain in effect for the first N minutes of trading \r\n the limit <unk> under current exchange rules if contracts trade above the limit price during the opening N minutes of trading \r\n in washington house aides said mr. phelan told congressmen that the collar which banned program trades through the big board 's computer when the dow jones industrial average moved N points did n't work well \r\n he said that firms could get around the collar by executing trades <unk> \r\n in a <unk> news conference mr. phelan who has publicly expressed concern about market volatility said he told the house finance and telecommunications subcommittee that he would support the program-trading halt proposal providing the sec would be comfortable with the language in a bill \r\n the program-trading issue is heating up on capitol hill as it is on wall street and several legislators want to grant the sec the power to shut off the programs when trading becomes too volatile \r\n sec chairman richard breeden has said he would be willing to consider circuit breakers that have <unk> trigger points but he does n't want discretionary power to stop programs \r\n a house aide suggested that mr. phelan was so vague and <unk> that it was the kind of meeting where people of all <unk> could come out feeling good \r\n at one point mr. phelan angered the subcommittee 's chairman rep. edward markey d. mass. by not going much beyond what already had been reported in the morning newspapers \r\n markey said we could have done this in public because so little sensitive information was disclosed the aide said \r\n mr. phelan then responded that he would have been happy just writing a report to the panel the aide added \r\n at another point during the hearing rep. markey asked mr. phelan what would be discussed at a new york exchange board meeting today \r\n mr. phelan said the big board is likely to study the program-trading issue \r\n that response <unk> rep. markey house aides said and the congressman snapped back that there had been enough studies of the issue and that it was time for action on the matter \r\n <unk> of the N subcommittee members attended the hearing most notably rep. john dingell d. mich. the full house energy and commerce committee chairman who has been willing to let mr. markey carry the legislation in recent months \r\n mr. dingell expressed concern sources said about <unk> problems in <unk> program trading which uses futures to offset stock trades \r\n the futures industry is regulated by the commodity futures trading commission which reports to the agriculture committees in both houses \r\n the art of <unk> is <unk> to the english and like most english <unk> <unk> to the rest of the world \r\n <unk> l. <unk> the nine <unk> \r\n <unk> england \r\n of all scenes that <unk> rural england this is one of the <unk> an ancient stone church stands amid the fields the sound of bells <unk> from its tower calling the <unk> to <unk> \r\n the <unk> of st. michael and all angels stop to <unk> at the church door as members here always have \r\n in the tower five men and women pull <unk> on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in N \r\n but there is also a <unk> modern note in <unk> though it ca n't be heard by the <unk> enjoying the <unk> of bells this cool autumn evening \r\n like most of the other N <unk> in britain with sets of bells st. michael once had its own band of ringers who would herald every sunday morning and evening service \r\n now only one local ringer remains <unk> <unk> hammond \r\n the others here today live elsewhere \r\n they belong to a group of N ringers including two <unk> and four youngsters in training who drive every sunday from church to church in a <unk> effort to keep the bells <unk> in the many <unk> of east <unk> \r\n to ring for even one service at this tower we have to <unk> says mr. hammond a retired <unk> worker \r\n we 've tried to train the youngsters but they have their <unk> and their <unk> and they just <unk> away \r\n mr. hammond worries that old age and the <unk> of youth will <unk> the ranks of the east <unk> group that keeps the <unk> bells <unk> \r\n history after all is not on his side \r\n according to a nationwide survey taken a year ago nearly a third of england 's church bells are no longer <unk> on <unk> because there is no one to ring them \r\n it is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes \r\n the less complicated version of playing <unk> on bells as do the <unk> of continental europe is considered by the english to be <unk> fit only for foreigners \r\n <unk> a <unk> exercise the english invented N years ago requires physical <unk> some bells weigh more than a ton combined with intense mental concentration \r\n proper english bells are started off in <unk> from the <unk> bell to the lowest a simple <unk> scale using in larger <unk> as many as N bells \r\n then at a signal the ringers begin <unk> the order in which the bells sound without <unk> the steady <unk> of the striking \r\n each <unk> or change can occur only once the rules state \r\n ringers <unk> patterns of changes known as methods which have <unk> names like kent <unk> bob major or <unk> <unk> \r\n a series of N or so changes is a <unk> and takes about three hours \r\n a look at a thursday night practice at st. mary <unk> church in the <unk> district of london gives an idea of the work involved \r\n ten <unk> ringers stand in a circle one foot ahead of the other in a <unk> 's stance each pulling a <unk> that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber \r\n no one speaks and the <unk> of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves <unk> by the ceiling \r\n totally absorbed the ringers <unk> straight ahead using peripheral vision they call it <unk> to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls \r\n far above in the <unk> the huge <unk> bells mounted on wheels swing <unk> through a full N degrees starting and ending surprisingly in the <unk> or <unk> position \r\n skilled ringers use their <unk> to advance or <unk> the next swing so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change \r\n in a well-known <unk> involving church bells english novelist <unk> l. <unk> described ringing as a passion that finds its satisfaction in <unk> <unk> and mechanical <unk> \r\n ringers she added are filled with the <unk> <unk> that comes of <unk> <unk> <unk> performed \r\n ringing does become a bit of an <unk> admits <unk> <unk> master of the band at st. mary <unk> and one of england 's best female ringers \r\n it is a passion that usually stays in the tower however \r\n more often than not ringers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the <unk> \r\n when their changes are completed and after they have worked up a sweat ringers often <unk> off to the local <unk> leaving <unk> for others below \r\n this does not sit well with some <unk> \r\n with membership of the church of england steadily <unk> <unk> <unk> are pressing equally <unk> and often <unk> ringers to attend services \r\n two years ago the rev. <unk> <unk> vicar of great <unk> <unk> got so fed up with ringers who did n't attend service he <unk> the entire band the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest \r\n they were a <unk> club that treated the tower as sort of a separate premises the vicar <unk> says \r\n an entirely new band <unk> today at great <unk> several of whom are members of the <unk> \r\n but there still are n't enough ringers to ring more than six of the eight bells \r\n at st. mary 's church in <unk> <unk> the bells have fallen silent following a <unk> over church attendance \r\n the vicar <unk> jones refuses to talk about it saying it would reopen the wound \r\n but <unk> marshall vicar of a nearby church feels the fault is in the <unk> from the bell tower that are located next to the <unk> \r\n so crunch crunch crunch bang bang bang here come the ringers from above making a very obvious exit while the <unk> is at <unk> he says \r\n vicar marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue since he is both a vicar and an active <unk> himself \r\n the sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church he says \r\n i live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that <unk> life \r\n the central council of church bell ringers a sort of parliament of ringing groups aims to improve relations with <unk> says john c. baldwin president \r\n it hopes to speak to students at <unk> colleges about the <unk> of bell ringing and will shortly publish a <unk> for every vicar in the country entitled the bells in your care \r\n says mr. baldwin we recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience \r\n mr. baldwin is also attacking the greater problem lack of ringers \r\n one survey says that of the N trained <unk> in england today only N of them still ring \r\n also ringers do n't always live where the bells need to be <unk> like in small rural <unk> and inner-city <unk> \r\n but the council 's program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful says mr. baldwin \r\n right now we 're lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of N he adds \r\n one bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once <unk> field more than a third of the ringers today are women \r\n they are n't accepted everywhere however \r\n the oldest <unk> group in the country the ancient society of college <unk> founded in N remains <unk> a fact that 's particularly <unk> to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for britain 's most prestigious <unk> st. paul 's <unk> and <unk> <unk> \r\n this being britain no woman has filed an <unk> suit but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to the ringing world a weekly newspaper for ringers \r\n one writer signing his letter as <unk> balanced male <unk> on the frequency of women <unk> in <unk> and suggested that they settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings \r\n in the <unk> of replies that followed one woman ringer from <unk> observed that the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be <unk> badly dressed <unk> with <unk> and a large <unk> frequently <unk> and <unk> <unk> in <unk> \r\n another women wrote from <unk> to say that in her N years of ringing i have never known a lady to <unk> in the <unk> \r\n i have seen one or two men die <unk> them \r\n investors unsettled by the stock market 's gyrations can take some comfort in the predictable <unk> of quarterly dividend checks \r\n that has been particularly true this year with many companies raising their payouts more than N N \r\n but do n't <unk> too easy those dividend increases may signal trouble ahead for stock prices some analysts warn \r\n in the past they say the strongest dividend growth has often come at times when the stock-market party was almost over \r\n that can be a trap for <unk> investors says richard bernstein senior <unk> analyst at merrill lynch & co \r\n strong dividend growth he says is the black widow of valuation a reference to the female <unk> that attract males and then kill them after <unk> \r\n stephen boesel president of t. rowe price growth and income fund explains that companies raise their payouts most <unk> only after the economy and corporate profits have been growing for some time \r\n invariably those strong periods in the economy give way to <unk> environments he says \r\n and <unk> environments are n't <unk> to the stock market \r\n indeed analysts say that payouts have sometimes risen most sharply when prices were already on their way down from cyclical <unk> \r\n in N for example dividends on the stocks in standard & poor 's 500-stock index soared N N following much slower growth the year before \r\n the s&p index started sliding in price in september N and fell N N in N despite a N N expansion in dividends that year \r\n that pattern has n't always held but recent strong growth in dividends makes some market watchers anxious \r\n payouts on the s&p N stocks rose N N in N according to standard & poor 's corp. and wall street estimates for N growth are generally between N N and N N \r\n many people believe the growth in dividends will slow next year although a minority see double-digit gains continuing \r\n meanwhile many market watchers say recent dividend trends raise another warning flag while dividends have risen <unk> their expansion has n't kept pace with even stronger advances in stock prices \r\n as a result the market 's dividend yield dividends as a percentage of price has slid to a level that is fairly low and <unk> by historical standards \r\n put another way the decline in the yield suggests stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends they pay some market analysts say \r\n they are keeping a close watch on the yield on the s&p N \r\n the figure is currently about N N up from N N before the recent market slide \r\n some analysts say investors should run for the <unk> if a sustained market rebound <unk> the yield below N N \r\n a drop below that N N benchmark has always been a strong warning sign that stocks are fully valued says mr. boesel of t. rowe price \r\n in fact the market has always <unk> \r\n always \r\n there 's never been an exception says gerald w. <unk> a chicago investment adviser and money manager based on a review of six decades of stock-market data \r\n the last time the s&p N yield dropped below N N was in the summer of N \r\n stockholders who took the hint and sold shares escaped the october debacle \r\n there have been only seven other times in N N N N N N and N when the yield on the s&p N dropped below N N for at least two consecutive months mr. <unk> found \r\n and in each case he says a sharp drop in stock prices began within a year \r\n still some market analysts say the current N N reading is n't as troublesome as it might have been in years past \r\n it 's not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not <unk> in a traditional manner says james h. <unk> head of stock investments for cigna corp. the <unk> insurer \r\n in particular mr. <unk> says businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends than they have historically \r\n so while stock prices may look fairly high relative to dividends they are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength \r\n rather than increasing dividends some companies have used cash to buy back some of their shares notes steven g. einhorn <unk> of the investment policy committee at goldman sachs & co \r\n he factors that into the market yield to get an adjusted yield of about N N \r\n that is just a <unk> below the average of the past N years or so he says \r\n what will happen to dividend growth next year \r\n common wisdom suggests a <unk> rate of growth reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate profits \r\n painewebber inc. for instance is forecasting growth in s&p N dividends of just under N N in N down from an estimated N N this year \r\n in other years in which there have been moderate economic <unk> the environment the firm expects in N the change in dividends ranged from a gain of N N to a decline of N N according to painewebber analyst thomas <unk> \r\n the minority argument meanwhile is that businesses have the financial <unk> this time around to declare sharply higher dividends even if their earnings weaken \r\n dividend growth on the order of N N is expected by both mr. <unk> of cigna and mr. einhorn of goldman sachs \r\n those dividend bulls argue that corporations are in the unusual position of having plenty of cash left over after paying dividends and making capital expenditures \r\n one indicator investors might want to watch is the monthly tally from standard & poor 's of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends \r\n a total of N companies raised dividends in october basically unchanged from N a year ago s&p said wednesday \r\n that followed four straight months in which the number of increases trailed the year-earlier pace \r\n while the s&p tally does n't measure the magnitude of dividend changes a further <unk> in the number of dividend increases could be a <unk> of slower dividend growth next year \r\n in any case opinion is mixed on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get even if dividend growth continues at double-digit levels \r\n mr. einhorn of goldman sachs estimates the stock market will deliver a N N to N N total return from appreciation and dividends over the next N months vs. a cash rate of return of perhaps N N or N N if dividend growth is weak \r\n but mr. boesel of t. rowe price who also expects N N growth in dividends next year does n't think it will help the overall market all that much \r\n having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook but i do n't think it 's a main consideration he says \r\n with slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings likely next year i would n't look for the market to have much upside from current levels \r\n your oct.

was so far above his <unk> \r\n moving rapidly through school he <unk> <unk> beta <unk> from the university of kentucky at age N after spending only N N years in college \r\n he earned his <unk> in nuclear physics from the massachusetts institute of technology \r\n mr. hahn agrees that he has a <unk> memory but friends say that 's an <unk> \r\n they call it photographic \r\n mr. hahn also has engineered a surprising turnaround of georgia-pacific \r\n taking over as chief executive officer in N he inherited a company that was mired in debt and hurt by a <unk> slide in its <unk> business \r\n mr. hahn began selling <unk> businesses such as oil and gas and chemicals \r\n he even sold one unit that made <unk> <unk> covers \r\n at the same time he began building up the pulp and paper segment of the company while <unk> building products on home repair and remodeling rather than materials for new-home construction \r\n the idea was to buffet building products from cycles in new-home construction \r\n the formula has paid off so far \r\n georgia-pacific 's sales climbed to $ N billion last year compared with $ N billion in N when mr. hahn took the reins \r\n profit from continuing operations has soared to $ N million from $ N million \r\n mr. hahn attributes the gains to the philosophy of concentrating on what a company knows best \r\n the record of companies that have diversified is n't all that impressive he says \r\n nekoosa would n't be a diversification \r\n it would be a good match mr. hahn and many analysts say of two healthy companies with high-quality assets and strong cash flows \r\n the resulting company would be the largest forest-products concern in the world with combined sales of more than $ N billion \r\n but can mr. hahn carry it off \r\n in this instance industry observers say he is entering <unk> waters \r\n says <unk> <unk> an analyst at first manhattan co. this is the greatest acquisition challenge he has faced \r\n a house-senate conference approved major portions of a package for more than $ N million in economic aid for poland that relies heavily on $ N million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal N in hopes of <unk> future trade and investment \r\n for the agency for international development <unk> approved $ N million in secondary loan guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program and total loan guarantees for the overseas private investment corp. are increased by $ N million over fiscal N as part of the same poland package \r\n the conference approved at least $ N million in direct cash and development assistance as well and though no decision was made both sides are committed to adding more than $ N million in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought by the bush administration \r\n the agreement on poland contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill which has already provoked veto threats by the white house and is sharply confined under this year 's budget \r\n these fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the poland package and while more ambitious <unk> legislation is still pending the appropriations bill in conference will be more decisive on u.s. aid to eastern europe \r\n to accommodate the additional cash assistance the house appropriations committee last week was required to <unk> an estimated $ N million from the pentagon \r\n and though the size of the loan guarantees approved yesterday is significant recent experience with a similar program in central america indicates that it could take several years before the new polish government can fully use the aid effectively \r\n the action on poland came as the conference separately approved $ N million for international population planning activities an N N increase over fiscal N \r\n the house and senate are divided over whether the united nations population fund will receive any portion of these appropriations but the size of the increase is itself significant \r\n in a second area of common concern the world environment an additional $ N million will be provided in development assistance to fund a series of initiatives related both to global warming and the plight of the african elephant \r\n the sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety of special interest amendments running from an import exemption for a california <unk> museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of panama 's quota of exports to the profitable u.s. market \r\n panama was stripped of this right because of u.s. differences with the noriega regime but the central american country would have received a quota of N metric tons over a <unk> period ending sept. N N \r\n about a quarter of this share has already been <unk> according to the industry but the remaining N tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current u.s. price of N cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world rate \r\n the potential sales are nearly $ N million and house majority whip william gray d. pa began the bidding this year by proposing language that the quota be allocated to <unk> countries of the caribbean such as jamaica and <unk> \r\n rep. jerry lewis a conservative <unk> added a provision of his own intended to assist <unk> and the senate then <unk> the list further by including all countries in the u.s. caribbean basin <unk> as well as the philippines backed by the powerful hawaii democrat sen. daniel inouye \r\n jamaica wary of <unk> its caribbean basin allies has apparently instructed its lobbyist to abandon the provision initially drafted by mr. gray but the greater question is whether mr. inouye who has strong ties to the sugar industry is able to <unk> a claim by the philippines \r\n in separate floor action the house <unk> budget restrictions and gave quick approval to $ N billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs in fiscal N \r\n the funding is attached to an estimated $ N billion transportation bill that goes next to the senate and carries with it a proposed permanent smoking ban on virtually all u.s. domestic airline flights \r\n the leadership hopes to move the compromise measure promptly to the white house but in recent days the senate has been as likely to bounce bills back to the house \r\n the most recent example was a nearly $ N billion fiscal N bill funding the state justice and commerce departments \r\n and after losing a battle tuesday night with the senate foreign relations committee <unk> from both houses are expected to be forced back to conference \r\n beauty takes <unk> to safety on bridges \r\n everyone agrees that most of the nation 's old bridges need to be repaired or replaced \r\n but there 's disagreement over how to do it \r\n highway officials insist the <unk> <unk> on older bridges are n't strong enough to prevent vehicles from <unk> through \r\n but other people do n't want to lose the bridges ' beautiful sometimes historic features \r\n the primary purpose of a <unk> is to contain a vehicle and not to provide a <unk> view says jack white a planner with the indiana highway department \r\n he and others prefer to install <unk> such as the type f safety shape a <unk> concrete <unk> with no <unk> \r\n in richmond ind. the type f <unk> is being used to replace <unk> <unk> on the <unk> street bridge \r\n <unk> boone who teaches art at <unk> college calls the new structure just an <unk> bridge and one that blocks the view of a new park below \r\n in hartford conn. the charter oak bridge will soon be replaced the <unk> <unk> from its <unk> <unk> to a park \r\n <unk> are possible \r\n citizens in peninsula ohio upset over changes to a bridge negotiated a deal the bottom half of the <unk> will be type f while the top half will have the old bridge 's <unk> pattern \r\n similarly highway engineers agreed to keep the old <unk> on the key bridge in washington d.c. as long as they could install a crash barrier between the sidewalk and the road \r\n <unk> <unk> \r\n drink carrier competes

\r\n the company acknowledges some problems \r\n a driver has to find something to hang the carrier on so the company supplies a window hook \r\n while it breaks down in prolonged <unk> it is n't

\r\n the event continues into next year and includes an exchange program to swap design teachers at <unk> and <unk> 's <unk> institute \r\n dan <unk> leader of the <unk> group sees benefits all around \r\n the soviets who normally have few clients other than the state will get exposure to a market system he says \r\n americans will learn more about making products for the soviets \r\n mr. <unk> says the soviets could even help u.s. designers renew their sense of purpose \r\n in moscow they kept asking us things like why do you make N different <unk> when all you need is one good one he says \r\n they got us thinking maybe we should be helping u.s. companies improve existing products rather than always developing new ones \r\n seed for jail solution fails to take root \r\n it 's a two

however calls the idea not effective or cost efficient \r\n the labor department cited usx corp. for numerous health and safety violations at two pennsylvania plants and proposed $ N million in fines the largest penalty ever proposed for alleged workplace violations by an employer \r\n the department 's <unk> safety and health administration proposed fines of $ N million for alleged violations at the company 's <unk> hills pa. steel mill that was a record for proposed penalties at any single facility \r\n osha cited nearly N alleged violations of federal electrical <unk> <unk> and other requirements \r\n a second <unk> covering the company 's <unk> pa. coke works involved more than N alleged violations of <unk> and other requirements for which osha proposed $ N million in fines \r\n labor secretary elizabeth dole said the magnitude of these penalties and <unk> is matched only by the magnitude of the hazards to workers which resulted from corporate <unk> to worker safety and health and severe cutbacks in the maintenance and repair programs needed to remove those hazards \r\n osha said there have been three worker <unk> at the two plants in the past two years and N deaths since N \r\n gerard <unk> the head of osha said usx managers have known about many of the safety and health deficiencies at the plants for years yet have failed to take necessary action to <unk> the hazards \r\n particularly <unk> mrs. dole said are the company 's numerous failures to properly record injuries at its <unk> works in spite of the firm promise it had made in an earlier <unk> settlement agreement to correct such discrepancies \r\n that settlement was in april N \r\n a usx spokesman said the company had n't yet received any documents from osha regarding the penalty or fine \r\n once we do they will receive very serious evaluation the spokesman said \r\n no consideration is more important than the health and safety of our employees \r\n usx said it has been <unk> with osha since the agency began investigating the <unk> and <unk> works \r\n he said that if and when safety problems were identified they were corrected \r\n the usx <unk> represented the first sizable enforcement action taken by osha under mr. <unk> \r\n he has promised <unk> fines though the size of penalties sought by osha have been rising in recent years even before he took office this year \r\n the big problem is that usx management has proved unwilling to devote the necessary resources and manpower to removing hazards and to <unk> safety and health in the plants said linda <unk> osha regional administrator in philadelphia \r\n usx has N working days to contest the <unk> and proposed penalties before the independent <unk> safety and health review commission \r\n before the usx case osha 's largest proposed fine for one employer was $ N million for alleged safety violations at john <unk> & co. a <unk> subsidiary of united brands co. cincinnati \r\n the company is <unk> the fine

N editorial the ill homeless referred to research by us and six of our colleagues that was reported in the sept. N issue of the journal of the american medical association \r\n your comments implied we had discovered that the principal cause of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of <unk> ill and <unk> people in the homeless population \r\n we have made no such statement \r\n it is clear that most <unk> ill people and most <unk> do not become homeless \r\n the causes of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case \r\n in <unk> from our research you emphasized the high <unk> of mental illness and <unk> \r\n you did not note that the homeless people we examined had a <unk> of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse \r\n they suffered from <unk> <unk> diseases cardiovascular disorders skin problems <unk> diseases and the <unk> of <unk> and rape \r\n homeless people not only lack safety privacy and shelter they also lack the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and basic health care \r\n in a recent report the institute of medicine pointed out that certain health problems may <unk> a person to homelessness others may be a consequence of it and a third category is composed of disorders whose treatment is difficult or impossible if a person lacks adequate shelter \r\n the <unk> between health and homelessness are complex <unk> sweeping <unk> as to cause or effect \r\n if we look to the future preventing homelessness is an important objective \r\n this will require us to develop a much more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of homelessness than we currently <unk> an understanding that can be developed only through careful study and research \r\n william r. <unk> <unk> <unk> j. <unk> <unk> department of <unk> johns hopkins university school of medicine baltimore \r\n a study by <unk> prof. james wright says homelessness is due to a complex array of problems with the common <unk> of poverty \r\n the study shows that nearly N N of the homeless population is made up of women and children and that only N N of the homeless <unk> some combination of drug alcohol and mental problems \r\n according to dr. wright homelessness is simultaneously a housing problem an employment problem a <unk> problem a problem of social <unk> a mental health problem a family violence problem a problem created by the cutbacks in social welfare spending a problem resulting from the <unk> of the traditional nuclear family and a problem <unk> connected to the recent increase in the number of persons living below the poverty level \r\n <unk> e. <unk> <unk> president robert wood johnson foundation princeton

other than drink drugs or <unk> \r\n maxwell <unk> <unk> brooklyn n.y \r\n you dismiss as <unk> the view that the reduction of federal <unk> programs by N N might have played a significant role in the increased number of men and women sleeping on our city streets during the <unk> years \r\n there is no sign that you bothered to consider the <unk> of your logic namely that mental illness and substance abuse might be to some degree consequences rather than causes of homelessness \r\n your research stopped when a convenient <unk> could be made \r\n robert s. <unk> cambridge mass \r\n of the approximately N sponsors of the recent march in washington for the homeless you chose to cite such groups as the national association of home builders and the international union of <unk> and allied

that participated in the march \r\n as for the findings on the N baltimore homeless who <unk> psychiatric <unk> i suggest you conduct your own survey \r\n choose N business executives including perhaps someone from your own staff and put them out on the streets to be deprived for one month of their homes families and income \r\n i would predict that within a short time most of them would find <unk> a satisfactory substitute for chivas <unk> and that their normal <unk> <unk> <unk> and substance abuse would increase dramatically \r\n ruth k. nelson <unk> n.c \r\n rogers communications inc. said it plans to raise N million to N million canadian dollars us$ N million to $ N million through a private placement of perpetual preferred shares \r\n perpetual preferred shares are n't <unk>

spokesman for the toronto cable television and telecommunications concern said the coupon rate has n't yet been fixed but will probably be set at around N N \r\n he declined to discuss other terms of the issue \r\n the house passed legislation designed to make it easier for the transportation department to block airline leveraged buy-outs \r\n the final vote came after the house rejected republican efforts to weaken the bill and approved two amendments sought by organized labor \r\n the bush administration has threatened to veto such a bill because of what it views as an <unk> <unk> into the affairs of industry but the N vote suggests that supporters have the potential to override a veto \r\n the broader question is where the senate stands on the issue \r\n while the senate commerce committee has approved legislation similar to the house bill on airline leveraged buy-outs the measure has n't yet come to the full floor \r\n although the legislation would apply to acquisitions involving any major airline it is aimed at giving the transportation department the chance to review in advance transactions financed by large amounts of debt \r\n the purpose of the bill is to put the <unk> on airline acquisitions that would so load a carrier up with debt that it would <unk> safety or a carrier 's ability to compete rep. john paul <unk> r. ark said \r\n the bill as it was approved by the house public works and transportation committee would give the transportation department up to N days to review any purchase of N N or more of the stock in an airline \r\n the department would be required to block the buy-out if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be <unk> its ability to compete would be sharply diminished it would be put into foreign control or if the transaction would result in the sale of <unk> assets unless selling such assets had an <unk> public benefit \r\n the house approved an amendment offered by rep. peter <unk> d. ore. that would in addition to the previous criteria also require the department to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred were likely to result in a reduction in the number of the carrier 's employees or their wages or benefits \r\n rep. james <unk> d. ohio said the amendment which passed N would let the american worker know that we consider them occasionally \r\n but rep. <unk> said that the provision which he dubbed a special interest amendment was likely to make the bill even more controversial \r\n on tuesday the house approved a <unk> amendment that would require the transportation department to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking to purchase a carrier had run two or more airlines previously that have filed for protection from creditors under chapter N of the federal bankruptcy code \r\n the provision called the <unk> amendment by its supporters apparently was aimed at preventing texas air corp. chairman frank lorenzo from attempting to take over another airline \r\n <unk> report \r\n you now may drop by the voice of america offices in washington and read the text of what the voice is broadcasting to those N million people around the world who tune in to it each week \r\n you can even take notes extensive notes for the voice folks wo n't look over your shoulder about what you read \r\n you can do all this even if you 're not a reporter or a researcher or a scholar or a member of congress \r\n and my newspaper can print the text of those <unk> \r\n until the other day you as an ordinary citizen of this democracy had no right to see what your government was telling your <unk> around the world \r\n that was the law \r\n and i apparently had no right to print <unk> what the voice was booming to <unk> \r\n it was censorship \r\n it was <unk> \r\n and it was stupid \r\n the theory was that the voice is a propaganda agency and this government should n't <unk> its own people \r\n that sounds neat but this government any government <unk> its own people every day \r\n government press releases <unk> <unk> tours of military facilities publications are all propaganda of sorts \r\n propaganda is just information to support a viewpoint and the beauty of a democracy is that it enables you to hear or read every viewpoint and then make up your own mind on an issue \r\n the restrictions on <unk> and <unk> of voice material were especially absurd an agency in the information business was not being allowed to inform \r\n in june N i wrote in this space about this issue \r\n assuming it was n't one of those columns that you <unk> and put on the <unk> door i 'll review the facts \r\n the voice of america is a government agency that <unk> news and views some might say propaganda in N <unk> to N million <unk> around the world \r\n it does a <unk> job \r\n its budget $ N million is paid for by you \r\n but a N law barred the <unk> of that material in the u.s. \r\n the law let scholars reporters and researchers read <unk> of <unk> material only at <unk> headquarters in washington but it barred them from copying <unk> \r\n and of course there 's that word <unk> \r\n how 's that again \r\n you may come by the agency to read but not copy either <unk> or by <unk> a voice official explained when i asked \r\n what if i tune in my <unk> radio <unk> an editorial or program and print it in my newspaper \r\n nor are you free to <unk> such material i was advised \r\n that sounded a lot like censorship so after years of letters and conversations that went nowhere i sued \r\n a couple of weeks ago i lost the case in federal district court in des <unk> \r\n at least that 's the way it was reported \r\n and indeed the lawsuit was dismissed \r\n but i i like to think of it in terms of we all of us won the point \r\n for a funny thing happened on the way to the ruling the united states information agency which runs the voice changed its position on three key points \r\n the usia said that on reflection of course i could print anything i could get my hands on \r\n the word <unk> it decided referred only to itself \r\n the usia officially and publicly declared the <unk> right of everyone except the usia to <unk> agency program materials in the united states my lawyer the <unk> mark mccormick of des <unk> said in a memo pointing out the facts and trying to make me feel good after the press reported that i had lost \r\n the court noted the new usia position but just in case officially found that congress did not intend to preclude plaintiffs from <unk> usia information domestically \r\n the usia said that on reflection anyone could view the <unk> materials not just the reporters scholars researchers and congressmen who are mentioned in the statute \r\n the usia publicly and officially stated in the litigation that all persons are allowed access to the materials notwithstanding the statutory <unk> because the usia has determined that it will not check the credentials of any person appearing and <unk> to see the materials mr. mccormick noted \r\n and the usia said that all of us could take extensive notes \r\n the agency publicly and officially declared in the lawsuit that persons who examine the materials may make notes and while the agency position is that persons may not take <unk> notes no one will check to determine what notes a person has taken mr. mccormick reported \r\n i had sought in my suit the right to print voice material which had been denied me and i had sought a right to receive the information arguing in effect that a right to print government information is n't very helpful if i have no right to get the information \r\n but the court disagreed \r\n the first amendment <unk> the government from passing laws <unk> the right to free speech judge donald o'brien ruled \r\n the first amendment does not <unk> a duty upon the government to assure easy access to information for members of the press \r\n so now the situation is this \r\n you have a right to read voice of america scripts if you do n't mind traveling to washington every week or so and visiting the voice office during business hours \r\n i have a right to print those scripts if i go there and <unk> but no longer <unk> copy them out in long hand \r\n but neither of us can copy the material on a xerox machine or have it sent to us \r\n in an era when every government agency has a public-relations machine that sends you stuff whether you want it or not this does seem odd \r\n indeed judge o'brien ruled that it would be easy to conclude that the usia 's position is inappropriate or even stupid but it 's the law \r\n so the next step i suspect is to try to get the law changed \r\n we i assume you 're in this with me at this point need to get three words for examination only eliminated from the law \r\n section N of the united states information and educational exchange act of N says voice material shall be available to certain of us but now thanks to the usia 's new position all of us for examination only \r\n if those words were n't there the nice people at the voice would be able to send you the information or at the very least let you <unk> it \r\n this is not a <unk> issue \r\n you have raised important questions which ought to be answered what does usia say about america abroad how do we say it and how can american taxpayers get the answers to these questions a man wrote me a couple of years ago \r\n the man was charles <unk> <unk> \r\n at the time he was director of the \r\n he had no answers then \r\n

N \r\n for fiscal N mr. mcgovern received a salary of $ N \r\n he owns about N shares of campbell stock and has options to buy more than N additional shares \r\n he will be eligible for an annual pension of more than $ N with certain other <unk> benefits \r\n during mr. mcgovern 's <unk> term as president the company 's sales rose to $ N billion from $ N billion and net income increased to $ N million from $ N million the statement said \r\n mr. baum said he and mr. harper both <unk> closing some plants as long ago as early N \r\n you 've got to make the restructuring work said mr. baum \r\n you 've got to make those savings now \r\n mr. harper expressed confidence that he and mr. baum can convince the board of their <unk> to run the company \r\n we look upon this as a great opportunity to prove the fact that we have a tremendous management team he said \r\n he predicted that the board would give the current duo until early next year before naming a new chief executive \r\n mr. baum said the two have orders to focus on <unk> profits and to take a hard look at our businesses what is good what is not so good \r\n analysts generally <unk> the performance of campbell u.s.a. the company 's largest division which posted N N unit sales growth and a N N improvement in operating profit for fiscal N \r\n the way that we 've been managing campbell u.s.a. can hopefully spread to other areas of the company mr. baum said \r\n in the interview at headquarters yesterday afternoon both men <unk> confidence and seemed to work well together \r\n you 've got two <unk> sitting right before you said mr. baum \r\n we play to win \r\n wednesday november N N \r\n the key u.s. and foreign annual interest rates below are a guide to general levels but do n't always represent actual transactions \r\n prime rate N N N \r\n the base rate on corporate loans at large u.s. money center commercial banks \r\n federal funds N N N high N N N low N N N near closing bid N N offered \r\n reserves traded among commercial banks for overnight use in amounts of $ N million or more \r\n source fulton prebon u.s.a inc \r\n discount rate N N \r\n the charge on loans to depository institutions by the new york federal reserve bank \r\n call money N N N \r\n the charge on loans to brokers on stock exchange collateral \r\n commercial paper placed directly by general motors acceptance corp.

N and work with his successor who is to be named soon \r\n mr. newhouse meanwhile insisted that he is n't unhappy with mr. bernstein or the performance of random house the largest trade publishing house in the u.s. \r\n the company said the publisher 's annual sales volume increased to $ N million from $ N million during mr. bernstein 's tenure \r\n bob has handled the extraordinary growth of the company quite <unk> said mr. newhouse \r\n the company is doing well it 's stable it 's got good people \r\n bob has an agenda and this seemed like the natural time \r\n publishing officials believe that while random house has enjoyed spectacular growth and has smoothly integrated many acquisitions in recent years some of the bigger ones have n't been absorbed so easily \r\n crown publishing group acquired last year is said to be turning in disappointing results \r\n as a private company random house does n't report its earnings \r\n mr. bernstein who succeeded bennett <unk> has been only the second president of random house since it was founded in N \r\n speculation on his successor centers on a number of division heads at the house \r\n possible candidates include susan <unk> president of <unk> <unk> random house 's huge and successful <unk> division \r\n some say anthony <unk> head of a recently acquired british company century hutchinson could be chosen \r\n there is also speculation that mr. newhouse could bring in a powerhouse businessman or another newhouse family member to run the business side in combination with a publishing executive like robert <unk> who left random house 's alfred a. <unk> to run the new yorker also owned by the newhouse family \r\n not included on the <unk> list are <unk> evans recruited two years ago to be publisher of adult trade books for random house and <unk> mehta president of the prestigious alfred a. <unk> unit \r\n when ms. evans took her job several important divisions that had reported to her predecessor were n't included partly because she did n't wish to be a full-time administrator \r\n mr. mehta is widely viewed as a brilliant editor but a <unk> administrator and his own departure was rumored recently \r\n mr. bernstein a tall energetic man who is widely respected as a publishing executive has spent much of his time in recent years on human rights issues \r\n congress learned during the reagan administration that it could <unk> the executive branch by <unk> again and again the same seven words provided that no funds shall be spent \r\n this phrase once again is found throughout the many appropriations bills now moving through congress \r\n it signals congress 's attempt under the <unk> of <unk> the public <unk> to deny the president the funding necessary to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified in article ii of the constitution \r\n this <unk> of congressional action is <unk> on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is <unk> and unconstitutional \r\n the appropriations clause states that no money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law \r\n the prevailing interpretation of the clause on capitol hill is that it gives congress an <unk> veto over every <unk> action of the president through the ability to <unk> funding \r\n this interpretation was officially endorsed by congress in N in the iran-contra report \r\n as <unk> of congressional power understand a power of the <unk> so broadly <unk> would <unk> the presidency and <unk> the principle of separation of powers \r\n it is not supported by the text or history of the constitution \r\n the <unk> hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the constitutional convention of N according to madison 's notes \r\n to the extent they did their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability \r\n moreover the <unk> believed that the nation needed a <unk> executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the confederation congress had performed poorly under the articles of confederation \r\n it would <unk> that objective if the appropriations clause technically a <unk> on legislative power could be read as placing the president on congress 's short <unk> making the executive consist of the president and every member of congress \r\n as it went to the conference panel now <unk> the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal N contained some <unk> attempts by congress to rewrite the constitution under the <unk> of protecting the public 's money \r\n during the coming weeks president bush must decide whether to veto the bills containing them or alternatively to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their <unk> on executive power to be in violation of article ii and thus <unk> and <unk> \r\n the N appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by article ii \r\n article ii places on the president the duty to <unk> and by and with the advice and consent of the senate <unk> <unk> judges and other officers of the u.s. \r\n it also <unk> the president to make <unk> appointments without senate approval the president shall have power to fill up all <unk> that may happen during the <unk> of the senate by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session \r\n yet section N of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides no part of any <unk> for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been <unk> after the senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person \r\n thus with one brief passage in an appropriations bill congress <unk> the president 's power to make <unk> appointments under article ii \r\n section N also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to <unk> candidates of his choosing \r\n the language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected <unk> will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person 's salary \r\n the president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay because the <unk> act prohibits voluntary service to the government \r\n the N appropriations bills also contain a number of <unk> provisions that violate the recommendation clause in article ii of the constitution \r\n <unk> provisions which might be called <unk> laws as well prevent the executive branch from even looking at certain policy options let alone from recommending them to congress \r\n such laws violate the provision in article ii that requires the president to make recommendations to congress but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations \r\n typically these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from <unk> into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more <unk> alternatives to regulations \r\n probably the most <unk> example is a <unk> in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president 's office of management and budget from <unk> agricultural marketing orders to any <unk> scrutiny \r\n there is something <unk> suspect about congress 's <unk> the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other \r\n perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal N better illustrates congress 's attempt to <unk> executive power than section N of the <unk> bill none of the funds made available <unk> to the provisions of this act shall be used to implement <unk> or enforce any regulation which has been <unk> <unk> to a resolution of <unk> <unk> adopted in <unk> with the applicable law of the united states \r\n this provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president 's execution of the law since a <unk> resolution could be said to be <unk> adopted even though it would require neither <unk> action in congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto \r\n the supreme court 's decision in <unk> v. <unk> held that legislative <unk> are unconstitutional \r\n president bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to <unk> his duties and exercise his prerogatives \r\n if president bush fails to do so in his first year he will <unk> congress for the remainder of his presidency to rewrite article ii of the constitution to suit its purposes \r\n what becomes custom in the bush administration will only become more difficult for future presidents including democrats to undo \r\n president reagan learned that lesson \r\n by N <unk> jim wright was discussing arms control in moscow with mikhail gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president through an appropriations rider to treat the soviets as though the senate had ratified salt ii \r\n if a veto is <unk> because it would leave part of the executive branch <unk> the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and <unk> a power of <unk> declaring the rider restricting his article ii powers to be unconstitutional and <unk> \r\n the constitution does not <unk> give the president such power \r\n however the president does have a duty not to violate the constitution \r\n the question is whether his only means of defense is the veto \r\n <unk> of appropriations riders that trespass on the president 's duties and <unk> under article ii would be different from the line-item veto \r\n as discussed in the context of controlling federal spending the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to <unk> perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are <unk> merely because they conflict with his policy objectives \r\n the <unk> of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited <unk> \r\n one could argue that it is not an <unk> of a item veto at all for the president by <unk> a power of <unk> to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers \r\n there is no downside if the president asserts a right of <unk> over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal N appropriations bills \r\n if congress does nothing president bush will have won \r\n if congress takes the dispute to the supreme court assuming it can establish standing to sue president bush might win \r\n in that case he might receive an opinion from the court that is a <unk> of the president 's right to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives the <unk> thought should be <unk> to the executive \r\n if president bush loses at the court it might be disappointing as morrison v. <unk> was for the reagan administration \r\n but the presidency would be no worse off than it is now \r\n moreover the <unk> would have received a valuable <unk> lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice \r\n as it stands now congress <unk> after the reagan administration that the white house will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down \r\n president bush should set things straight \r\n if he does not he will help realize madison 's fear in the <unk> no. N of a legislature everywhere extending the <unk> of its activity and drawing all powers into its <unk> <unk> \r\n mr. <unk> served as an attorney in the reagan administration \r\n his longer analysis of executive power and the appropriations clause is to appear in the duke law journal later this year \r\n despite one of the most devastating <unk> on record net cash income in the farm belt rose to a new high of $ N billion last year \r\n the previous record was $ N billion in N according to the agriculture department \r\n net cash income the amount left in farmers ' pockets after <unk> expenses from gross cash income increased in N states in N as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices the department 's economic research service reported yesterday \r\n most of those states set farm income records \r\n the worst crop damage occurred in the midwestern corn belt and the northern great plains \r\n what saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity to reclaim large quantities of grain and other crops that they had <unk> to the government under <unk> loan programs \r\n with prices soaring they were able to sell the <unk> commodities at considerable profit the agency 's <unk> report said \r\n in less <unk> areas meanwhile farmers who had little or no loss of production <unk> greatly from the higher prices \r\n to the surprise of some analysts net cash income rose in some of the <unk> states including indiana illinois nebraska and the <unk> \r\n analysts attributed the increases partly to the $ N billion <unk> package enacted by congress \r\n last year 's record net cash income confirms the farm sector 's rebound from the agricultural depression of the early 1980s \r\n it also helps explain the reluctance of the major farm <unk> and many lawmakers to make any significant changes in the N farm program next year \r\n commodity prices have been rising in recent years with the farm price index hitting record <unk> earlier this year as the government curtailed production with <unk> programs to reduce <unk> surpluses \r\n at the same time export demand for u.s. wheat corn and other commodities strengthened said keith collins a department analyst \r\n farmers also benefited from strong livestock prices as the nation 's cattle inventory dropped close to a 30-year low \r\n all of these forces came together in N to benefit agriculture mr. collins said \r\n california led the nation with $ N billion in net cash income last year followed by texas $ N billion iowa $ N billion florida $ N billion and minnesota $ N billion \r\n iowa and minnesota were among the few major farm states to <unk> a decline in net cash income \r\n despite federal disaster relief the drought of N was a severe financial setback for an estimated N to N farmers according to the department \r\n many lost their farms \r\n department economists do n't expect N to be as good a year as N was \r\n indeed net cash income is likely to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline \r\n at the same time an increase of land under <unk> after the drought has boosted production of corn soybeans and other commodities causing a fall in prices that has been only partly <unk> by heavy grain buying by the soviets \r\n last year government payments to farmers slipped to less than $ N billion from a record $ N billion in N \r\n payments are expected to range between $ N billion and $ N billion this year \r\n after years of struggling the los angeles herald examiner will publish its last edition today shut down by its parent hearst corp. following unsuccessful efforts to sell the venerable newspaper \r\n the demise of the <unk> herald once the nation 's largest afternoon newspaper with circulation exceeding N turns the country 's second-largest city into a <unk> town at least in some <unk> \r\n the los angeles times with a circulation of more than N million dominates the region \r\n but it faces stiff competition in

the herald a <unk> paper in a freeway town was perhaps inevitable \r\n los angeles is a <unk> <unk> newspaper market and advertisers seemed to feel they could buy space in the <unk> times then target a particular area with one of the regional <unk> \r\n the herald was left in limbo \r\n further the herald seemed torn <unk> between keeping its <unk> hearst <unk> blue-collar and <unk> and trying to

marginally because of its place in family history \r\n its <unk> offices were designed by architect <unk> morgan who built the hearst castle at san <unk> \r\n william <unk> hearst had kept an

hearst hired editor james <unk> who <unk> the editorial product considerably \r\n he and his successor mary anne <unk> restored respect for the editorial product and though in recent years the paper

\r\n the herald 's sports coverage and arts criticism were also highly regarded \r\n robert j. <unk> vice president and general manager of hearst newspapers stood up in the paper 's <unk> yesterday

N and will end dec.

N kidder peabody & co. 's N stockbrokers across the country began a telephone and <unk> campaign aimed at <unk> the country 's second-largest program trader \r\n the target of their <unk> \r\n their own employer kidder peabody \r\n since october 's <unk> wall street has been shaken by an explosion of <unk> against program trading the computer-driven <unk> trades of huge baskets of stocks and futures that can send stock prices reeling in minutes \r\n but the <unk> fight over program trading is about much more than a volatile stock market \r\n the real battle is over who will control that market and reap its huge rewards \r\n program trading itself according to many <unk> who have studied it is merely caught in the middle of this battle unfairly labeled as the evil driving force of the marketplace \r\n the evidence indicates that program trading did n't in fact cause the market 's sharp fall on oct. N though it may have <unk> it \r\n on one side of this power struggle stand the forces in <unk> on wall street the new guard consisting of high-tech computer <unk> at the major brokerage firms their pension fund clients with <unk> pools of money and the traders at the fast-growing chicago futures exchanges \r\n these are the main proponents of program trading \r\n defending their <unk> are wall street 's old guard the traditional <unk> money managers tens of thousands of stock brokers the new york stock exchange 's listed companies and the <unk> floor traders known as specialists who make markets in their stocks \r\n so far wall street 's old guard seems to be winning the program-trading battle successfully <unk> public and congressional opinion to <unk> their <unk> \r\n the chicago mercantile exchange a major futures marketplace yesterday announced the addition of another layer of trading halts designed to slow program traders during a rapidly falling stock market and the big board is expected today to approve some additional restrictions on program trading \r\n <unk> by charges that their greed is turning the stock market into a <unk> <unk> almost all the big investment banking houses have abandoned index arbitrage a common form of program trading for their own accounts in the past few days \r\n a few such as giant merrill lynch & co. now refuse even to do index arbitrage trades for clients \r\n the old guard 's assault on program trading and its practitioners has been fierce and broad-based in part because some old guard members feel their very <unk> is at stake \r\n some such as traditional money manager neuberger & <unk> have taken out national newspaper advertisements demanding that market regulators stop the numbers <unk> on wall street \r\n big board stock specialists in a bold palace <unk> began shortly after oct. N to telephone the corporate executives of the companies whose stock is listed on the big board to have them pressure the exchange to ban program trading \r\n charles wohlstetter the chairman of contel corp. who is <unk> other <unk> to the <unk> trading cause says he has received <unk> letters offering support \r\n they said <unk> without a single exception do n't even compromise \r\n kill it he says \r\n wall street 's new guard is n't likely to take all this lying down for long however \r\n its new products and trading techniques have been highly profitable \r\n program trading money managers have gained control over a big chunk of the invested funds in this country and the pressures on such money managers to produce consistent profits has <unk> them to the ability to move rapidly in and out the market that program trading gives them \r\n what 's more the last time major wall street firms said they were getting out of program trading in the aftermath of the N crash they waited a few months and then <unk> back into it \r\n even some members of the old guard despite their current advantage seem to be <unk> that the future belongs with the new guard \r\n last week robert m. bradley one of the big board 's most respected floor traders and head of a major traders ' organization surrendered \r\n he sold his exchange seat and wrote a bitter letter to big board chairman john j. phelan jr. in which he said the big board is too focused on machines rather than people \r\n he said the exchange is headed for a real crisis if program trading is n't <unk> \r\n i do not want my money invested in what i consider as nothing more than a casino mr. bradley wrote \r\n the battle has turned into a civil war at some firms and organizations causing internal <unk> and <unk> employee against employee \r\n at kidder a unit of general electric co. and other big brokerage firms stockbrokers battle their own firm 's program traders a few floors away \r\n corporations like contel <unk> program trading yet contel has in the past hired pension fund managers like bankers trust co. that are also big program traders \r\n the big board the nation 's premier stock exchange is sharply divided between its floor traders and its top executives \r\n its entrenched N stock specialists firms are fighting <unk> and <unk> against programs \r\n but the big board 's leadership over the specialists ' protests two weeks ago began trading a new stock basket product designed to facilitate program trading \r\n a lot of people would like to go back to N before program trading mr. phelan said this week \r\n i would like to go back to N \r\n but we are not going back to N \r\n again and again program-trading 's critics raise the casino theme \r\n they say greedy market <unk> have made a <unk> of the nation 's <unk> system turning the stock market into a big gambling <unk> with the odds heavily <unk> against the small investor \r\n the public did n't come to the market to play a game they can go to <unk> betting for that says a. <unk> murray chairman of <unk> murray foster securities a traditional money management firm \r\n the program traders on the other hand <unk> old-fashioned stock pickers as the <unk> of the industry \r\n critics like mr. murray are looking for <unk> and people who use computers to trade are a convenient <unk> says j. thomas allen president of advanced investment management inc. a pittsburgh firm that runs a $ N million fund that uses index arbitrage \r\n just a blind fear of the unknown is causing them to <unk> the regulators for protection \r\n for all the furor there is nothing particularly complex about the concept of stock-index arbitrage the most controversial type of <unk> program trading \r\n like other forms of arbitrage it merely seeks to take advantage of <unk> discrepancies in the price of a single product in this case a basket of stocks in different markets in this case the new york stock exchange and the chicago futures markets \r\n that divergence is what stock index traders seek \r\n when it occurs the traders place orders via computers to buy the basket of stocks such as the N stocks that constitute the standard & poor 's N stock index in whichever market is cheaper and sell them in the more expensive market they lock in the difference in price as profit \r\n such program trades which can involve the purchase or sale of millions of dollars of stock occur in a matter of seconds \r\n a program trade of $ N million of stock typically earns a <unk> profit of $ N \r\n to keep program-trading units profitable in the eyes of senior brokerage executives traders must seize every opportunity their computers find \r\n the speed with which such program trades take place and the volatile price movements they can cause are what program trading critics <unk> to <unk> \r\n if you continue to do this the investor becomes frightened any investor the odd <unk> mutual funds and pension funds says larry <unk> managing partner at neuberger & <unk> \r\n but many experts and traders say that program trading is n't the main reason for stock-market gyrations \r\n i have not seen one <unk> of evidence to support restrictions on program trading says a <unk> university finance professor <unk> stoll an authority on the subject \r\n says the big board 's mr. phelan volatility is greater than program trading \r\n the oct. N plunge was triggered not by program traders but by news of the <unk> of the $ N billion buy-out of ual corp \r\n unable to unload ual and other airline shares takeover-stock speculators or risk arbitragers dumped every blue-chip stock they had \r\n while program trades swiftly kicked in a circuit breaker that halted trading in stock futures in chicago made some program trading impossible \r\n susan del <unk> head trader at travelers investment management co. says critics are ignoring the role the takeover stock <unk> is taking in the market as a source of volatility \r\n many <unk> are <unk> she says and they have to sell when things look like they fall apart \r\n like virtually everything on wall street the program-trading battle is over money and the <unk> have been losing out on <unk> of it to the new guard in recent years \r\n take the traditional money managers or stock pickers as they are <unk> known among the computer <unk> \r\n traditional stock managers like to charge N cents to N cents for every $ N they manage for big institutional investors and higher fees for smaller investors \r\n yet many such managers consistently fail to even keep up with much less beat the returns of standard <unk> like the s&p \r\n not surprisingly <unk> money managers have been losing clients to giant stock-index funds that use computers to <unk> portfolios so they mirror the s&p N \r\n the <unk> charge only a few pennies per $ N managed \r\n today about $ N billion or N N of all <unk> stock investments is held by index funds \r\n the new wall street of computers and automated trading threatens to make <unk> of the N big board <unk> firms \r\n these small but influential floor brokers long have earned fat returns of N N to N N a year on their capital by virtue of their monopoly in making markets in individual stocks \r\n the specialists see any step to electronic trading as a death <unk> \r\n and they believe the big board under mr. phelan has abandoned their interest \r\n the son of a specialist and once one himself mr. phelan has nonetheless been <unk> with products like the new stock basket that his former colleagues dislike so much to keep index funds and other program traders from taking their business to overseas markets \r\n meanwhile specialists ' trading risks have skyrocketed as a result of stock-market volatility \r\n when the sell programs hit you can hear the order printers start to go on the big board trading floor says one specialist there \r\n the buyers walk away and the specialist is left alone as the buyer of last resort for his stable of stocks he contends \r\n no one is more unhappy with program trading than the nation 's stockbrokers \r\n they are still trying to lure back small investors spooked by the N stock-market crash and the market 's swings since then \r\n small investors are absolutely <unk> that wall street is <unk> the deck against them and these wide swings are scaring them to death says raymond a. mason chairman of regional broker legg mason inc. in baltimore \r\n stockbrokers ' business and pay has been falling \r\n last year the average broker earned $ N N N lower than in N \r\n corporate executives <unk> that their company 's stock has been transformed into a <unk> piece of a stock-index basket \r\n index traders who buy all N stocks in the s&p N often do n't even know what the companies they own actually do complains andrew <unk> chairman of champion international corp \r\n do you make <unk> or <unk> \r\n oh you 're in the paper business is one reaction mr. <unk> says he 's gotten from his big institutional shareholders \r\n by this september program traders were doing a record N N of the big board 's average daily trading volume \r\n among the top practitioners were wall street blue <unk> morgan stanley & co. kidder peabody merrill lynch salomon brothers inc. and painewebber group inc \r\n but then came oct. N and the negative publicity <unk> by the old guard particularly against index arbitrage \r\n the <unk> ' strategy for the moment is to <unk> down and let the furor die \r\n there 's a <unk> psychology right now says the top program-trading official at a wall street firm \r\n wall street 's cash <unk> has been <unk> but i do n't think anyone has proven that index arbitrage is the problem \r\n too much money is at stake for program traders to give up \r\n for example stock-index futures began trading in chicago in N and within two years they were the fastest-growing futures contract ever launched \r\n stock futures trading has <unk> dozens of <unk> in their <unk> and <unk> \r\n now on a good day chicago 's stock-index traders trade more dollars worth of stock futures than the big board trades in stock \r\n now the stage is set for the battle to play out \r\n the <unk> are getting some helpful <unk> from congress \r\n program traders ' power to create total panic is so great that they ca n't be allowed to have their way says rep. edward markey a massachusetts democrat \r\n we have to have a system that says to those largest investors \r\n sit down \r\n you will not panic \r\n you will not put the financial system in jeopardy \r\n but the prospects for legislation that targets program trading is unlikely anytime soon \r\n many people including the big board think that it 's too late to put the <unk> back in the bottle \r\n the big board 's directors meet today to approve some program-trading restrictions but a total ban is n't being considered big board officials say \r\n you 're not going to stop the idea of trading a basket of stocks says <unk> 's prof. stoll \r\n program trading is here to stay and computers are here to stay and we just need to understand it \r\n short of a total ban some <unk> have proposed several <unk> reforms which they say would take away certain advantages program traders currently enjoy in the marketplace that other investors do n't \r\n one such proposal regarding stock-index futures is an increase in the margin requirement or the <unk> payment of cash needed to trade them to about the same level as the margin requirement for stocks \r\n currently margins on stock futures purchases are much lower roughly N N compared with N N for stocks making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative \r\n program trading critics also want the federal reserve board rather than the futures industry to set such margins \r\n futures traders respond that low margins help keep their markets active \r\n higher margins would chase away dozens of smaller traders who help larger traders buy and sell they say \r\n another proposed reform is to have program traders answer to an uptick rule a reform instituted after the great crash of N that protects against stocks being <unk> beaten downward by those seeking to profit from lower prices namely short sellers \r\n the big board 's uptick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price \r\n but in N program traders received what amounted to an exemption from the uptick rule in certain situations to make it easier to link the stock and futures markets \r\n a <unk> of the uptick rule for program traders would slow their activity considerably \r\n program traders argue that a <unk> of the rule would destroy the pricing efficiency of the futures and stock markets \r\n james a. white contributed to this article \r\n <unk> <unk> \r\n big board chairman john phelan said yesterday that he could support letting federal regulators suspend program trading during wild <unk> swings \r\n thus the <unk> psychology of recent days picks up new impetus \r\n index arbitrage is a common form of program trading \r\n as usually practiced it takes advantage of a rather basic concept two separate markets in different locations trading basically the same <unk> ca n't trade them for long at prices that are widely different \r\n in index arbitrage the widget is the s&p N and its price is constantly compared between the futures market in chicago and the stock markets largely in new york \r\n to profit from an index-arbitrage opportunity someone who owns the s&p N widget in new york must sell it and replace it with a cheaper s&p N widget in chicago \r\n if the money manager performing this service is being paid by his clients to match or beat the return of the s&p N index he is likely to remain fully invested at all times \r\n few if any <unk> managers will risk <unk> performance by owning more than N N exposure to stocks and equally few will want to own less than a N N position should stocks rise \r\n by constantly seeking to own the cheapest widget index-arbitrage traders hope to add between N N and N N to the annual return of the s&p N \r\n that represents a very thin excess return certainly far less than what most fundamental stock pickers claim to seek as their performance objective \r\n the fact that a vast majority of <unk> money managers fail to beat the s&p N may contribute to the <unk> surrounding the issue \r\n as more managers pursue the index-arbitrage strategy these small opportunities between markets will be reduced and eventually eliminated \r\n the current opportunities arise because the process for executing a buy or sell order in the actual stocks that make up the s&p N is more <unk> than <unk> in the futures market \r\n the new york stock exchange 's attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors ' <unk> to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares \r\n so if index arbitrage is simply taking advantage of thin <unk> between two markets for the same widget how did program trading <unk> into the evil <unk> that is <unk> the <unk> of so many observers \r\n all arguments against program trading even those pressed without fact conclude with three expected results after reforms are implemented N reduced volatility N a long-term investment focus and N a level playing field for the small investor \r\n but many of these reforms are <unk> even harmful \r\n reducing volatility \r\n an index-arbitrage trade is never executed unless there is sufficient difference between the markets in new york and chicago to cover all transaction costs \r\n arbitrage does n't cause volatility it <unk> to it \r\n think about what causes the difference in prices between the two markets for s&p N stocks usually it is large investors <unk> a buy or sell in chicago \r\n a large investor will likely cause the futures market to decline when he sells his futures \r\n arbitrage simply transfers his selling pressure from chicago to new york while <unk> as a buyer in chicago \r\n the start of the whole process is the key someone must fundamentally increase or decrease his ownership in <unk> to make widget prices move \r\n why does this large hypothetical seller trade in chicago instead of new york \r\n perhaps he is willing to sacrifice to the arbitrage trader some small profit in order to get quick and certain execution of his large trade \r\n in a competitive market this investor has many ways to execute his transactions and he will have more alternatives both foreign and domestic if his volume is profitable for an exchange to handle \r\n if not chicago then in new york if not the u.s. then overseas \r\n volatility surrounding his trades occurs not because of index arbitrage but because his is a large addition or <unk> to a widget market with <unk> liquidity \r\n eliminate arbitrage and liquidity will decline instead of rising creating more volatility instead of less \r\n the speed of his transaction is n't to be feared either because faster and cleaner execution is desirable not <unk> \r\n if slowing things down could reduce volatility stone <unk> should become the trade ticket of the future \r\n encouraging long-term investing \r\n we must be very cautious about <unk> investors as long-term or short-term \r\n policies designed to encourage one type of investor over another are <unk> to placing a sign over the big board 's door saying buyers welcome sellers please go away \r\n the ultimate goal of any investor is a profit motive and regulators should not concern themselves with whether investors are sufficiently focused on the long term \r\n a free market with a profit motive will attract each investor to the liquidity and risks he can <unk> \r\n in point of fact volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today \r\n periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile usually when fundamental market conditions were <unk> change N N and N for example \r\n it is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers <unk> <unk> on program trading when the markets decline while <unk> the great values still <unk> as the markets rise \r\n could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks instead of the evil <unk> of program-trading <unk> \r\n some of the proposed <unk> for what is labeled program-trading volatility could be far worse than the perceived problem \r\n in using program trading as a <unk> boy <unk> investors stand to gain the high ground in wooing small investors for their existing <unk> products \r\n they may however risk bringing some damaging <unk> from outside the markets themselves \r\n how does a nice new tax say N N on any financial transaction sound \r\n that ought to make sure we 're all thinking for the long term \r\n getting a level playing field \r\n this argument is perhaps the most interesting one for <unk> program trading not because of its merits but because of the firms <unk> the cause \r\n the <unk> of these reformers are money managers who cater to smaller investors \r\n they continually advise their clients on which individual stocks to buy or sell while their clients continue to hope for superior performance \r\n even with mutual funds the little investor continues to <unk> high fees high commissions and poor performance while <unk> managers slowly <unk> a better record with lower fees lower commissions and less risk \r\n yet our efforts are somehow less noble than those of an investment expert <unk> <unk> press <unk> on each company he follows \r\n almost all new regulation is introduced in the interests of protecting the little guy and he invariably is the one least able to cope with its consequences \r\n if spreads available from index arbitrage are so enormous surely any sizable mutual-fund company could profit from offering it to small investors \r\n the sad reality is that the retail investor continues to pursue <unk> performers first while leaving institutions to <unk> with basis points of performance on large sums of money quarter by quarter \r\n <unk> index funds just are n't <unk> enough to justify the high fees and commissions that retail customers frequently pay and that institutional customers refuse to pay \r\n each new trading <unk> is likely to be beaten by institutions seeking better ways to serve their <unk> clients here or overseas \r\n <unk> new trading <unk> will only make things harder on the least sophisticated investors \r\n so what is next for program trading \r\n left to its own devices index arbitrage will become more and more efficient making it harder and harder to do profitably \r\n spreads will become so tight that it wo n't matter which market an investor chooses arbitrage will prevent him from gaining any temporary profit \r\n if government or private <unk> insist however on introducing greater <unk> between the markets limits on price moves <unk> execution higher margin requirements taxation etc. the end loser will be the markets themselves \r\n instead we ought to be inviting more liquidity with cheaper ways to trade and transfer capital among all participants \r\n mr. allen 's pittsburgh firm advanced investment management inc. <unk> program trades for institutions \r\n some democrats in congress are warning that a complicated new funding device for the two federal antitrust agencies could result in further cutbacks in a regulatory area already reduced sharply in recent years \r\n the funding mechanism which has received congressional approval and is expected to be signed by president bush would affect the antitrust operations of the justice department and the federal trade commission \r\n as a part of overall efforts to reduce spending congress cut by $ N million the bush administration 's request for antitrust enforcement for fiscal N which began oct. N \r\n to offset the reduction congress approved a $ N fee that investors and companies will have to pay each time they make required filings to antitrust regulators about mergers acquisitions and certain other transactions \r\n some democrats led by rep. jack brooks d. texas unsuccessfully opposed the measure because they fear that the fees may not fully make up for the budget cuts \r\n but justice department and ftc officials said they expect the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them \r\n it could operate to <unk> our budget james <unk> the justice department 's antitrust chief said in an interview \r\n under measures approved by both houses of congress the administration 's request for $ N million for the antitrust division would be cut $ N million \r\n the ftc budget request of $ N million about $ N million of which would go for antitrust enforcement would also be cut by $ N million \r\n the administration had requested roughly the same amount for antitrust enforcement for fiscal N as was appropriated in fiscal N \r\n the offsetting fees would apply to filings made under the hart-scott-rodino act \r\n under that law parties proposing mergers or acquisitions valued at $ N million or more must notify ftc and justice department antitrust regulators before completing the transactions \r\n currently the government charges nothing for such filings \r\n proponents of the funding arrangement predict that based on recent filing levels of more than N a year the fees will yield at least $ N million this fiscal year or $ N million more than the budget cuts \r\n when you do that there is not a cut but there is in fact a program increase of $ N million each for the ftc and the justice department rep. neal smith d. iowa said during house debate \r\n but rep. don edwards d. calif responded that a recession could <unk> merger activity reducing the amount of fees collected \r\n the antitrust staffs of both the ftc and justice department were cut more than N N in the reagan administration and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period \r\n today is not the time to signal that congress in any way sanctions the dismal state into which antitrust enforcement has fallen mr. edwards argued \r\n any money in excess of $ N million collected from the fees in fiscal N would go to the treasury at large \r\n corporate lawyers said the new fees would n't inhibit many mergers or other transactions \r\n though some lawyers reported that prospective <unk> were scrambling to make filings before the fees take effect government officials said they had n't noticed any surge in filings \r\n fall ballot issues set a record for <unk> elections \r\n <unk> elections attract relatively few ballot issues

the reason risks from the firms ' new merchant banking activities are rising as revenue from the industry 's traditional business <unk> \r\n the downgrading of debt issued by cs first boston inc. parent of first boston corp. by moody 's investors service inc. coupled with a moody 's announcement that shearson lehman hutton holdings inc. is under review for a possible downgrade sent <unk> through the brokerage community this week \r\n with the <unk> came the <unk> that some of wall street 's biggest players are struggling to maintain the <unk> credit standing required to finance their activities profitably \r\n securities firms are among the biggest issuers of commercial paper or short-term corporate <unk> which they sell to finance their daily operations \r\n the biggest firms still retain the highest ratings on their commercial paper \r\n but moody 's warned that shearson 's commercial paper rating could be lowered soon a move that would reduce shearson 's profit margins on its borrowings and signal trouble ahead for other firms \r\n shearson is <unk> by american express co \r\n just as the 1980s bull market transformed the u.s. securities business so too will the more difficult environment of the 1990s says christopher t. <unk> a moody 's vice president \r\n a sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible \r\n standard & poor 's corp. says first boston shearson and drexel burnham lambert inc. in particular are likely to have difficulty <unk> up their credit standing in months ahead \r\n what worries <unk> concerns the most is that wall street firms are taking long-term risks with their own capital via leveraged buy-out and junk bond financings \r\n that 's a departure from their traditional practice of <unk> almost all financing risks to investors \r\n <unk> conventional securities financings are structured to be sold quickly wall street 's new <unk> for leveraged buy-outs and junk bonds is resulting in long-term lending commitments that stretch out for months or years \r\n the recent disarray in the junk bond market suggests that brokers may become longer-term creditors than they anticipated and may face long delays in getting their money back says jeffrey <unk> a vice president at s&p which raised a warning flag for the industry in april when it downgraded cs first boston \r\n wall street is facing a <unk> situation says mr. <unk> of moody 's \r\n merchant banking where firms commit their own money is getting riskier and there 's less of it to go around \r\n in addition he says the buy-out business is under pressure because of the junk bond collapse meaning that returns are likely to decline as the volume of junk-bond financings <unk> \r\n in a leveraged buy-out a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing with the expectation that the debt will be paid with funds generated by the acquired company 's operations or sales of its assets \r\n in a recent report moody 's said it expects intense competition to occur through the rest of the century in the securities industry which combined with overcapacity will create poor prospects for profitability \r\n it said that the temptation for <unk> to ease this profit pressure by taking greater risks is an additional rating factor \r\n both moody 's and s&p cited first boston 's reliance in recent years on merchant banking which has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held firm 's profit \r\n the recent cash squeeze at campeau corp. first boston 's most lucrative client of the decade is proving costly to first boston because it arranged more than $ N billion of high-yield high-risk junk financings for campeau units \r\n in addition a big loan that first boston made to ohio <unk> co was n't repaid on time when its $ N million junk financing for a buy-out of the <unk> company was withdrawn \r\n these two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of cs first boston 's equity moody 's said \r\n total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm 's equity \r\n cs first boston however benefits from the backing of its largest shareholder credit suisse switzerland 's third largest bank \r\n shearson also has been an aggressive participant in the leveraged buy-out business \r\n but its earnings became a major disappointment as its traditional retail or individual investor business showed no signs of rebounding from the slump that followed the october N stock market crash \r\n in addition shearson 's listed $ N billion of capital is <unk> according to the rating concerns because it includes $ N billion of goodwill \r\n shearson really only has $ N million of capital says mr. <unk> of s&p \r\n a shearson spokesman said the firm is n't worried \r\n a year ago moody 's also had shearson under review for possible downgrade he said \r\n after two months of talks our rating was maintained \r\n drexel meanwhile already competes at a disadvantage to its big wall street rivals because it has a slightly lower commercial paper rating \r\n the collapse of junk bond prices and the cancellation of many junk bond financings apparently have taken their toll on closely held drexel the leading underwriter in that market \r\n the firm also has been hit with big financial settlements with the government stemming from its guilty plea to six <unk> related to a big insider-trading scandal \r\n drexel this year eliminated its retail or individual customer business cutting the firm 's <unk> almost in half to just over N \r\n recently drexel circulated a private financial statement among several securities firms showing that its earnings performance has diminished this year from previous years \r\n the firm 's capital moreover has n't grown at the same rate as in the past officials at these firms say \r\n drexel remains confident of its future <unk> \r\n we 're well positioned with $ N billion of capital a drexel spokesman said \r\n and as a leading investment and merchant banking firm the fact that we are no longer subject to the uncertainties and <unk> of the retail business is a major plus in our view \r\n moreover we 've probably been the most aggressive firm on the street in reducing costs which are down around N N over the last six months \r\n lewis c. <unk> the father of the team that created the highly successful ford <unk> and mercury <unk> cars retired early after experiencing recent heart problems \r\n most recently mr. <unk> N years old has been vice president of product and manufacturing engineering at ford motor co \r\n but he is best known in the auto industry as the <unk> of a team <unk> approach that produced the two midsized cars that were instrumental in helping the no. N auto maker record profits in recent years and in enabling the company 's ford division to <unk> general motors corp. 's chevrolet division as the <unk> <unk> in the u.s. \r\n under the so-called team <unk> approach mr. <unk> and other ford product planners sought the involvement of parts suppliers <unk> workers auto designers and financial staff members from the initial stages of the development cycle \r\n the concept 's goal was to eliminate bureaucracy and make ford 's product development more responsive to consumer demands \r\n it was later applied to other <unk> programs including those that produced the ford <unk> and mercury <unk> \r\n ford chairman donald e. <unk> said yesterday that mr. <unk> has helped to change the world 's perception of <unk> cars \r\n mr. <unk> worked at ford for N years holding a variety of car and <unk> positions \r\n the limits to legal <unk> stretched another <unk> this week when the supreme court refused to hear an appeal from a case that says corporate defendants must pay damages even after proving that they could not possibly have caused the harm \r\n we can understand and share the <unk> that makes judges sometimes wish to offer a kind of <unk> aid to those who 've been hurt \r\n but this case is a stark lesson in how the failures of the traditional <unk> process have left the courts as the only forum this country has to debate risk technology and innovation \r\n too often now a single court decision becomes the precedent for other less compelling cases \r\n from the <unk> until N some two million women took the synthetic <unk> <unk> des to prevent <unk> and morning <unk> \r\n the drug was approved by the food and drug administration and marketed by some N pharmaceutical companies often under generic labels \r\n in the 1970s scientists reported cancer cases among the daughters of des users \r\n the cases quickly went to court but the mothers of several thousand des plaintiffs could n't recall whose brand they used \r\n beginning in N courts in several states including california and new york decided to suspend the <unk> rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who are liable \r\n courts made the assumption that all des pills were essentially the same and created a market-share test so that damages would be assessed against drug makers in the proportion of their share of the original sales \r\n this has some logic \r\n drug makers should n't be able to duck liability because people could n't identify precisely which identical drug was used \r\n but courts quickly tumbled down a <unk> <unk> \r\n just as all plaintiffs are not alike it turns out that des defendants marketed the drugs differently and may have offered different <unk> \r\n the ultimate result came in <unk> v. lilly where the highest new york court expanded the market-share approach for the first time to say that drug makers that could prove <unk> <unk> 's mother did n't use their pill must still pay their share of any damages \r\n but as duke university law professor william van <unk> notes by this <unk> a defendant could be held liable in new york for a bad apple even if he sold all his apples in california \r\n despite the supreme court 's refusal to hear the case there are serious constitutional issues of due process and <unk> <unk> from the defendants \r\n the big problem however is that there 's no guarantee that this <unk> will be limited to des or to drugs \r\n the problem here goes well beyond <unk> legal doctrine \r\n the california supreme court last year reversed direction to make it much harder to win des cases because the justices saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has <unk> the introduction of new drugs \r\n the court rejected strict liability for prescription drugs citing the huge hidden social costs \r\n public policy favors the development and marketing of beneficial new drugs even though some risks perhaps serious ones might <unk> their introduction because drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering the <unk> court said \r\n the california justices noted that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining <unk> drug <unk> off the u.s. market \r\n this raises the key issue what to do about people who suffer serious injuries from beneficial drugs \r\n we now know that holding drug makers liable where there 's no evidence that they or anyone else knew of any risks only means the drugs wo n't be available to anyone \r\n as liability expert peter <unk> tells us after the <unk> case if any drug maker <unk> an <unk> drug it 's time to sell that company 's stock short \r\n we also know that the <unk> system is a <unk> way to compensate victims anyway some win the legal <unk> others get much less and <unk> lawyers take a big cut either way \r\n des daughters and other victims of drugs would be better off if their cases were taken out of the courts \r\n congress could create a compensation program to help such victims while protecting the national interest in encouraging new drugs \r\n but a N law that supposedly replaced lawsuits over children 's <unk> with a compensation fund has predictably led to even more litigation \r\n everyone by now understands that congress is utterly <unk> of writing legislation to help <unk> people without its becoming some billion-dollar <unk> \r\n we have no doubt this is one reason judges in new york and justices on the supreme court are willing to trash the law in the des

delivery rose its daily permissible limit of N cent a pound to N cents while other contract months showed <unk> advances \r\n according to reports carried by various news services the brazilian government told its sugar producers that they wo n't be allowed to export sugar during the current N season which began may N and the N season so that it can be used to produce alcohol for automobile fuel \r\n one analyst arthur stevenson of prudential-bache securities new york estimated that N N or more of brazil 's newly made automobiles run on alcohol and ca n't use gasoline \r\n this is a demand that must be met regardless of the price of oil said mr. stevenson \r\n brazil is the third-largest producer and the <unk> exporter of sugar in the world \r\n a shift to producing more alcohol and less sugar had been expected but the latest news if true indicates a more drastic shift than had been anticipated \r\n during the current crop year brazil was expected to produce N million tons of sugar a drop from N million tons in N \r\n its N exports were expected to total N tons in contrast to shipments of N million tons in \r\n it is these N tons that are in question for this crop year explained <unk> <unk> analyst for shearson lehman hutton new york \r\n producers were granted the right earlier this year to ship sugar and the export licenses were expected to have begun to be issued yesterday \r\n as a result ms. <unk> said it is believed that little or no sugar from the N crop has been shipped yet even though the crop year is six months old \r\n more than a half of all sugar produced in brazil goes for alcohol production according to ms. <unk> \r\n also there has been a switch in the past decade to <unk> of orange trees in areas that were previously used for cane and this change is being felt now she said \r\n most important ms. <unk> noted brazilian officials said that no decision has as yet been made on the suspension of exports \r\n thomas <unk> sugar analyst for painewebber in <unk> n.j. said i am highly skeptical that brazil will curtail sugar exports particularly with the price of sugar at over N cents a pound \r\n above all mr. <unk> noted the situation is extremely confused \r\n professional sugar people here who have strong contacts with the brazilian sugar industry have been unable to confirm the reports or get enough information to clarify the situation he said \r\n it 's the type of nervous atmosphere in which a report can be put out such as the one saying exports will be suspended and no one can confirm it \r\n mr. <unk> observed that the situation in brazil is also very complicated \r\n on the one hand brazil started an <unk> program about N years ago to fuel a huge portion of its national fleet of cars and is now committed to this program \r\n it has to weigh on the other hand the relatively high price of sugar it can earn on the export market in making decisions as to whether to produce sugar or alcohol mr. <unk> said \r\n mexico which is normally a sugar exporter has had production problems in the past two years analysts said \r\n last year it had to buy sugar on the world market to meet export commitments they noted \r\n this year it is expected to be a net importer and is said to be seeking to buy about N tons of sugar to meet internal needs analysts said \r\n in other commodity markets yesterday \r\n energy

\r\n gasoline futures were mixed to unchanged \r\n but the strength in heating oil helped push up crude oil \r\n west texas intermediate crude for december delivery rose N cents a barrel to settle at

the u.s. market analysts said that late tuesday the chinese government which often buys u.s. grains in quantity turned instead to britain to buy N metric tons of wheat \r\n traders said prices also were supported by widespread rumors that the soviet union is on the verge of receiving most favored nation status from the u.s. \r\n that <unk> would among other things provide more generous credit

in recent days columbia has edged up closing at N N up N yesterday on revived speculation that the thrift might restructure \r\n mr. spiegel 's fans say columbia 's southern california branches are

junk <unk> would reduce the cushion \r\n columbia has only about N million common shares in public hands \r\n the spiegel family has N N of the common and N N of the votes \r\n other big common

distinct junk-bond entity \r\n plans to do this are due to be filed in a week or so \r\n new rules force thrifts to write down their junk to market value then sell the bonds over five years \r\n that 's why columbia just wrote off $ N million of its junk and reserved $ N million for future junk losses \r\n but if columbia could keep its junk bonds separate from the thrift till they mature at full value unless the issuer goes <unk> or <unk> the junk portfolio might do all right \r\n columbia a longtime drexel client wo n't provide current data on its junk \r\n but its N big junk holdings at year end showed only a few bonds that have been really battered \r\n these were allied stores western union telegraph gillett holdings sci television and texas air though many other bonds in columbia

ultimate gains of as much as $ N million on equity investments in buy-outs and restructurings \r\n one trial balloon mr. spiegel is said to have <unk> to investors columbia might be broken up as mellon bank was split into a good bank and a bad bank \r\n but columbia 's good bank would be a regulated thrift while the bad bank would be a private investment company holding some of columbia 's junk bonds real estate and equity investments \r\n some think columbia 's thrift which now is seeking a new chief operating officer might be capitalized at say $ N million and <unk> to a commercial bank that wants a california presence \r\n the thrift surely could be sold for more than the value of its equity financial industry executives say \r\n meanwhile the bad bank with the junk bonds and some capital might be spun off to columbia shareholders including mr. spiegel who might then have a new career investors say \r\n it is n't clear how much a restructuring would help columbia stockholders \r\n but the concept is <unk> \r\n you sell the good bank as an ongoing operation and use some of the proceeds to capitalize the bad bank says thrift specialist lewis <unk> of <unk>

cincinnati and a reduction in staff throughout the company \r\n the battery plant which makes <unk> nickel <unk> and carbon <unk> products will be closed over the next year or so a spokesman said \r\n ralston attributed its fourth-quarter slump partly to higher costs of <unk> in the pet food business as well as competitive pressures which required higher advertising spending \r\n for the year pet

<unk> in the u.s. grain pipeline \r\n the soviet purchases are so massive that exporters are struggling to find enough river <unk> and trains to move the recently <unk> midwest crop to ports for <unk> onto soviet ships \r\n river <unk> rates have soared N N this fall from a year earlier \r\n railroad companies and some ports are <unk> a sudden <unk> of business \r\n and some grain analysts are predicting that corn prices might <unk> this month as exporters <unk> to find enough of the crop to meet their obligations to the soviets \r\n the soviet union bought roughly N million <unk> of u.s. corn in october which is the most ever sold to the soviet union in one month from the u.s. \r\n the soviet union wants much of it delivered by january which would be a strain in most years \r\n but it is particularly difficult this autumn because of low water levels on the mississippi river on which flows much of the u.s. corn that is shipped overseas \r\n we are shipping the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record said william <unk> a u.s. agriculture department transportation expert \r\n it is going to be real tight \r\n because of persistent dry weather in the northern plains the water level on the upper section of the mississippi river is so low that many river operators are already trimming the number of <unk> their <unk> push at one time \r\n in a few weeks many <unk> probably wo n't be able to operate fully loaded south of st. louis because the u.s. army corps of engineers is beginning to reduce the flow of the missouri river which feeds into the mississippi river \r\n the army corps is cutting the flow of the missouri river about two weeks earlier than normal because of low water levels in the <unk> that feed it \r\n <unk> rates on the mississippi river sank yesterday on speculation that widespread rain this week in the midwest might temporarily alleviate the situation \r\n but the army corps of engineers expects the river level to continue falling this month \r\n at st. louis the water level of the mississippi river is already N feet below normal and it could drop an additional N feet when the flow of the missouri river is slowed an army corps spokesman said \r\n similar levels <unk> <unk> shipments last year in the wake of the worst drought in N years \r\n so far the grain industry 's <unk> <unk> problems have n't been a major factor in the trading of corn contracts at the chicago board of trade \r\n many grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn futures contracts traded there to calculate the price they offer to buy corn from farmers \r\n at the board of trade yesterday the price of the corn contract for december delivery slipped N cents a bushel to settle at $ N a bushel \r\n corn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge soviet orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the <unk> <unk> by the N drought \r\n with the harvest <unk> down however some analysts are <unk> that prices might jump in some regions as u.s. exporters try to gather the corn they are obligated to deliver \r\n farmers are in the best position of many years to push up corn prices \r\n because the drought reduced u.s. <unk> they have more than enough storage space for their new crop and that permits them to wait for prices to rise \r\n in parts of iowa for example some grain elevators are offering farmers $ N a bushel for corn \r\n many farmers probably would n't sell until prices rose at least N cents a bushel said <unk> reed president of chicago central & pacific railroad co. of <unk> iowa \r\n it is n't clear however who would win a waiting game \r\n although u.s. corn <unk> shrank by roughly half in the wake of the drought the agriculture department projects that nearly <unk> of the harvest will still be in storage before the N corn harvest begins \r\n some analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry 's problems might spark investors to begin buying corn futures contracts only to see little appreciation \r\n the public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain to be shipped said bill <unk> <unk> inc. research director \r\n although much of this country 's export corn goes to new orleans by <unk> it is possible for exporters to <unk> the mississippi river by shipping a <unk> amount of corn by train to the port \r\n ports in the great <unk> and atlantic coast can also relieve pressure on new orleans \r\n one railroad for example is already increasing its grain <unk> service from indiana to baltimore \r\n and it is n't clear that the soviet union will stay on its record buying pace \r\n the soviet orders were <unk> into the month of october because of delays \r\n the soviet union usually begins buying u.s. crops earlier in the fall \r\n but its purchases apparently were delayed by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems \r\n in other commodity markets yesterday \r\n energy crude oil futures prices increased in moderate trading but much of the action was in heating oil \r\n prices rose on the news that a sizable west german refinery was damaged in a fire tightening an already tight european market \r\n heating oil for november delivery ended at N cents a <unk> up one cent on the new york mercantile exchange \r\n west texas intermediate for december

securities markets \r\n december delivery gold fell $ N an ounce to $ N \r\n december silver declined N cents an ounce to $ N \r\n january platinum was down $ N an ounce at $ N \r\n precious metals gold in particular currently are being influenced more by stock market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability according to william <unk> vice president of research at elders futures in new york \r\n the recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities he said \r\n yesterday the stock market rose strongly creating a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders he said \r\n silver and platinum which have more of an industrial nature than gold were even weaker he said \r\n silver is also under pressure of extremely high inventories in warehouses of the commodity exchange he said \r\n yesterday these stocks rose by N ounces to a record of N ounces according to an exchange spokesman \r\n copper futures prices partially recovered monday 's declines because <unk> miners voted to strike \r\n the december contract rose N cents a pound to $ N \r\n in chile workers at two copper mines los <unk> and el <unk> which belong to the <unk> <unk> <unk> yesterday voted to begin a full strike tomorrow an analyst said \r\n reasons for the <unk> the analyst said included a number of procedural issues such as a right to strike \r\n the analyst noted that also inherent in all metal markets was a sympathetic reaction to stocks \r\n in the case of copper he said the upbeat mood of stocks was reflected in demand for futures contracts because a stronger economy means greater buying interest for the metal \r\n also contributing to the <unk> in copper the analyst noted was a report by chicago purchasing agents which <unk> the full purchasing agents ' report that is due out today and gives an indication of what the full report might hold \r\n the purchasing management association of chicago 's october index rose to N N after three previous months of <unk> below N N \r\n the september index was N N \r\n a reading below N N generally indicates a slowing in the industrial sector of the economy while a reading above N N points to expansion \r\n the chicago report raised the possibility that the october survey of the national association of purchasing management would also show a reading above N N \r\n ncr corp. unveiled two models of its tower line of <unk> computers and introduced advanced <unk> software to allow the tower family to operate as a central hub in a network of computers \r\n the

nation 's largest steelmaker earned $ N million or N cents a share compared with the year-earlier $ N million or N cents a share \r\n the recent quarter includes pretax gains of $ N million from asset sales while like gains in the year-earlier quarter totaled $ N million \r\n in the N period usx also had a $ N million after-tax gain from a tax dispute settlement \r\n sales rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion \r\n the earnings drop appears particularly steep in comparison with last year 's unusually strong third quarter when the company was riding an industrywide boom in demand and pricing \r\n however third-quarter operating profit fell N N as usx sold sizable chunks of its diversified and steel segments eliminating income from those operations \r\n among segments that continue to operate though the company 's steel division continued to suffer from soft demand for its <unk> goods serving the oil industry and other markets \r\n peter marcus an analyst with painewebber inc. said that a downturn in the <unk> industry coupled with sluggish automotive sales hurt usx results \r\n moreover usx exports more than other steelmakers and the overseas market has been under more severe pricing pressure \r\n the company attributed lower sales and earnings for the steel segment to the loss of results from the <unk> ohio plant which now is a N joint venture with japan 's kobe steel ltd \r\n in the steel division operating profit dropped N N to $ N million \r\n profit per ton of steel shipped dropped to about $ N a ton from $ N a ton last year and $ N a ton in the second quarter analysts said \r\n still usx fared better than other major steelmakers earning more per ton of steel shipped than either bethlehem steel corp. which posted a N N drop in net income or inland steel industries inc. whose profit plummeted N N \r\n in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday usx shares closed up $ N at $ N as the reported earnings exceeded projections by some analysts who had n't expected as great a volume of asset sales \r\n the rise in the stock 's price may also reflect the fact that usx 's steel segment fared better than some other steelmakers ' \r\n charles bradford an analyst with merrill lynch capital markets said usx may have received orders lost by competitors who were involved in labor contracts earlier this year \r\n he said usx also appeared to sell a richer mix of steel products such as the more profitable pipe and galvanized coated sheet than <unk> structural goods \r\n the energy segment with a N N rise in operating profit is clearly the company 's strongest \r\n higher crude oil prices helped boost operating profit for the marathon oil co. unit to $ N million from $ N million \r\n the texas oil & gas division continues to operate in the red although losses narrowed to $ N million from $ N million \r\n usx announced in october that it was soliciting bids to sell <unk> 's oil and gas reserves \r\n proceeds of that sale are to be used to reduce debt and buy back shares \r\n the company noted that it has reduced debt by $ N billion since the end of N and bought back about N million shares of common stock since the fourth quarter of N \r\n usx has about $ N billion in long-term debt and N million shares outstanding \r\n the announced sale of the reserves was followed by news that investor carl icahn had increased his stake in usx to N N and threatened a takeover or other business combination \r\n mr. icahn has said he believes usx would be worth more if broken up into steel and energy segments \r\n profit for the nine months jumped N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share \r\n sales rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion \r\n john f. barrett N formerly executive vice president and

and laurence tribe of harvard law school said any effort by president bush to claim authority for a line-item veto would <unk> the text of the constitution and the intent of its authors as well as the views of previous presidents \r\n a line-item veto is a procedure that would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire measure \r\n mr. bush has said he would like to be able to use this procedure \r\n a white house spokesman said last week that the president is considering declaring that the constitution <unk> gives him the authority for a line-item veto to <unk> a test case \r\n but the two legal experts responding to an inquiry by sen. edward kennedy d. mass. wrote in a joint letter that the president lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto \r\n the two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum mr. <unk> is a conservative and mr. tribe is a liberal \r\n the two professors said the constitution <unk> the president to veto entire bills not partial measures \r\n moreover they said the first appropriations bill passed N years ago covered many different items and there was no discussion of a line-item veto \r\n they also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto authority since the civil war and all have shared the view that such <unk> power is beyond the reach of the president \r\n sen. kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation to give the president line-item veto power but that it would be a reckless course of

N \r\n apparently the commission did not really believe in this ideal \r\n currently the rules force executives directors and other corporate insiders to report purchases and sales of their companies ' shares within about a month after the transaction \r\n but about N N of the insiders according to sec figures file their reports late \r\n the changes were proposed in an effort to streamline federal bureaucracy and boost compliance by the executives who are really calling the shots said brian lane special counsel at the sec 's office of disclosure policy which proposed the changes \r\n investors money managers and corporate officials had until today to comment on the proposals and the issue has produced more mail than almost any other issue in memory mr. lane said \r\n the sec will probably vote on the proposal early next year he said \r\n not all those who wrote oppose the changes \r\n the committee on federal regulation of securities for the american bar association argues for example in its lengthy letter to the sec that the proposed changes would substantially improve the law by <unk> it more closely to contemporary business realities \r\n what the investors who oppose the proposed changes object to most is the effect they say the proposal would have on their ability to spot <unk> <unk> of trading activity buying or selling by more than one officer or director within a short period of time \r\n according to some estimates the rule changes would cut insider filings by more than a third \r\n the sec 's mr. lane <unk> disputed those estimates \r\n the rules will eliminate filings <unk> divisions such as sales marketing finance and research and development mr. lane said \r\n the proposed rules also would be tougher on the insiders still required to file reports he said \r\n companies would be <unk> to publish in annual proxy statements the names of insiders who fail to file reports on time \r\n considered as a whole mr. lane said the filings required under the proposed rules will be at least as effective if not more so for investors following transactions \r\n but robert <unk> president of <unk> a north miami fla. company that packages and sells the insider-trading data said the proposal is <unk> so <unk> that key officials may fail to file the reports \r\n many investors wrote asking the sec to require insiders to report their purchases and sales immediately not a month later \r\n but mr. lane said that while the sec <unk> who files the law tells them when to do so \r\n investors who want to change the required timing should write their representatives in congress he added \r\n the sec would likely be <unk> to legislation that required insiders to file transactions on a more timely basis he said \r\n the nation 's largest pension

line about the problem he commissions and <unk> <unk> <unk> contemporary scores and does some conducting so he does n't have to play the same <unk> and <unk> <unk> over and over again \r\n richard stoltzman has taken a <unk> more <unk> approach \r\n years ago he <unk> with the new music <unk> peter <unk> and fred <unk> in the very <unk> chamber group <unk> which won audiences over to <unk> contemporary scores like <unk> 's <unk> for the end of time \r\n today the <unk> <unk> has mostly dropped the <unk> work though a touch of the old <unk> still <unk> and now goes on the road with piano bass a slide show and a <unk> that ranges from light classical to light jazz to light pop with a few notable exceptions \r\n just the thing for the <unk> set the <unk> audience that has embraced new age as its very own easy listening \r\n but you ca n't dismiss mr. stoltzman 's music or his <unk> as merely commercial and <unk> \r\n he believes in what he plays and he plays <unk> \r\n his recent appearance at the metropolitan museum dubbed a musical <unk> was a case in point \r\n it felt more like a party or a highly <unk> <unk> session with a few friends than a classical concert \r\n <unk> in his trademark black <unk> suit the <unk> <unk> announced that his new <unk> inner voices had just been released that his family was in the front row and that it was his mother 's birthday so he was going to play her favorite tune from the record \r\n he launched into <unk> 's the <unk> from carnival of the animals a favorite <unk> piece for <unk> with lovely glossy tone and no <unk> \r\n then as if to show that he could play fast as well he offered the second movement from <unk> 's <unk> for <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> that reflected the <unk> side of the stoltzman <unk> \r\n and so it went through the first half an <unk> chosen <unk> of pieces none longer than five minutes none that would <unk> or challenge a <unk> \r\n mr. stoltzman introduced his colleagues bill douglas <unk> and an old buddy from yale and jazz <unk> eddie <unk> \r\n an <unk> section was built around pieces by mr. douglas beginning with golden rain a <unk> <unk> lead in to the <unk> sky which gave mr. stoltzman the opportunity to <unk> in a high register and show off his fleet fingers \r\n <unk> 's air followed \r\n mr. stoltzman tied the <unk> in by <unk> him the great <unk> of the <unk> century and then built on the image by joining with mr. douglas in some <unk> two-part <unk> <unk> arranged for <unk> and <unk> by mr. douglas \r\n keeping the mood light the two then <unk> and <unk> their way through some <unk> <unk> devised by mr. douglas as an alternative to <unk> 's dry <unk> techniques and then with mr. <unk> soared and <unk> on the <unk> 's tight <unk> <unk> \r\n the end of the first half however brought what the <unk> crowd seemed to be waiting for the pop singer <unk> collins who appears on inner voices \r\n glamorous and <unk> as ever ms. collins sang <unk> mitchell 's for free about an <unk> with a <unk> <unk> to which mr. stoltzman contributed a <unk> <unk> and mr. douglas 's <unk> setting of a <unk> blessing deep peace \r\n deep peace also featured a slide show of lovely but predictable images of clouds <unk> <unk> <unk> etc \r\n it was all too <unk> to be believed but they probably would have gotten away with it had they not felt <unk> to add ms. collins 's signature tune amazing grace and ask for audience participation \r\n that went over the permissible line for warm and <unk> feelings \r\n was this why some of the audience <unk> before or during the second half \r\n or was it because ms. collins had gone \r\n either way it was a <unk> because mr. <unk> offered the most substantial music of the evening just after <unk> steve reich 's new york <unk> one of a series of reich works that <unk> a live performer with recorded tracks of his or her own playing \r\n mr. reich 's new different trains for string <unk> uses the technique <unk> \r\n mr. stoltzman must have worried that his audience might not be able to take it he warned us in advance that new york <unk> lasts N N minutes \r\n he also unfortunately illustrated this <unk> <unk> <unk> with mr.

the concert was more straight jazz and <unk> sounds written by charlie parker <unk> coleman bill douglas and eddie <unk> with pictures for the douglas pieces \r\n it was <unk> to hear accomplished jazz without having to sit in a <unk> club but like the first half much of it was easy to take and ultimately <unk> \r\n is this the future of chamber music \r\n managers and <unk> insist that chamber music <unk> are a hard sell but can audiences really enjoy them only if the music is <unk> of threatening elements served up in <unk> <unk> and accompanied by <unk> \r\n what 's next \r\n <unk> to illustrate <unk> <unk> \r\n it was not an <unk> evening certainly thanks to the high level of performance the <unk> <unk> of mr. douglas and the obvious <unk> with which mr. stoltzman chooses his

the united states to <unk> this <unk> group \r\n now unesco <unk> are lobbying president bush to <unk> on president reagan 's decision to <unk> \r\n but we can think of many reasons to stay out for the foreseeable future and well beyond \r\n the u.s. along with britain and singapore left the agency when its <unk> <unk> financial corruption and top leadership got out of hand \r\n the personal

john <unk> the assistant secretary of state for international organizations told congress that the continuing <unk> restrictive <unk> programs make <unk> any time soon extremely unlikely \r\n this has n't much bothered the unesco delegates who last week could n't even agree to raise funds by selling off a fancy <unk> french <unk> the agency somehow owns \r\n other countries including west germany may have a hard time <unk> continued membership \r\n we see an even stronger argument against unesco than its <unk> failure to reform \r\n this is that the reagan revolution <unk> eastern europe and <unk> square shows the power of ideas <unk> by international civil <unk> or government <unk> \r\n free markets free minds and free elections have an appeal that seems to get <unk> only when delivered through u.n. organizations which of course are made up largely of governments that fear these principles at home \r\n the <unk> of the united nations are experts at <unk> \r\n this can have its purposes at times but there 's no reason to cloud the importance and <unk> of western <unk> of freedom and justice \r\n we can see plenty of reasons to stay out and none to <unk> unesco \r\n researchers at plant genetic systems n.v. in belgium said they have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid plants for a number of key crops \r\n the researchers said they have isolated a plant gene that prevents the production of <unk> \r\n the gene thus can prevent a plant from <unk> itself \r\n such so-called <unk> plants can then be <unk> by <unk> from another strain of the plant thereby producing hybrid seed \r\n the new generation of plants will <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> known as hybrid <unk> similar to that now seen in hybrid corn \r\n the development could have a dramatic effect on farm production especially cotton said murray robinson president of delta & <unk> land co. a <unk> inc. subsidiary that is one of the largest cotton seed producers in the u.s. \r\n on a commercial scale the <unk> of the <unk> male part has only been achieved in corn and <unk> feed grains \r\n that 's because the male part the <unk> and the female the <unk> are some distance apart on the corn plant \r\n in a <unk> process the seed companies cut off the <unk> of each plant making it male <unk> \r\n they <unk> a row of <unk> plants nearby which then <unk> the <unk> plants \r\n the first hybrid corn seeds produced using this mechanical approach were introduced in the 1930s and they yielded as much as N N more corn than naturally <unk> plants \r\n the vast majority of the u.s. corn crop now is grown from hybrid seeds produced by seed companies \r\n a similar technique is almost impossible to apply to other crops such as cotton soybeans and rice \r\n the male part the <unk> of the plant and the female the <unk> of the same plant are within a fraction of an inch or even attached to each other \r\n the <unk> in these plants are difficult to <unk> off \r\n in china a great number of workers are engaged in pulling out the male <unk> of rice plants using <unk> and one-third of rice produced in that country is grown from hybrid seeds \r\n at plant genetic systems researchers have isolated a <unk> gene that can be inserted in a plant to <unk> male <unk> \r\n jan <unk> research director said this gene was successfully introduced in <unk> <unk> plants a major crop in europe and canada using as a carrier a <unk> gene developed by robert goldberg at the university of california in los angeles \r\n the <unk> gene is expressed just before the <unk> is about to develop and it <unk> the <unk> of every <unk> in the plant \r\n mr. <unk> said this genetic manipulation does n't hurt the growth of that plant \r\n the researchers also pulled off a second genetic engineering <unk> in order to get <unk> plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop \r\n they attached a second gene for <unk> resistance to the <unk> gene \r\n both genes are then inserted into a few greenhouse plants which are then <unk> and allowed to mature and produce seed \r\n the laws of <unk> <unk> that half of the plants <unk> from these <unk> seeds will be male <unk> and <unk> <unk> and half will be male <unk> and <unk> susceptible \r\n the application of <unk> would kill off the <unk> plants leaving a large field of <unk> plants that can be <unk> to produce hybrid seed \r\n mr. <unk> said the hybrid <unk> created with this genetic engineering yield N N to N N more output than the commercial <unk> used currently \r\n this technique is applicable to a wide variety of crops he said and added that some modifications may be necessary to accommodate the <unk> of each type of crop \r\n he said the company is <unk> with the technique on <unk> and plans to include cotton and corn among other crops \r\n he said that even though virtually all corn seeds currently planted are <unk> the genetic approach will <unk> the need for mechanical <unk> of <unk> which costs u.s. seed producers about $ N million annually \r\n in recent years demand for hybrid seeds has spurred research at a number of chemical and biotechnology companies including monsanto co. shell oil co. and eli lilly & co \r\n one technique developed by some of these companies involves a chemical <unk> supposed to kill only a plant 's <unk> \r\n but there have been problems with chemical <unk> damaging plants ' female reproductive <unk> and concern for the <unk> of such chemical <unk> to humans animals and beneficial <unk> \r\n however paul <unk> monsanto 's director of plant sciences said the company 's chemical <unk> <unk> these problems and is <unk> on the female <unk> \r\n <unk> genetics corp. <unk> calif. is developing a <unk> containing a gene that spreads from cell to cell and <unk> with the genes that are responsible for producing <unk> \r\n this gene called <unk> is carried into the plant by a virus that remains active for a few days \r\n robert <unk> president of <unk> called plant genetic 's approach interesting and novel and <unk> rather than competitive \r\n there is a large market out there <unk> for hybrid seeds he said \r\n mr. robinson of delta & <unk> the seed producer in scott <unk> said plant genetic 's success in creating genetically engineered male <unk> does n't automatically mean it would be simple to create <unk> in all crops \r\n that 's because <unk> while easy in corn because the carrier is wind is more complex and involves <unk> as carriers in crops such as cotton \r\n it 's one thing to say you can <unk> and another to then successfully <unk> the plant he said \r\n nevertheless he said he is negotiating with plant genetic to acquire the technology to try breeding hybrid cotton \r\n a bitter conflict with global implications has erupted between nomura securities co. and industrial bank of japan two of the world 's most powerful financial companies \r\n the clash is a sign of a new <unk> and <unk> in japan 's <unk> financial circles \r\n not only are japan 's financial institutions putting their enormous clout to work increasingly they 're <unk> off against one another in unprecedented public fashion \r\n already the consequences are being felt by other players in the financial markets even governments \r\n what triggered the latest clash was a <unk> over the timing of a new zealand government bond issue \r\n nomura was attempting to <unk> the N <unk> $ N million borrowing in japan at a time when many japanese banks led by industrial bank of japan were <unk> the wellington government to help them recover loans made to a <unk> investment bank that had been owned by new zealand 's <unk> pension fund \r\n unwilling to put up new money for new zealand until those debts are repaid most banks refused even to play administrative roles in the new financing forcing an embarrassed nomura to postpone it this week \r\n the dispute shows clearly the global power of japan 's financial <unk> \r\n aside from nomura 's injured pride the biggest victim so far has been the new zealand government \r\n barred by its budget law from making any new domestic bond issues wellington 's debt management office had been casting abroad to raise the N billion new zealand dollars us$ N billion to <unk> N billion it needs to come up with by the end of its fiscal year next june N \r\n with japan 's <unk> banks aligned against it though raising money may be difficult \r\n not only can they block wellington from raising money in japan bankers here say but as the largest underwriters in the <unk> market they might be able to scuttle borrowings there too \r\n new zealand 's finance minister david <unk> <unk> out at such suggestions \r\n he told reporters in wellington tuesday that the government had n't guaranteed the loans to <unk> new zealand ltd. an investment bank <unk> by the national <unk> fund and would n't bail it out \r\n it may very well be what the japanese banks want he told radio new zealand \r\n i think it would be irresponsible and i am not about to be <unk> by japanese banks or any other international interests \r\n no less significant than the japanese banks ' attempt to cut off funds to pressure a foreign government are the implications of a confrontation between japan securities and banking industries \r\n anxiety is rising over recent government proposals to eventually lower the strict barriers that now separate and protect the two industries from each other \r\n both sides are <unk> <unk> their turf and relations have been

and industrial bank of japan japan 's most innovative and aggressive bank in capital markets abroad <unk> the opposing sides \r\n and their <unk> of each other run deep \r\n in the past year both have tried to stretch the limits of their businesses \r\n nomura started a credit-card venture with american express co. that allowed <unk> to use their nomura securities accounts like a bank account attracting the <unk> of banks \r\n and industrial bank of japan started up a london securities subsidiary that sells japanese stocks to <unk> institutions overseas a move that <unk> the anger of the

takeover of the auto maker \r\n trade and industry secretary nicholas ridley told the house of commons yesterday that he will <unk> the government 's so-called golden share in the company as long as jaguar shareholders agree \r\n the golden share restricts any individual holding to N N and expires at the end of N \r\n it was in jaguar 's best interests for the company 's future to be assured and the present climate of uncertainty resolved as quickly as possible mr. ridley said \r\n mr. ridley 's decision fires the starting <unk> for perhaps a costly contest between the world 's auto giants for britain 's leading luxury-car maker \r\n both general motors corp. and ford motor co. have been trying to <unk> N N stakes in jaguar \r\n ford which already has an unwelcome N N holding is prepared to bid for the entire company and had lobbied the government to lift the takeover restrictions early \r\n gm has been negotiating a friendly transaction with jaguar that likely would involve

depositary receipts closed at $ N up $ N \r\n analysts expect ford will make the first move perhaps today with an initial offer of about N pence $ N a share \r\n such a proposal values jaguar at more than # N billion $ N billion \r\n speculation about a takeover fight has sent jaguar shares soaring in the past six weeks \r\n the share price was <unk> at about N pence before ford 's sept. N announcement of its interest in a minority stake \r\n ford is in the driving seat at the moment observed bob barber an auto analyst at brokers james capel & co \r\n an aggressive ford bid for jaguar would put pressure on gm to make a better offer as the british company 's white knight \r\n such a <unk> could end jaguar 's hopes for remaining independent and <unk> \r\n but it is n't clear how long gm would be willing to fight ford for jaguar \r\n because of their longstanding <unk> gm just wants to make sure ford pays a huge <unk> for jaguar said john lawson an auto analyst at london 's nomura research institute \r\n people close to the <unk> talks agreed that ford now may be able to shut out general motors \r\n it 's either going to be a <unk> or there only may be one player in town one person said \r\n another person close to the talks said it is very hard to justify paying a silly price for jaguar if an <unk> bidding war were to start now \r\n in a statement jaguar 's board said they were not <unk> about the ridley decision in advance and were surprised at the action taken \r\n the statement emphasized that holders representing N N of the shares voting at a special shareholders ' meeting must agree to lift the takeover restrictions \r\n jaguar officials in the u.s. noted that ford as jaguar 's largest shareholder now has the power to call for such a meeting \r\n u.s. auto analysts also noted that ford is in the best position to benefit from the large number of jaguar shares that have moved over the past month into the hands of arbitragers waiting for the highest takeover bid \r\n jaguar 's own defenses against a hostile bid are weakened analysts add because fewer than N N of its shares are owned by employees and management \r\n ford officials in the u.s. declined to comment on the british government 's action or on any plans to call a special jaguar shareholders meeting \r\n but gm officials said they too were surprised by the move which left them to consider all our options and explore matters further \r\n although gm has u.s. approval to buy up to N N of jaguar 's stock it has n't yet disclosed how many shares it now owns \r\n in a prepared statement gm suggested its plans for jaguar would be more valuable in the long run than the initial <unk> investors might reap from a hostile ford bid \r\n our intensive discussions with jaguar at their invitation gm said have as their objectives to create a cooperative business relationship with jaguar that would provide for the continued independence of this great british car company to ensure a secure future for its employees and to provide an attractive long-term return for its shareholders \r\n jaguar was shocked by mr. ridley 's decision because management had believed the government would n't lift the golden share without consulting the company first \r\n indeed the government is taking a calculated risk \r\n mr. ridley 's announcement set off a <unk> of protests from members of the opposition labor party who accused the thatcher administration of backing down on promised protection for a privatized company \r\n the british government retained the single golden share after selling its stake in jaguar in \r\n the conservative government 's decision may reflect its desire to shed a politically sensitive issue well before the next election expected in late N \r\n it 's now a very good time politically to get this over and done with observed daniel jones professor of motor industry management at the university of <unk> in <unk> \r\n the government already <unk> by high interest rates and a slowing economy has been badly hurt by last week 's <unk> in mrs. thatcher 's cabinet \r\n at the same time the government did n't want to appear to favor gm by allowing a minority stake that might preclude a full bid by ford \r\n mr. ridley hinted at this motive in <unk> questions from members of parliament after his announcement \r\n he said he was

N respectively \r\n however cds sold through major broker-dealer networks were up slightly almost across the board \r\n the average six-month cd in that category added N percentage point to N N for

finding a <unk> machine in paris my fellow <unk> were having none of it \r\n the <unk> at my table simply <unk> more <unk> and <unk> at the suggestion of <unk> a perfectly good saturday morning to go <unk> or even <unk> ballooning to you the brothers <unk> french of course were the world 's first <unk> <unk> \r\n back in the u.s.a. this kind of <unk> <unk> activity wins <unk> <unk> responses \r\n as in you went ballooning \r\n in france \r\n americans it seems have followed malcolm <unk> 's <unk> lead and taken to ballooning in a <unk> way \r\n during the past N years the number of <unk> those who have passed a federal aviation authority <unk> test have swelled from a couple hundred to several thousand with some estimates running as high as N \r\n some N balloon shows are held annually in the u.s. including the world 's largest <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> international balloon <unk> that attracts some N enthusiasts and more than N <unk> some of which are <unk> <unk> to resemble <unk> <unk> <unk> or a <unk> <unk> \r\n the <unk> balloon was denied official entry status this year \r\n but in <unk> a gray <unk> river town adjacent to france 's <unk> mountain region none of these <unk> <unk> for things <unk> was evident \r\n ballooning at the de <unk> hour of N a.m. held all the attraction for most people of <unk> <unk> work \r\n feeling the <unk> of a culture <unk> i promptly signed up \r\n the first thing anybody will tell you about ballooning is that it requires zip in the way of athletic <unk> or even a measure of <unk> \r\n so long as you do n't look down \r\n they will also tell you that even if you hate heights you can still balloon \r\n i still say do n't look down \r\n at least not when you are <unk> \r\n what they wo n't tell you is not to go <unk> in anything you do n't want to get <unk> \r\n i 'm not referring to the traditional champagne <unk> during the <unk> <unk> \r\n i 'm talking about landing in a <unk> \r\n in a <unk> <unk> basket \r\n with a pilot who speaks no english \r\n to <unk> my <unk> <unk> and <unk> are referred to as <unk> began at <unk> on a <unk> <unk> and ended at noon in a <unk> field \r\n balloon flights almost always occur at <unk> or <unk> when the <unk> are <unk> \r\n in between came lots of coffee drinking while watching the <unk> <unk> and lots of standing around deciding who would fly in what balloon and in what order the baskets hold no more than four passengers \r\n when it was n't my turn in the balloon i followed its progress from the chase car listening to the driver <unk> into a <unk> \r\n after long <unk> of this <unk> ground activity came N or so lovely minutes of <unk> above the <unk> watching the silver <unk> rise off the river and the french <unk> <unk> about the fields \r\n it 's hard not to feel that god 's in his <unk> with this kind of <unk> view of the world even if your <unk> in silly <unk> <unk> kept pointing out how <unk> it all was \r\n eventually little french farmers and their little french <unk> came out of their stone houses and put their hands above their tiny eyes and <unk> at us \r\n no wonder \r\n we were coming down straight into their <unk> \r\n see the other rule of <unk> about ballooning is that you ca n't steer \r\n and neither can your pilot \r\n you can go only up or down by heating the balloon 's air with a propane <unk> which does make the top of your head feel hot and ride the air <unk> \r\n which makes the chase car necessary \r\n most <unk> seldom go higher than N feet and most average a <unk> N miles an hour \r\n when the balloon is <unk> along at a steady <unk> there is little sense of motion \r\n only when one is <unk> or in our case <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> does one feel well <unk> in a <unk> basket \r\n what 's he doing <unk> my companion who was the only other <unk> member of the convention and whose <unk> were white \r\n attention <unk> our pilot as our basket plunged into the <unk> \r\n you bet attention i <unk> back leaping <unk> the propane tanks i 'm wearing <unk> <unk> \r\n our pilot simply <unk> fired up the <unk> and with another blast of <unk> lifted us oh a good <unk> above the water level \r\n we <unk> along for a few feet before he plunged us into the drink again \r\n eventually we came to rest in a <unk> patch of field where we had the <unk> pleasure of scrambling out of the basket into the <unk> while the french half of our ballooning tag team scrambled in \r\n i looked at my watch \r\n barely <unk> <unk> \r\n back in the chase car we drove around some more got stuck in a <unk> <unk> the aid of a local farmer to get out the <unk> <unk> and pull us out of the <unk> \r\n we finally <unk> with our balloon which had come to rest on a <unk> road amid a <unk> of <unk> who watched us <unk> our craft another <unk> of <unk> activity that included the precision routine of <unk> the balloon to the ground <unk> all the air out of it rolling it up and <unk> it and the basket into the <unk> \r\n it was the most exercise we 'd had all morning and it was followed by our driving immediately to the <unk> <unk> hole \r\n this meant returning to the golf course where we watched a few french <unk> <unk> the first <unk> while we sat under <unk> <unk> me nursing an <unk> and my <unk> \r\n a whole morning of ballooning and i had been off the ground barely N minutes \r\n still i figured the event 's <unk> back in the u.s.a. was near <unk> \r\n as for the ride back to camp our pilot and all the other <unk> passengers <unk> into the chase car \r\n my american companion and i were left to ride

defended the treasury 's efforts this fall to drive down the value of the dollar saying it helped minimize damage from the 190-point drop in the stock market oct. N \r\n <unk> before a house subcommittee mr. mulford said that if the treasury had n't intervened in foreign-exchange markets in september and early october to reduce the dollar 's value the plunge in the stock market might have provoked a steep fall in the currency that might have <unk> financial markets \r\n mr. mulford responding to critics of intervention also said intervention is highly visible is taken seriously by financial markets and works better than was recognized some time ago \r\n differences between the treasury and the federal reserve on the <unk> of intervention to help restrain the dollar <unk> at the hearing \r\n fed vice chairman manuel johnson who had <unk> from the treasury 's policy told lawmakers i became convinced about what looked to me like an attempt to push the dollar down against the fundamentals in the market \r\n intervention he added is useful only to smooth <unk> markets not to fundamentally influence the dollar 's value \r\n rep. john <unk> d. n.y said mr. johnson refused to testify jointly with mr. mulford and instead asked to appear after the treasury official had completed his testimony \r\n a fed spokesman denied mr. <unk> 's statement \r\n mr. mulford said reports of tension between the treasury and fed have been <unk> insisting that they involved <unk> \r\n mr. johnson also said that in the scheme of things these things are minor \r\n on other matters mr. mulford said west germany is contributing to imbalances in the world economy because of its success as an exporter \r\n the solution is stronger domestic growth in germany he said \r\n but because the growth of the german economy has been stronger than expected mr. mulford said it 's difficult for the u.s. to argue that germany ought to adopt more <unk> monetary and fiscal policies \r\n germany 's trade surplus is largely with other european countries rather than with the u.s. mr. mulford acknowledged \r\n but nonetheless u.s. companies might be more successful in european markets if not for the german export push he said \r\n the board increased by one to N members \r\n in the past year one inside director resigned while three others retired \r\n some u.s. allies are complaining that president bush is pushing <unk> talks too quickly creating a risk that negotiators will make errors that could affect the security of western europe for years \r\n concerns about the pace of the vienna talks which are aimed at the destruction of some N weapons as well as major reductions and <unk> of troops in central europe also are being registered at the pentagon \r\n mr. bush has called for an agreement by next september at the latest \r\n but some american defense officials believe the north atlantic treaty organization should take more time to examine the long-term implications of the options being considered \r\n for one thing pentagon officials who asked not to be identified worry that the u.s. will have a much tougher time <unk> europeans to keep some <unk> nuclear weapons on their soil once soviet <unk> forces are <unk> out \r\n at the same time they contend that a reduction of nato forces under a treaty will increase the possibility of a conventional soviet attack unless the west retains a <unk> force of nuclear weapons in europe \r\n allies concerned about the deadline include the british french and smaller nato allies some of whom do n't have adequate staffs to provide quick answers to the questions being raised by what generally are considered the most complex arms-control talks ever attempted \r\n so far no ally has complained openly preserving the impression that nato is in line with the bush position that a quick agreement bringing soviet conventional forces down to parity with nato is the west 's top bargaining priority \r\n but even though nato negotiators have only N months left under the bush timetable they are still <unk> over such seemingly fundamental questions as what is a tank \r\n five of the six categories of weapons under negotiation have n't even been defined \r\n tanks currently are defined as <unk> vehicles weighing N tons or more that carry large guns \r\n the soviets complicated the issue by offering to include light tanks which are as light as N tons \r\n <unk> a. <unk> the chief soviet negotiator in the <unk> talks argued that this would mean the soviets would have to destroy some N tanks while the u.s. would lose none because it has no light tanks in europe \r\n but the issue is <unk> than it seems \r\n france britain and italy all have light tanks they would like to keep out of the talks \r\n and some u.s. army analysts worry that the proposed soviet <unk> is aimed at blocking the u.s. from developing lighter more <unk> high-technology tanks \r\n <unk> combat aircraft is even tougher \r\n the soviets insisted that aircraft be brought into the talks then argued for <unk> some N russian planes because they are solely defensive \r\n nato has n't <unk> from its insistence that any <unk> plane has offensive capability \r\n the dispute over that issue according to one u.s. official is a potential treaty <unk> and only president bush and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev may be able to resolve it \r\n accounting problems raise more <unk> issues \r\n greece and turkey for example are suspected of <unk> their <unk> in hopes that they can emerge from the <unk> treaty with large remaining forces to deter each other \r\n other nations are n't sure how many weapons they have in their own <unk> \r\n it 's just going to be sloppy both on our side and theirs the warsaw pact 's says one nato analyst \r\n so far neither the bush administration nor arms-control experts in congress seem moved by arguments that these problems may take more time to <unk> out than president bush has allowed \r\n they argue that the bigger danger would be that the west would delay action so long that the soviets might back away from the current <unk> attitude \r\n so what if you miss N tanks somewhere asks rep. norman <unk> d. wash. a member of the house group that visited the talks in vienna \r\n the bottom line is that if we can get that warsaw pact <unk> brought down to parity we ought to keep pressing ahead as quickly as possible \r\n i worry more about things becoming so unraveled on the other side that they might become unable to negotiate \r\n

bottling operations in australia new zealand and france \r\n the move also reflects coke 's eagerness to have a hand in developing the soft-drink markets in pacific basin countries \r\n aside from europe the pacific division is where coke will be focusing much of its attention for years to come \r\n that 's because when coke looks to the pacific area it sees an economic and <unk> gold mine \r\n in countries such as taiwan south korea and singapore economies are growing resulting in a rise in disposable income that consumers can use for soft drinks \r\n and unlike europe and the u.s. where

companies in the u.s. and overseas coke has been able to improve <unk> ' efficiency and production and in some cases marketing \r\n coke has <unk> to increase its control when results were sluggish in a given country \r\n that does n't appear to be the case in singapore a country of about three million people with a relatively high soft-drink consumption rate a key indicator of coke 's success in a

help armstrong <unk> its investors and deter the <unk> who own a N N stake in the lancaster pa. company \r\n analysts expect armstrong to use proceeds of the sale to reduce debt buy back stock or perhaps finance an acquisition \r\n the carpet division had N sales of $ N million or almost N N of armstrong 's $ N billion total revenue \r\n the company has been manufacturing carpet since N \r\n recently it upgraded its plants so that it could make <unk> products with higher quality <unk> \r\n for the past year or two the carpet division 's operating profit margins have <unk> around N N high

on the degree to which the u.s. economy is slowing \r\n the small increase in the index of leading indicators which had climbed N N in august but was unchanged in july does lend support to the view that the economy has slowed <unk> \r\n however it does n't give much of a clue as to whether a recession is on the horizon \r\n i do n't think it provides much new information on the economy said richard <unk> economist at dean witter reynolds inc \r\n so far this year the index of leading indicators has risen in four months fallen in four months and remained unchanged in the other month \r\n in another report yesterday the commerce department said sales of new single-family houses plunged N N in september to an annual rate of N from N in august \r\n the declines were particularly <unk> in the northeast and in the south where hurricane hugo was a factor \r\n although september 's weakness followed two strong months for home sales the decline supports other indications that the drop in mortgage rates earlier this year has had only a limited beneficial effect on the housing market \r\n the september drop was the largest since a N N drop in january N but monthly changes in this measure are even less <unk> than those in other economic indicators \r\n because the figures are based on a small sample the department said it is N N confident only that new-home sales fell somewhere between N N and N N during the month \r\n the department also said it takes four months to establish a trend \r\n so far this year N newly built homes have been sold down N N from the like months of N \r\n the index of leading indicators got a major boost in september from a surge in consumer expectations as measured by the university of michigan \r\n this measure had dropped sharply in august \r\n the commerce department said that as a result of a new adjustment to the formula used to calculate the index the influence of this component has been reduced \r\n of the N components to the index only three others rose in september the money supply the length of the average work week and stock prices \r\n several components that track the health of the manufacturing sector of the economy turned down in september \r\n these include new orders for manufactured consumer goods lead times on vendor deliveries orders for new plant and equipment and backlogs of orders for durable goods \r\n meanwhile the national association of manufacturers said yesterday a recent poll of N executives on its board found that N N do n't expect a recession to occur until N or later \r\n the remainder expect a downturn to begin sometime in \r\n although manufacturers often are quick to call for lower interest rates N N of the executives said they would prefer that the fed keep <unk> as its top priority even if that means higher rates \r\n the other N N said the fed ought to worry less about inflation and bring interest rates down \r\n all the figures are adjusted to remove usual seasonal patterns \r\n here are the net contributions of the components of the commerce department 's index of leading indicators \r\n after various adjustments they produced a N N rise in the index for august and a N N rise for september \r\n september and the change from august are from N in the previous month \r\n boston edison co. said it will take a previously reported $ N million charge against

the international telecommunications network to break into more than N <unk> computers in the u.s. searching for secrets \r\n he probably did n't <unk> any <unk> files but the kgb in east berlin was willing to pay two of his associates peter carl and <unk> <unk> $ N for some of the material hess collected \r\n they promised yet more for really good stuff \r\n mr. stoll draws his title from the <unk> 's habit of laying eggs in the <unk> of other birds making them <unk> parents \r\n the computer spy had discovered that a popular <unk> mail program called <unk> could do <unk> with the widely used unix operating system created by at&t \r\n using <unk> the spy could substitute a <unk> <unk> program for the one that routinely <unk> up the unix system every five minutes \r\n once his <unk> 's egg was laid he could enter unix and become a <unk> with access to everything \r\n mr. stoll was <unk> the <unk> at the <unk> <unk> of the lawrence berkeley laboratory in N when his grant ran low and he was asked to switch to helping run the lab 's computers \r\n he discovered a <unk> <unk> in the charges made to various departments for computer time and <unk> it to a user named hunter who had no valid billing address \r\n mr. stoll suspected the <unk> was one of those <unk> students who has fun breaking into computers \r\n but after much tracking it became evident to mr. stoll through various clues that the hacker was not on the berkeley campus or even in california \r\n finding him became an <unk> for mr. stoll \r\n he made a midnight <unk> of all the printers he could lay hands on so that he could monitor all the telephone lines coming into the lab 's computers \r\n after <unk> that the hacker had taken over the <unk> account of a legitimate user named joe <unk> he <unk> up an alarm system including a portable <unk> to alert him when <unk> came on the line \r\n some nights he <unk> under his desk \r\n his boss complained about <unk> of other chores \r\n the hacker was <unk> over the berkeley files but also using berkeley and other easily accessible computers as stepping stones to the network of computers used by the military and national security agencies \r\n the white <unk> missile range and cia contractor <unk> inc. were among the targets \r\n when the hacker moved mr. stoll moved too calling up other systems managers to alert them but keeping his own system open to avoid <unk> <unk> \r\n sometimes if the hacker seemed to be into a sensitive file he would drag his <unk> across the terminal to create <unk> or slow the system down to <unk> his <unk> \r\n the fbi initially showed little interest and he had the impression other federal security agencies were <unk> up in legal red tape \r\n the cia told him it does not do domestic <unk> \r\n one <unk> a lot from this book or seems to about <unk> federal bureaucracy \r\n seems to because it 's possible that the cia and the national security agency were more interested than they let on to mr. stoll \r\n finally he got help \r\n <unk> is a major network linking computers \r\n one of its international specialists steve white took a quick interest in mr. stoll 's hunt ultimately <unk> the hacker to west germany \r\n the west germans then took over and finally found <unk> hess \r\n eventually mr. stoll was invited to both the cia and <unk> to brief <unk> officers on computer theft \r\n he <unk> the humor of

\r\n mips computer systems inc. today will unveil a new <unk> computer that will compete with more expensive machines from companies such as sun microsystems inc. and digital equipment corp \r\n the closely held sunnyvale calif. company also will announce an agreement to supply computers to control data corp. which will sell mips machines under its own label \r\n the new mips machine called the <unk> will cost $ N for a basic system \r\n the computer processes N million instructions per second and uses only one central processing chip unlike many rival machines using several processors \r\n the machine employs reduced <unk> computing or risc technology \r\n at that price an analyst familiar with the machine said the computer offers up to N times the performance of similar machines \r\n in the price range it 's a <unk> <unk> product said <unk> <unk> an analyst at the <unk> firm <unk> \r\n the machine is part of an effort by mips to establish itself as a supplier of computers not just of <unk> technology \r\n mips also wants to wedge into markets other than traditional risc applications such as engineering mips said the new machine will also be used by businesses and for communications \r\n this clearly demonstrates that mips is a systems company rather than just a chip company said mips vice president john <unk> \r\n the control data deal is a <unk> for mips because it gives the the <unk> company one more ally as it <unk> more established electronic concerns such as sun hewlett-packard co. motorola inc. and intel corp. for the emerging market for risc machines \r\n risc technology speeds up a computer by <unk> the internal software \r\n for mips which expects revenue of $ N million this year <unk> allies such as control data are essential to attract software developers to the company 's risc architecture \r\n the thing it says about mips is that they 're on a roll right now said ms. <unk> at <unk> \r\n they 're getting some major wins she added \r\n last month for example mips agreed to supply its computers to <unk> computer ag of west germany and france 's <unk> bull \r\n sony corp. tandem computers inc. and digital equipment have agreed to sell mips computers and companies such as japan 's nec corp. and west germany 's siemens a.g. have agreed to make mips chips under license \r\n today 's agreement gives control data a machine to compete against digital and other <unk> computer makers said john <unk> a <unk> analyst at <unk> group inc. of boston \r\n the machine is essentially a mainframe computer he said \r\n suddenly <unk> control data has a competitive product to fight back against the <unk> a machine digital announced last month he added \r\n control data based in minneapolis minn. expects its sales of mips systems including the new <unk> to amount to more than $ N million by the end of N mips said \r\n <unk> bull and others will also sell versions of the machine said mips president robert miller \r\n mips will start shipping its new machine in the first quarter of N he said \r\n the machine uses a single <unk> which makes it easier to program than competing machines using several processors \r\n the computer can process N million calculations called <unk> operations every second \r\n the machine can run software written for other mips computers the company said \r\n another fight is brewing between congress and the bush administration over how to pay for the savings-and-loan bailout without adding to the federal budget deficit \r\n in a hearing before the house ways and means committee the general accounting office and the congressional budget office which both are arms of congress advised the new s&l bailout agency to abandon plans to raise temporary working capital through debt issued from an agency that would n't be counted on the federal budget \r\n officials of the resolution trust corp. have said privately that such a plan was the most likely alternative to raise short-term cash for the bailout \r\n instead the <unk> and the congressional budget office said the rtc should consider using treasury debt which is less expensive and subject to oversight by congress \r\n the spending could be <unk> from meeting deficit-reduction targets in the gramm-rudman budget law \r\n the rtc has projected that it will require between $ N billion to $ N billion in temporary working capital \r\n the borrowing to raise these funds would be paid off as assets of sick thrifts are sold \r\n the new s&l law allows the rtc to issue notes for as much as N N of the value of the assets it holds \r\n but higher interest rates paid on <unk> debt could add billions to the bailout costs and would n't be subject to congressional scrutiny ways and means members argued \r\n to allow this massive level of <unk> federal borrowing without prior congressional approval would be irresponsible said rep. <unk> stark d. calif. who has introduced a bill to limit the rtc 's authority to issue debt \r\n the rtc will have to sell or merge hundreds of insolvent thrifts over the next three years \r\n the new s&l bailout law allows $ N billion to be spent to sell or merge sick s&ls and their assets but that is a net cost \r\n in the meantime the agency must raise cash to maintain assets such as real estate until they can be sold \r\n then the short-term debt is paid off through the proceeds of selling the assets \r\n david mullins assistant secretary of the treasury said that the working capital is necessary to reduce the final costs of the bailout by allowing the agency to sell savings and loans without their bad assets then hold the assets until they can be sold under favorable conditions \r\n he said it has n't yet been determined how the rtc will raise the cash but the administration does n't want it to be included on the federal budget because it would <unk> the budget process by requiring either <unk> from gramm-rudman or big increases in the budget deficit \r\n but the worst possibility would be raising no working capital he said \r\n if working capital financing is not provided he said the rtc may have to slow s&l sales or dump acquired assets through fire sales \r\n <unk> eastern corp. said it applied on behalf of two of its subsidiaries to the federal energy regulatory commission for permission to build a <unk> $ N million pipeline system from <unk>

interests in real estate that presented an alleged conflict of interest set up a <unk> corporation to buy a car and obtain insurance for his former girlfriend now his second wife and maintained N accounts in six banks in cambria county \r\n in testimony recorded in the grand jury report court employees said the judge now N years old <unk> his secretaries made imperial demands on his staff and <unk> anyone who crossed him \r\n <unk> claimed they were required to <unk> him to and from work <unk> his lawn <unk> his wood fix his car and even drop by his house to feed his two grown <unk> <unk> and <unk> \r\n one former <unk> charged that the judge <unk> him by <unk> on a promise of a better paying job after <unk> a $ N bribe \r\n some of the allegations are simply bizarre \r\n two former secretaries told the grand jury they were summoned to the judge 's chambers on separate occasions to take <unk> only to find the judge in his <unk> underwear \r\n one secretary testified that the judge once called her to his office while wearing nothing at all \r\n the judge suspended from his bench pending his trial which began this week <unk> denies all the allegations against him calling them <unk> and <unk> political <unk> \r\n he blames the indictment on local political <unk> <unk> with his aggressive efforts to clear the courthouse 's <unk> and a <unk> by state investigators and prosecutors angered by some of his rulings against them \r\n i do n't know whose <unk> i 've stepped on says the judge \r\n i 'll find out eventually who pushed the state police <unk> into action \r\n even if only some of the allegations stand up however they provide ample testimony to the <unk> power of judges in rural communities \r\n that power can sometimes be abused particularly since <unk> in smaller <unk> operate without many of the restraints that serve as <unk> measures in urban areas \r\n lawyers and their clients who frequently bring business to a country courthouse can expect to appear before the same judge year after year \r\n fear of <unk> that judge is pervasive says maurice <unk> founder and director of the rural justice center in <unk> <unk> a public interest group that <unk> rural justice issues \r\n as a result says mr. <unk> lawyers think twice before appealing a judge 's ruling are reluctant to mount or even support challenges against him for re-election and are usually loath to file complaints that might <unk> a judge 's integrity \r\n judge o'kicki a stern and <unk> man has been a <unk> in the local legal community for more than two decades \r\n the son of an <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> he was raised in a small borough outside <unk> the cambria county seat and put himself through the university of pittsburgh law school \r\n he <unk> near the top of his class serving on the school law review with richard thornburgh who went on to become governor of pennsylvania and now u.s. attorney general \r\n it was also in law school that mr. o'kicki and his first wife had the first of seven daughters \r\n he <unk> his first wife three years ago and married the daughter of his court clerk \r\n last year pennsylvania supreme court justice john p. <unk> called mr. o'kicki one of the <unk> judges not only in pennsylvania but in the united states \r\n clearly the judge has had his share of <unk> \r\n after practicing law locally he was elected to his first 10-year term as judge in N in N he was effectively <unk> \r\n six years ago judge o'kicki was voted president of the pennsylvania conference of state trial judges by the state 's N judges \r\n he has been considered several times for appointments to federal district and appellate court <unk> in pennsylvania \r\n and when he ran unsuccessfully for a state appellate court seat in N the pennsylvania bar association rated him one of the best available after <unk> local lawyers \r\n he probably was the <unk> guy who ever sat on our bench says a former president of cambria county 's <unk> bar association who like most lawyers in cambria county refuses to talk about the judge publicly \r\n he 's sharp as a <unk> \r\n he could grasp an issue with the <unk> of an eye \r\n for more than a decade virtually no one complained about judge o'kicki \r\n what about those institutions that are supposed to be the <unk> of society the banks and the bar association wrote a columnist for the <unk> a newspaper in nearby <unk> shortly after the scandal became public \r\n if only a banker or a lawyer had spoken out years ago the judicial process would n't be under the <unk> it is today \r\n officials with the pennsylvania judicial inquiry and review board the arm of the state that <unk> judicial misconduct counter that they had no <unk> of anything <unk> in <unk> \r\n nobody told us nobody called us says an official close to the case who asked not to be named \r\n nobody had the <unk> to complain \r\n certainly not the lawyers \r\n <unk> attorney richard j. green jr. <unk> out $ N in loans to the judge over five years he said in testimony to the grand jury \r\n the judge never made a <unk> of <unk> the money said mr. green \r\n eventually mr. green testified he began <unk> out of his office rather than face the judge when he visited \r\n when mr. green won a $ N verdict in a land <unk> case against the state in june N he says judge o'kicki unexpectedly awarded him an additional $ N \r\n mr. green thought little of it he told the grand jury until the judge walked up to him after the courtroom had cleared and suggested a <unk> \r\n do n't you think i ought to get a commission or part of your fee in this case mr. green said the judge asked him \r\n <unk> mr. green never paid the money he testified \r\n but he did n't complain to the state 's judicial inquiry and review board either saying later that he feared <unk> \r\n mr. o'kicki said he will respond to mr. green 's <unk> at his trial \r\n like most of cambria county 's lawyers and residents who had dealings with the judge mr. green declined to be interviewed for this article \r\n and no one with a complaint about the judge would allow his name to be printed \r\n i do n't have anything much to say and i think that 's what you 're going to find from everyone else you talk to up here says local attorney edward f. <unk> \r\n says another lawyer the practice of law is a matter of <unk> one 's <unk> when you live in a small community \r\n one had best not dance on top of a <unk> until the lid is <unk> tightly shut \r\n the judge was considered <unk> <unk> and ambitious those who practiced before him say \r\n he <unk> tea sweetened with <unk> from his <unk> leather chair at his bench while <unk> notes ordering <unk> to stop <unk> or to take off their hats in his courtroom \r\n four years ago he jailed all nine members of the cambria county school board for several hours after they <unk> his order to extend the school year by several weeks to make up for time lost during a teachers ' strike \r\n visitors in his chambers say he could cite precisely the years months weeks and days remaining until mandatory retirement would force aside the <unk> president judge giving judge o'kicki the seniority required to take over as the county 's top court administrator \r\n the judge they say was fiercely proud of his <unk> and <unk> \r\n my name is judge judge o'kicki told a car salesman in <unk> when he bought a new red <unk> <unk> in october N according to the <unk> report \r\n the dealership <unk> recorded the sale under the name judge o'kicki \r\n yet despite the judge 's imperial bearing no one ever had reason to suspect possible wrongdoing says john <unk> president of cambria county 's <unk> bar association \r\n the <unk> of a judge his <unk> the way he handles people are not a basis for filing a complaint says mr. <unk> \r\n until this came up and hit the press there was never any indication that he was doing anything wrong \r\n state investigators dispute that view now particularly in light of the judge 's various business dealings in cambria county \r\n the judge came under scrutiny in late N after the state attorney general 's office launched an unrelated investigation into corruption in cambria county \r\n the inquiry soon focused on the judge \r\n even his routine business transactions caused trouble according to the grand jury report \r\n when the judge bought his new <unk> from james e. black <unk> in <unk> five years ago the dealership had certain <unk> about the judge 's reputation according to the <unk> report \r\n the dealership took the extra step of having all the paper work for the transaction <unk> by <unk> 's local lender laurel bank \r\n then as an additional <unk> the car dealership took the judge 's photograph as he stood next to his new car with sales papers in hand proof that he had received the loan documents \r\n but when the judge received his payment book he <unk> the deal \r\n there was no loan there is no loan there never shall be a loan the judge wrote the bank on his judicial <unk> according to the report \r\n later the judge went a step <unk> \r\n after laurel bank tried to <unk> the car a vice president asked him to intervene in an unrelated legal dispute involving a trust account \r\n the judge wrote again \r\n i find myself in an adversary relationship with laurel bank and i am not inclined to extend myself as far as any favors are concerned the judge wrote back in a letter attached to the grand jury 's report \r\n perhaps if my personal matters can be resolved with laurel bank in the near future i may be inclined to reconsider your request \r\n the judge now says it was unfortunate that he chose to write the letter but says there was certainly no intent to <unk> there \r\n the bank <unk> \r\n it <unk> the judge 's loan lowered its interest rate and accepted a <unk> that had n't originally been part of the deal a beat up N chevy <unk> the dealer had to repair before it could be <unk> \r\n the incident was n't the only time the judge got special treatment from his local bank \r\n two years later he wrote to complain that the interest he was paying on an unsecured $ N loan was absolutely onerous \r\n paul l. kane laurel 's president at the time quickly responded \r\n the bank he wrote back was immediately lowering the rate by N N as a <unk> to you \r\n the judge says he ca n't discuss in detail how he will defend himself at his trial although he contends that if he were as corrupt as state prosecutors believe he would be far <unk> than he is \r\n his <unk> <unk> and brick house outside of <unk> is up for sale to pay for his lawyers \r\n the judge says he is confident he will return to his old bench \r\n already he notes the N charges originally filed against him have been trimmed to N \r\n most of the allegations no longer pending were ethics charges withdrawn by state prosecutors as part of a pre-trial agreement \r\n the heart of the case official <unk> remains intact \r\n if i lose i lose my position my career my pension my home and my investments says the judge \r\n my god and i know i am correct and innocent \r\n many

the tax court is n't expected to rule before early next year \r\n japan has found another safe <unk> for its money u.s. home mortgages \r\n an increasing number of big japanese investors are buying up u.s. home mortgages that have been <unk> and packaged for sale as <unk> instruments known as mortgage-backed securities \r\n as much as N N of new u.s. mortgage securities issued by the federal national mortgage association or fannie mae and federal home loan mortgage corp. or freddie mac now flow into japanese hands \r\n that may not come as a surprise to americans who have watched the japanese <unk> up properties in the u.s. from golf courses to a stake in rockefeller center \r\n but it marks a big change for the japanese who <unk> mortgage securities after getting burned by a big downturn in interest rates a few years back \r\n you ca n't say it 's a <unk> <unk> wave but we 're making some <unk> says fannie mae 's chairman david o. maxwell who visits tokyo at least once a year to explain and drum up investor interest in mortgage securities \r\n interest is a great deal higher than it was a year ago \r\n the steady growth of the mortgage securities market in the u.s. has even triggered talk of building up a similar market here \r\n evidence of the growing japanese demand for mortgage securities <unk> \r\n earlier this year blackstone group a new york investment bank had no trouble selling out a special $ N million <unk> trust it created for japanese investors \r\n industrial bank of japan which claims to be the biggest japanese buyer of u.s. mortgage securities says it will more than double its purchases this year to an amount one official puts at several billion dollars \r\n and a fannie mae <unk> this week promises to draw hundreds of prospective investors who can be expected to channel tens of billions of dollars into the market in the next few years \r\n last year there were only several big investors who were interested says <unk> <unk> a vice president at the international arm of nomura securities co \r\n this year some investors are changing their policies and investing a lot \r\n ultimately he says strong demand could help to drive down interest rates on mortgage securities \r\n at the moment nomura is the only japanese institution authorized to act as a primary seller of fannie mae instruments \r\n but other japanese institutions say privately that they are considering asking to join the <unk> selling group \r\n these securities are attractive to japanese investors for three reasons \r\n first they are safe \r\n while they are n't backed by the full faith and credit of the u.s. government as treasury bonds are it is widely assumed that the government would support them if necessary \r\n u.s. treasury bonds are still the dollar-denominated investment of choice for long-term japanese investors \r\n second they are liquid \r\n the secondary market in federally backed mortgage securities now exceeds $ N billion or nearly half of the $ N trillion in u.s. residential mortgages issued \r\n third they offer high yields \r\n at the moment some offer as much as N to N percentage points over treasury securities of similar maturities \r\n but there is a risk which the japanese discovered when they first dipped their <unk> into the market nearly five years ago \r\n since most mortgages can be prepaid or <unk> at any time issuers of mortgage securities retain the right to buy back their bonds before maturity \r\n that 's a <unk> for long-term investors since it forces them to reinvest their money usually at lower rates than the original mortgage securities carried \r\n two or three years ago the problem was that people did n't understand the prepayment risk says nomura 's mr. <unk> \r\n so they were surprised and very disappointed by prepayment \r\n <unk> the trouble to japanese investors mortgage securities pay interest monthly since most mortgages require homeowners to make monthly payments \r\n but japanese institutional investors are used to quarterly or semiannual payments on their investments so the monthly cash flow posed administrative problems \r\n as a result japanese investors <unk> clear of the mortgage securities \r\n but they did n't lose touch with the u.s. issuers \r\n since N japanese investors have bought nearly N N of $ N billion in fannie mae corporate debt issued to foreigners money that fannie mae uses to buy mortgages from u.s. banks \r\n and japanese investors took up nearly all of two $ N million real estate mortgage investment <unk> a kind of collateralized mortgage obligation that were offered to foreigners this year \r\n in addition further packaging of mortgage-backed securities such as blackstone 's fund have reduced the effects of prepayment risk and automatically reinvest monthly payments so institutions do n't have to \r\n freddie mac for years has offered a so-called participation certificate that guarantees it wo n't be prepaid for a set number of years and offers semiannual payments \r\n as georgia-pacific 's bid for great northern nekoosa has shown <unk> takeovers are still alive despite <unk> reports of their demise \r\n therefore the debate about poison pills will continue to rage in the <unk> of corporations and the halls of <unk> \r\n although poison pills come in different colors and <unk> they usually give current shareholders the right to buy more stock of their corporation at a large discount if certain events occur typically if a hostile bidder acquires more than a specified percentage of the corporation 's stock \r\n however these discount purchase rights may generally be redeemed at a nominal cost by the corporation 's directors if they approve of a bidder \r\n supporters of poison pills argue that their adoption forces bidders to negotiate with a corporation 's directors who are thereby put in a better position to pursue the long-term interests of the corporation \r\n recent studies by <unk> & co. conclude that corporations with poison pills have experienced greater <unk> appreciation than corporations without poison pills during the past few years \r\n critics of poison pills argue that they harm shareholders by letting corporate management defeat takeover bids at premium prices and by <unk> premium bids from ever being made to shareholders \r\n these critics are backed by several academic studies showing that the adoption of poison pills reduces shareholder values not merely in the short run but also over longer periods \r\n institutional investors that must evaluate poison pills on a regular basis are interested less in this general debate than in the answers to specific questions about the corporation issuing the pill \r\n does this corporation have a high-quality management team with a good track record \r\n does this team have a viable strategy for improving shareholder values and does this strategy require <unk> over an extended period \r\n will the adoption of this particular form of a poison pill significantly improve the chances for management to carry out this strategy \r\n if the answers to these questions are <unk> then institutional investors are likely to be <unk> <unk> toward a specific poison pill \r\n however the problem is that once most poison pills are adopted they survive forever \r\n although the current management team may be outstanding who will be the ceo in N years \r\n although the five-year strategy may be excellent what will be the strategy in N years \r\n the solution to this problem is a <unk> poison pill \r\n the limit could range from three years to seven years depending on the <unk> of the management team and the nature of its strategic plan \r\n at the end of this period the poison pill would be eliminated automatically unless a new poison pill were approved by the <unk> shareholders who would have an opportunity to evaluate the corporation 's strategy and management team at that time \r\n one rare example of a <unk> poison pill is the shareholder rights plan adopted by pennzoil last year after it received a huge litigation settlement from texaco \r\n pennzoil 's poison pill covers five years in order to give current management enough time to put these proceeds to work in a prudent manner \r\n another interesting example is the poison pill adopted recently by <unk> national intergroup inc. a diversified holding company \r\n the state of wisconsin investment board which owned about N N of the company 's voting stock worked with management to devise a <unk> poison pill \r\n this pill automatically expires after three years unless continued by a vote of the shareholders \r\n the attitude of the wisconsin investment board reflects a growing <unk> to <unk> poison pills on the part of institutional investors as shown by the discussions at recent meetings of the council of institutional investors and my informal survey of several retirement plans with large stock positions \r\n more widespread time limits on poison pills would allow shareholders to evaluate a specific poison pill within the context of a specific management team 's strategy \r\n such concrete analysis is likely to lead to more <unk> dialogue between management and shareholders than the <unk> debate about poison pills \r\n mr. <unk> is the general counsel and a managing director of fidelity investments in boston \r\n michael blair former president and chief executive officer of enfield corp. failed to win election to the company 's board at a special shareholder meeting \r\n mr. blair said after the meeting

for atlanta 's ibm tower last year \r\n altogether annual japanese investment in u.s. commercial real estate grew from about $ N billion in N to about $ N billion in N \r\n many japanese companies have taken the warnings by the country 's leaders to heart and sought development partnerships rather than landmark properties \r\n critics say mitsubishi estate 's decision to buy into rockefeller reflects the degree to which companies are <unk> by the pressure to act for the good of japan \r\n those who have no money and are n't buying think it 's right to <unk> but those with money who want to buy for themselves pay no attention says an official of the <unk> business council \r\n but to mitsubishi estate the acquisition has just the elements that should win support from both sides \r\n first of all it is a friendly acquisition in which rockefeller sought out mitsubishi estate and asked it to buy a majority share \r\n <unk> the two companies found a similarity in their business and development <unk> and intend to cooperate in a range of activities from real estate to telecommunications \r\n finally mitsubishi estate has no plans to interfere with rockefeller 's management beyond taking a place on the board \r\n we 'll continue to work with them in keeping with the reputation of the company and we 'll rely very much on their leadership says mitsubishi estate president <unk> <unk> \r\n rockefeller may well have found its match in mitsubishi estate a company of long history strong government ties and sound resources \r\n in asset terms mitsubishi estate is the largest real estate firm in japan \r\n the core of its holdings is N square <unk> of <unk> expensive property in the <unk> district the business and financial center of tokyo often <unk> called mitsubishi village \r\n the mitsubishi family company acquired that property from the government some N years ago when it was a portion of <unk> residential land running from the <unk> of the imperial palace east toward the <unk> of tiny shops and <unk> <unk> that made up the merchants ' district \r\n at the time japan had just opened its doors to the world after about N years of <unk> and needed a western-style business center \r\n mitsubishi built the government 's dream development the story goes in exchange for the official decision to <unk> tokyo 's central railway station there \r\n that was just an early step in a relationship with government that has earned the mitsubishi group the dubious <unk> of <unk> literally <unk> a title that has the <unk> <unk> of doing the government 's bidding but also suggests the clout inherent in maintaining such close ties \r\n mitsubishi estate is one of the dozens of companies in today 's mitsubishi group \r\n it 's known for its <unk> in part because it has had little need for bold overseas ventures in the year ended march N N N of its total revenue came from office building management \r\n its earnings can rise N N to N N annually simply from the natural turnover of tenants and automatic rent increases says <unk> mcdonald an industry analyst at james capel pacific ltd \r\n for the latest fiscal year the company 's net income jumped a robust N N to N billion yen $ N million \r\n for mitsubishi estate the rockefeller purchase will <unk> it firmly into the overseas real estate business the one area where it has lagged notably behind japanese competitors such as mitsui which had purchased the exxon building \r\n japanese companies need to invest in overseas real estate for diversification says <unk> <unk> an industry analyst at goldman sachs japan corp \r\n rockefeller is n't the first overseas purchase for mitsubishi estate it has already played a leading role in designing los angeles 's citicorp plaza \r\n but the rockefeller investment is its largest \r\n nonetheless it will barely make a <unk> in mitsubishi estate 's finances analysts say \r\n mitsubishi estate has n't decided how it will raise the funds for the purchase which are due in cash next april but the <unk> holdings alone are estimated to have a market value of as much as N trillion yen to N trillion yen \r\n moreover as a member of the mitsubishi group which is headed by one of japan 's largest banks it is sure to win a favorable loan \r\n analysts say the company also could easily issue new convertible bonds or warrants \r\n meanwhile at home mitsubishi has control of some major projects \r\n it is the largest private-sector <unk> of the <unk> N project a <unk> development in the port city of <unk> about an hour outside tokyo \r\n the project is one of a select group of public projects opened to u.s. firms under a <unk> construction trade agreement reached last year \r\n the centerpiece of that complex the landmark tower will be japan 's <unk> building when it is completed in N \r\n mitsubishi is also pushing ahead with a controversial plan to <unk> <unk> into a business center of high-tech buildings a project <unk> for N years and six trillion yen \r\n time warner inc. and sony corp. may be today 's public enemies but the two entertainment giants could end up becoming partners in a number of ventures as part of a settlement of their <unk> legal dispute over hollywood producers peter guber and jon peters \r\n the warner bros. studio and sony signaled they are close to a settlement yesterday asking a los angeles superior court to postpone a hearing scheduled for tomorrow on warner 's request for a preliminary injunction blocking mr. guber and mr. peters from taking the top posts at columbia pictures entertainment inc \r\n in separate statements the two sides said they want to have further discussions \r\n sony is acquiring columbia and guber-peters entertainment co. in two separate transactions valued at more than $ N billion \r\n warner communications inc. which is being acquired by time warner has filed a $ N billion <unk> suit against sony and the two producers \r\n warner has a five-year exclusive contract with mr. guber and mr. peters that requires them to make movies exclusively at the warner bros. studio \r\n the two sides in the legal battle have <unk> accusations of <unk> at each other for weeks and both warner and sony have accused each other of trying to sabotage each other 's prospects for success in the entertainment business \r\n but it may amount to little more than <unk> the two have continued <unk> <unk> settlement talks over the last few weeks and people familiar with the talks say the matter could be resolved within a week \r\n both warner and sony declined to comment on the terms of the settlement discussions \r\n but the people familiar with the talks said that warner is n't expected to get any cash in the settlement \r\n instead sony is likely to agree to let warner participate in certain of its businesses such as the record club of sony 's cbs records unit \r\n warner has <unk> sony as the largest record company but it does n't have a powerful world-wide record club like cbs \r\n the two sides are also discussing certain business ventures involving cable rights to columbia 's movies \r\n in addition sony is expected to agree to swap columbia 's N N stake in the <unk> <unk> calif. studio that warner and columbia share in exchange for the old mgm studio lot that warner acquired with the purchase of <unk> <unk> corp \r\n still it may be tough for the two to have a smooth partnership in anything in the wake of sworn affidavits filed over the last week \r\n one for example came from cbs records chairman walter yetnikoff who will head a committee that will oversee sony 's entertainment division including both records and movies \r\n in his affidavit mr. yetnikoff accused warner chairman steven j. ross of having an <unk> <unk> bias and said that mr. ross had tried to talk him out of letting sony buy cbs records two years ago for that reason \r\n mr. ross who will be chairman and co-chief executive officer of time warner after the merger is complete denied that in his own affidavit and called mr. yetnikoff 's remarks vicious and his claims reckless irresponsible and <unk> saying warner under his leadership has started a number of businesses in japan \r\n mr. ross also said he enjoys warm professional and personal relationships with japanese executives including sony chairman <unk> <unk> who has visited my home here \r\n but despite the <unk> between mr. ross and mr. yetnikoff officials of the time side of time warner have reportedly been increasingly interested in a settlement that might yield attractive business opportunities \r\n time executives such as the company 's president n.j nicholas who will eventually be co-chief executive of time warner alongside mr. ross have no personal relationships or <unk> at stake in the fight over the guber-peters duo and were never directly drawn into the fray \r\n talks between the two sides could <unk> of course as they have more than once since sony announced its plans to hire mr. guber and mr. peters \r\n but both sides appear to be more willing now to meet each other 's terms to resolve the issue \r\n and although warner has said it wanted the producers to fulfill the terms of their contract the producers said in sworn court <unk> that they did n't believe the relationship could be repaired after the <unk> of the legal battle \r\n any settlement is also expected to exclude mr. guber and mr. peters from any of the projects they were working on at warner \r\n the guber-peters duo have N projects in various stages of development and production at warner including <unk> of the <unk> and a bright <unk> lie \r\n but that does n't mean mr. guber and mr. peters might not eventually get their hands on some of their projects studios develop hundreds of movies but produce only N to N each year \r\n once a studio chooses not to actually make a movie that is in development producers are typically free to take it elsewhere \r\n mr. guber and mr. peters also almost certainly would n't be able to participate in future <unk> to batman the blockbuster hit they produced for warner \r\n but in acquiring guber-peters entertainment sony will actually get a piece of the profits from batman since the publicly held concern gets certain revenue from the movies mr. guber and mr. peters produce \r\n the two producers own a combined N N stake in guber-peters \r\n southern co.

and our action today will allow gulf power to avoid prolonged <unk> legal proceedings \r\n he did not say what effect if any the $ N fine would have on the company 's earnings \r\n mr. <unk> said yesterday 's plea by gulf power which came after months of negotiations was based on evidence that gulf power had set up an elaborate payment system through which it <unk> outside vendors primarily three florida advertising agencies for making illegal political contributions on its behalf \r\n the <unk> agency for example allegedly made contributions from N to N to various funds for political

<unk> to the american right \r\n but there may be less there than meets the eye \r\n mr. moon planned to convert millions of americans to his unique brand of <unk> in which he plays the role of old <unk> <unk> political messiah and then to make the u.s. part of a unified international <unk> \r\n his original strategy in itself a brilliant innovation for spreading a <unk> was to create new economic enterprises each time he wanted to extend and fund his various <unk> <unk> \r\n tax-exempt airport and <unk> <unk> were intended only to provide start-up funds \r\n more stable industries were to build an economically viable infrastructure for the moon movement in north america as they had in japan and south korea \r\n then he would move his movement to europe \r\n but that was not to be \r\n throughout the 1970s and early 1980s spokesmen for both the unification church and its opponents in the <unk> movement gave wildly <unk> membership figures \r\n their <unk> lives on \r\n it is still common to read in the press that the church has N or more full-time american members and N associates \r\n some estimates have gone as high as N members \r\n but internal church documents clearly show that at its <unk> heights as when it organized a spectacular yankee stadium <unk> rally in N there actually were only about N full-time unification church members in the u.s. \r\n mr. moon 's support for a <unk> richard nixon the <unk> scandal and his prison sentence for income-tax evasion did not help the church 's <unk> efforts \r\n <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> kept member turnover high \r\n that the membership number has even kept close to its N size is the result of the <unk> of the church \r\n many of the enthusiastic young <unk> of the nixon era who remained <unk> to father moon are now parents producing new members by <unk> rather than conversion \r\n the <unk> wealth of the unification church is another matter of <unk> \r\n yet these purchases can be misleading \r\n most were obtained with huge <unk> of church money from south korea and japan minimum cash <unk> and sizable mortgages \r\n those teams of young <unk> selling flowers peanuts or <unk> outright at traffic <unk> brought in somewhere near $ N million a year during the <unk> 1970s but those revenues were a <unk> compared to the costs of mr. moon 's <unk> international conferences speaking tours and <unk> land buys \r\n only his factories in japan and korea <unk> his <unk> at <unk> wages and producing everything from <unk> to <unk> to expensive marble <unk> kept the money flowing <unk> \r\n virginia commonwealth university sociologist david <unk> who more than any other researcher has <unk> into the complex world of <unk> finances has concluded that profitable operations in the u.s. have been the exceptions rather than the rule \r\n likewise journalists john burgess and michael <unk> of the washington post have estimated that at least $ N million was transferred from japan to the u.s. to deal with the church 's annual operating losses in this country \r\n mr. moon 's two <unk> u.s. newspapers illustrate the scope of this financial drain \r\n start-up costs for the washington times alone were close to $ N million and the total amount lost in this <unk> black hole was estimated at $ N million by N \r\n since then moon 's organization has <unk> a pair of high-quality glossy opinion magazines the world and i and insight which are a further drain \r\n insiders say that not even their editors know for sure how much these <unk> publications along with the newspapers have cost mr. moon \r\n many american <unk> businesses such as a $ N million factory to build fishing vessels are <unk> \r\n some components of the american church had their budgets cut in half last year and again this year \r\n the relatively small academic conferences that have attracted conservative guests and press scrutiny in recent years are much more narrowly targeted and <unk> than the <unk> <unk> in fancy digs and exotic <unk> of years past \r\n i attended several of these in the dual role as a <unk> of research findings as well as an investigator of my hosts \r\n mr. moon 's <unk> house eventually even published three of my <unk> books on <unk> and politics \r\n according to veteran watchers of <unk> affairs such as dr. j. gordon <unk> director of the institute for the study of american <unk> almost all operations are being drastically reduced as mr. moon now <unk> more on developing his empire in the far east \r\n everything one <unk> senior consultant to the unification church recently told me in an interview is going back to korea and japan \r\n europe had proved even less <unk> than north america \r\n european politicians were less reluctant to have their governments investigate and <unk> new <unk> \r\n so mr. moon is in retreat <unk> on the far east \r\n south korea and japan continue to be profitable \r\n moon 's <unk> industry conglomerate is now investing heavily in china where church accountants have high hopes of expanding and attracting <unk> even in the wake of the bloody massacre in <unk> square \r\n <unk> motors is one such investment \r\n according to senior consultants to the church mr. moon has successfully negotiated a joint venture with the chinese government to build an <unk> plant in

who argued that the provision was unnecessary because the bill already would give the department ample power to block <unk> deals \r\n for years a strict <unk> <unk> the staff meetings at nissan motor co. 's technical center in tokyo 's western <unk> \r\n employees wore <unk> <unk> listing not only their names but also their dates of hire \r\n no one could voice an opinion until everybody with more seniority had spoken first so younger employees often the most enthusiastic and innovative seldom spoke up at all \r\n but in N the <unk> and the do n't speak out of turn rule were abolished early steps in a cultural revolution still rolling on with all the <unk> of a freight train \r\n in recent years nissan has instituted <unk> work schedules and allowed employees to dress <unk> even in blue jeans \r\n a rule <unk> staffers to own competitors ' cars has been lifted and now many designers drive foreign cars to get useful ideas \r\n nissan 's <unk> corporate song filled with <unk> to mount fuji has been scrapped in favor of a <unk> tune sung by a popular japanese <unk> \r\n and in a japanese corporate first nissan recently opened the first <unk> company <unk> for single employees at the suburban tokyo technical center \r\n we had lots of internal debate about this one concedes <unk> <unk> a senior public-relations official \r\n but in the end top management decided to follow the voice of the younger generation \r\n this corporate glasnost is a big reason nissan after years of making lackluster cars and <unk> profits has <unk> up its rigid ways and now is riding a string of hits ranging from the <unk> <unk> sedan and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> sold only in japan \r\n the company 's turnaround is far from complete many crucial tests are just beginning \r\n but its surprising progress so far holds important <unk> for companies in trouble \r\n the big one a company 's culture ca n't be <unk> changed unless top management first admits that things have gone badly <unk> and then publicly leads the charge \r\n <unk> <unk> nissan 's executive vice president for finance helped set the tone in december N when the company was heading toward the first operating loss by a japanese auto maker since the nation 's postwar recovery \r\n this is a time of <unk> to discover what is wrong with us he said \r\n <unk> kume who took the helm as nissan 's president in june N added simply i am deeply disappointed \r\n no wonder \r\n nissan japan 's second-largest auto maker and the world 's <unk> was getting beat up not only by its bigger rival toyota motor corp. but also by honda motor co. the most successful japanese car company in the u.s. but a relative <unk> in japan \r\n nissan 's market share in japan had been dropping year by year since the beginning of the decade \r\n its u.s. sales sagged partly because of price increases due to the rising yen \r\n worst of all nissan was <unk> with management <unk> <unk> and corporate <unk> \r\n consider the experience of <unk> <unk> a <unk> designer of vehicle <unk> who joined nissan in N \r\n at that time tasks were assigned strictly on the basis of seniority \r\n the oldest designer got to work on the <unk> she recalls \r\n the next level down did doors \r\n if a new person got to work on part of the <unk> that was a big deal \r\n this system produced boring <unk> cars that consumers just were n't buying \r\n desperately hoping to spark sales nissan transferred N middle managers and plant workers to dealerships \r\n meanwhile president kume ordered everyone from top executives to <unk> designers to go town watching to visit <unk> parts of tokyo to try to gain <unk> into developing cars for <unk> \r\n some <unk> <unk> were downright comic \r\n one group of <unk> manufacturing men from the company 's <unk> plant outside tokyo was supposed to check out a trendy restaurant in the city \r\n but when they arrived at the door all were afraid to go in <unk> that they would be out of place \r\n other trips were more productive \r\n mr. kume himself visited honda 's headquarters in tokyo 's upscale <unk> district \r\n he liked the <unk> lobby display of honda 's cars and trucks so much that he had nissan 's gloomy lobby exhibit <unk> \r\n later nissan borrowed other honda practices including an engineering idea contest to promote <unk> \r\n one engineer developed a <unk> car that moves <unk> \r\n such sudden cultural shifts may come across as a bit forced but they seem to be genuine so much so in fact that some older employees have resisted \r\n nissan handled the <unk> in a typically japanese fashion they were n't fired but instead were neglected says <unk> <unk> the personnel manager at the nissan technical center \r\n despite the pain of adjusting the cultural revolution has begun to yield exciting cars \r\n a year ago the company completely revamped its <unk> sedan the $ N <unk> which competes against a broad range of upscale <unk> it replaced its <unk> <unk> body with <unk> <unk> lines \r\n since then nissan also has launched new versions of the $ N <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> sports car \r\n the <unk> <unk> costs as much as $ N and is <unk> off against the <unk> N which begins at $ N \r\n besides new <unk> the new <unk> have more powerful engines and more sophisticated suspension systems \r\n all three new models are <unk> their <unk> by wide margins \r\n in its home market nissan has grabbed attention with <unk> <unk> featuring <unk> odd enough to be <unk> \r\n one is the <unk> a tiny <unk> with a <unk> <unk> top and <unk> <unk> that give it a <unk> look \r\n nissan initially planned to sell just N <unk> but sales have passed N and there 's a one-year waiting list for the car \r\n then there 's the <unk> an <unk> delivery van with a <unk> body that inspired its name \r\n nissan helped develop a tokyo restaurant with both vehicles as its design theme \r\n the chairs are <unk> seats and a gift shop sells such items as alarm <unk> <unk> like the <unk> 's <unk> <unk> \r\n all these vehicles have sharply improved nissan 's morale and image but have n't done much for its market share \r\n nissan had N N of the japanese car market in N before beginning a <unk> <unk> slide that continued through last year \r\n strong sales so far this year are certain to turn the tide but even the N N market share that nissan expects in N will leave it far below its position at the beginning of the decade \r\n nissan concedes that it wo n't recoup all its market-share losses in japan until at least N and even that timetable might prove optimistic \r\n everyone else is going to catch up with nissan 's innovative designs says a. <unk> <unk> auto analyst at first boston japan ltd \r\n nissan 's pace of <unk> hits will slow he adds just as <unk> toyota <unk> its own batch of new cars \r\n likewise in the u.s. nissan has grabbed N N of the car market so far this year up from N N a year ago \r\n but even that brings nissan only to the share it had in N and leaves the company behind its high of N N in N and N \r\n why \r\n so far nissan 's <unk> successes are mostly specialized vehicles with limited sales potential \r\n in compact and <unk> cars the bread-and-butter sales <unk> for japanese auto makers nissan still trails toyota and honda \r\n nissan hopes that that will start to change this fall with its new version of the stanza compact sedan \r\n the stanza has been a <unk> compared with honda 's <unk> successful accord and toyota 's <unk> \r\n but this year honda has revamped the accord and made it a midsized car \r\n nissan instead has kept its new stanza a bit smaller than that and cut the base price N N at $ N stanza prices start $ N below the predecessor model yet have a <unk> engine \r\n accord prices start at $ N \r\n nissan 's risk is that its <unk> strategy might get lost amid the highly publicized rebates being offered by detroit 's big three \r\n but on a new car a <unk> does n't work well because it <unk> the vehicle 's image contends thomas d. <unk> executive vice president of nissan 's u.s. sales arm \r\n even if the new stanza succeeds nissan will remain behind in the <unk> segment where its <unk> does n't measure up to the honda civic and toyota <unk> \r\n nissan will introduce a completely revamped <unk> next fall \r\n at the opposite end of the market nissan <unk> its luxury infiniti division on nov. N three years after honda <unk> japanese luxury cars and two months after toyota 's lexus went on sale \r\n nissan started advertising infiniti fully eight months before the cars hit american <unk> \r\n the ads featured <unk> rocks and <unk> <unk> almost anything but the cars themselves \r\n the ads have generated some <unk> but also plenty of attention because they are so unlike any other u.s. auto advertising \r\n on the other hand nissan 's sales goals for infiniti are modest compared with toyota 's targets for lexus \r\n nissan will build only about N of the $ N infiniti <unk> <unk> each month sending about N of them to the u.s. and keeping the rest for sale in japan \r\n toyota wants to sell about N lexus <unk> <unk> next year in the u.s. alone \r\n when i saw the lexus sales projections i got worried <unk> <unk> <unk> who led the infiniti development team \r\n but on reflection mr. <unk> says he concluded that nissan is being prudent in following its <unk> strategy instead of simply copying lexus \r\n infiniti is nissan 's big business move for the <unk> century and we 're in no hurry to generate large profits right away mr. <unk> says \r\n despite plans to add two new infiniti models next year bringing the total to four infiniti wo n't show profits for at least five years he adds \r\n these days nissan can afford that strategy even though profits are n't exactly robust \r\n nissan had record net income of N billion yen $ N million in the fiscal year ended last march N a remarkable recovery from the N billion yen of two years earlier when the company lost money on operations \r\n nissan has increased earnings more than market share by cutting costs and by taking advantage of a general surge in japanese car sales \r\n but nissan expects to earn only N billion yen in the current fiscal year a modest increase of N N \r\n the big reason for all its cost-cutting nissan remains less efficient than toyota \r\n in its last fiscal year nissan 's profit represented just N N of sales compared with N N at toyota \r\n to help close the gap nissan recently established a <unk> cost-cutting committee \r\n nissan is the world 's only auto maker currently building vehicles in all three of the world 's key economic <unk> the u.s. japan and europe \r\n that gives it an <unk> strategic advantage at least until its rivals catch up but also plenty of <unk> headaches \r\n for example nissan 's u.s. operations include N separate subsidiaries for manufacturing sales design research etc. that report separately back to japan \r\n and in july nissan 's tennessee manufacturing plant beat back a united auto workers organizing effort with aggressive tactics that have left some workers bitter \r\n we are in a <unk> phase from being a japanese company to becoming an international company based in japan says mr. <unk> the executive vice president \r\n he promises that nissan will soon establish a holding company overseeing all u.s. operations just as it 's doing in europe \r\n perhaps the biggest challenge however will be to prevent a return to its former corporate <unk> as its recovery continues \r\n already personnel officials are talking about the need for a phase two <unk> effort of some sort \r\n we are still only half way through the turnaround of this company and there are many more things to do president kume says \r\n he adds however that the momentum we have generated is <unk> \r\n as expected warner <unk> records said it agreed to form a <unk> and <unk> joint venture with former mca records chairman irving azoff \r\n warner said it will provide financing for the venture but did n't disclose terms \r\n mr. azoff has n't named the company yet but any records it produces will be distributed by warner \r\n warner is part of warner communications inc. which is in the process of being acquired by time warner inc \r\n mr. azoff resigned as head of mca records a unit of mca inc. in september and had been discussing a joint venture with both warner and mca \r\n in a statement yesterday mr. azoff said he chose warner the largest record company because their standing in the entertainment industry is second to none \r\n president bush and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev will hold an informal meeting in early december a move that should give both leaders a political boost at home \r\n the white house is <unk> not calling the meeting a summit so that there wo n't be any expectation of detailed negotiations or agreements \r\n rather senior administration officials said that the unexpected meeting was scheduled at mr. bush 's request because of his preference for conducting <unk> through highly personal and informal meetings with other leaders \r\n the two leaders will meet on dec. N and N <unk> the two days of meetings between a u.s. and a soviet naval vessel in the <unk> sea \r\n the unusual <unk> meeting wo n't disrupt plans for a formal summit meeting next spring or summer at which an arms-control treaty is likely to be completed \r\n in announcing the meeting yesterday mr. bush told reporters at the white house that neither he nor mr. gorbachev expects any substantial decisions or agreements \r\n instead he said that the purpose is simply for the two to get better <unk> and discuss a wide range of issues without a formal agenda \r\n despite the informal nature of the session and the calculated effort to hold down expectations the meeting could pay significant political dividends for both leaders \r\n mr. gorbachev badly needs a diversion from the serious economic problems and ethnic unrest he faces at home \r\n american officials have said that a meeting with the leader of the u.s. could help bolster his <unk> among soviet politicians and <unk> whose support he needs \r\n for his part mr. bush has been criticized regularly at home for moving too slowly and cautiously in reacting to mr. gorbachev 's reforms and the historic moves away from communism in eastern europe \r\n a face-to-face meeting with mr. gorbachev should damp such criticism though it will hardly eliminate it \r\n senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine who has been the most prominent democratic critic of mr. bush 's handling of the soviet relationship praised the president for arranging the meeting \r\n but he added the mere fact of a meeting does n't deal with the substance of policy \r\n mr. bush said that the december meeting which was announced simultaneously in moscow will be held in the unusual setting of ships at sea to hold down the fanfare and force the two sides to limit participation to just small groups of advisers \r\n by doing it in this manner we can have i would say more time without the press of social activities or mandatory joint appearances things of that nature for public consumption mr. bush said \r\n soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze at a news conference in moscow said as the two sides plan to hold a <unk> summit in late <unk> summer next year they found it useful i would say even necessary to hold an interim informal meeting \r\n although no specific agreements are expected mr. shevardnadze said that does n't mean they will be without an agenda \r\n if the two leaders cover the subjects that have been featured in lower level u.s.-soviet meetings their talks would include human rights soviet reforms regional disputes relations with allies economic cooperation arms control and joint efforts to fight narcotics terrorism and pollution \r\n the president specifically mentioned u.s. economic advice to moscow as a possible topic \r\n mr. gorbachev has for months been publicly urging the u.s. to drop its restrictions on soviet trade \r\n he recently told a small group of american businessmen in moscow that he hoped to sign a general trade agreement with the u.s. possibly at the N summit \r\n the soviets hope a trade agreement would give them <unk> nation status which would lower the tariffs on soviet exports to the u.s. \r\n in an unusually <unk> article about the latest economic <unk> unemployment pravda yesterday reported that three million soviets have lost their jobs as a result of perestroika and the number could grow to N million by the year N \r\n economists in moscow are now proposing that the state start a system of unemployment benefits \r\n but one bush administration official knowledgeable about the summit plan cautioned against assuming that there will be bold new initiatives on the soviet economy or other issues \r\n do n't take this as some big opening for major movement on economic cooperation or arms control or the environment he said \r\n those things will all come up but in a fairly informal way \r\n instead this official said this is vintage george bush \r\n this was george bush 's own idea \r\n it 's george bush wanting to meet a foreign leader and talk to him directly \r\n aside from the soviet economic plight and talks on cutting strategic and chemical arms one other issue the soviets are likely to want to raise is naval force reductions \r\n western analysts say that given the meeting 's setting at sea gorbachev is unlikely to pass up the opportunity to press once again for negotiated cuts in the <unk> of both the north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact \r\n that theme has been a <unk> one for soviet military officials for much of this year \r\n they argue that as the kremlin follows through on announced plans to cut land forces the soviets ' area of greatest strength the u.s. should show more willingness to cut sea forces washington 's area of greatest <unk> \r\n one of the reasons bush administration aides are anxious to insist that the coming meeting will be informal is to avoid comparisons with the last such <unk> structured <unk> gathering former president reagan 's N meeting with mr. gorbachev in <unk> <unk> \r\n that meeting sent <unk> through the western alliance because mr. reagan was pulled into discussing the possible elimination of nuclear weapons without consulting american allies \r\n mr. bush said that he initiated talks with the soviets on the informal meeting by sending a proposal to mr. gorbachev last july which the soviet leader readily accepted \r\n but word of the possible session was closely held by the president and a handful of top aides and word of it did n't reach many <unk> officials until the past few days \r\n indeed many senior officials had been insisting for weeks that mr. bush was n't interested in such an informal <unk> \r\n though president bush 's political critics at home have been urging him to open a more direct dialogue with mr. gorbachev it actually was the arguments of leaders within the soviet bloc itself that led the president to seek the december meeting \r\n mr. bush decided he wanted the meeting after talking in europe in july with the leaders of poland and hungary who urged him to support mr. gorbachev 's efforts to transform the soviet system and to urge him to loosen his grip on eastern europe a senior aide said \r\n while flying home from those discussions mr. bush drafted a letter to mr. gorbachev suggesting an informal <unk> to <unk> their formal summit next year \r\n peter <unk> in moscow contributed to this article \r\n <unk> <unk> del <unk> said its potential losses from lending to <unk> could reach N trillion lire $ N million marking the bank 's first <unk> of potential costs of unauthorized lending by its atlanta branch \r\n bnl previously reported that its georgia branch had taken on loan commitments <unk> $ N billion without the <unk> management 's approval \r\n state-owned bnl italy 's largest bank has filed charges against the branch 's former manager christopher <unk> and a former branch vice president alleging fraud and breach of their fiduciary duties \r\n bnl also said that its board had approved after an <unk> discussion a letter to the bank of italy <unk> measures the state-owned bank has taken or plans to take to improve controls on its foreign branches \r\n the central bank had ordered bnl to come up with a suitable program by yesterday \r\n bank of italy has also ordered bnl to shore up its capital base to account for potential foreign loan losses and the rome bank has outlined a N trillion lire <unk> operation \r\n bnl was unable to elaborate on what measures were planned by the bank to improve controls on its branches abroad \r\n hardly a day passes without news photos of the police dragging <unk> protesters from some building or <unk> in one of our cities \r\n of recent note are the activities of the <unk> and anti-abortionists anti-nuclear activists animal rights protesters college students concerned about <unk> <unk> groups various <unk> environmentalists and those <unk> with the pace of the war against aids \r\n maybe he did n't start it but <unk> gandhi certainly provided a <unk> beginning to non-violent civil disobedience as we know it today \r\n the <unk> or great <unk> one <unk> several campaigns of passive resistance against the british government in india \r\n unfortunately according to webster 's <unk> <unk> his policies went beyond his control and resulted in <unk> and <unk> and later a renewed campaign of civil disobedience resulted in <unk> and a second <unk> \r\n i am not a <unk> of everything gandhi did but some of his law breaking was justified because india was then under <unk> by a foreign power and indians were not able to participate fully in decisions that <unk> affected them \r\n it is difficult however to justify civil disobedience non-violent or not where citizens have full <unk> to the ballot box to effect change \r\n where truly representative governments are <unk> by constitutional <unk> of human rights and an independent judiciary to <unk> those rights there is no excuse for breaking the law because some individual or group <unk> with it \r\n there may be a few cases where the law breaking is well <unk> and so completely <unk> of the rights of others that it is difficult to <unk> it \r\n the case of <unk> parks the black woman who refused to sit at the back of the bus comes to mind as an illustration \r\n but most cases of non-violent civil disobedience are not nearly so benign \r\n the public has a tendency to <unk> <unk> demonstrations with non-violent civil disobedience \r\n it is true that both are non-violent but there is a fundamental difference between them \r\n <unk> demonstrations such as peaceful <unk> and other <unk> that do not <unk> the peace or cause a public <unk> or interfere with the rights of others are rights guaranteed by any truly free system of government \r\n civil disobedience violent or non-violent is <unk> law breaking \r\n the subject of this discussion is non-violent civil disobedience but before we get on with that let me make just a few <unk> remarks about <unk> demonstrations \r\n they are useful to call public attention to <unk> but they have little value in <unk> anyone about the issues in dispute \r\n the <unk> of television in dramatic confrontation encourages <unk> of <unk> <unk> through <unk> <unk> gestures <unk> signs and other <unk> inspired tactics \r\n <unk> <unk> and an environment where compromise can begin are lost in a hostile posture <unk> by <unk> media interviews \r\n at best demonstrations are <unk> and <unk> <unk> at worst they can become the <unk> that lead to law breaking \r\n demonstrations are particularly apt to <unk> into criminal conduct when they leave the site of the <unk> and become mobile \r\n <unk> criminals and street people looking for excitement <unk> themselves like <unk> to the <unk> of the crowd and use the protest as an excuse for rock throwing auto <unk> <unk> window breaking <unk> <unk> picking and general <unk> \r\n soon the whole purpose of the demonstration is lost in <unk> mania \r\n there are better ways to promote a cause \r\n where non-violent civil disobedience is the centerpiece rather than a <unk> demonstration that may only attract crime it is difficult to justify \r\n some find no harm in the <unk> of trespass minor property destruction blocking traffic and the like \r\n they say these are small prices to pay for <unk> action for the <unk> cause \r\n the crimes may appear small but the prices can be huge \r\n here are two cases to illustrate \r\n assume a neighborhood demonstration to protest speeding on a certain road or a <unk> accident involving a police car \r\n the protesters lie down in the street blocking traffic and will not move until the authorities carry them away \r\n assume that someone caught in the <unk> has a heart attack \r\n there is no way to get an <unk> in quickly to move him to a hospital \r\n he dies \r\n the demonstration was non-violent and involved only a simple <unk> but its impact on that individual was violent and terminal \r\n assume that a tv network is airing a celebrity interview program with a live audience \r\n the politician appearing is highly controversial and has recently generated a good deal of <unk> amid certain groups \r\n in a planned protest against his appearance several members of the studio audience chain themselves in front of the tv cameras in such a way that the program can not continue \r\n the network must refund money to the advertisers and loses considerable revenue and prestige \r\n the demonstrators have been non-violent but the result of their <unk> has been to seriously <unk> the rights of others <unk> with their dispute \r\n it might be alleged that tv has done more than its share to <unk> and promote non-violent civil disobedience so the second situation <unk> above would be simply a case of <unk> coming home to <unk> \r\n or maybe the tv network would lose nothing \r\n <unk> or phil would probably pull up another camera and interview the <unk> protesters \r\n let us look for a moment at another type of non-violent civil disobedience that only <unk> other people indirectly yet does <unk> damage to the nation as a whole \r\n i am referring to those young men who chose to <unk> their country 's call to arms during the vietnam war and fled to canada or some other <unk> to avoid combat \r\n their <unk> acts of civil disobedience which they tried to hide under the <unk> of <unk> at a war they characterized as <unk> weakened the national fabric and threw additional burdens on those who served <unk> in that conflict \r\n even more at fault are those leaders in and out of government who urged and supported their <unk> thereby giving great help and comfort to the enemy <unk> \r\n it is amazing that the <unk> mass executions in vietnam and cambodia do not weight more heavily on minds so morally <unk> \r\n worse it remained to a <unk> but <unk> president of the united states to <unk> the final <unk> upon those who fought and died in vietnam \r\n under the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> of the nation president carter <unk> thousands of draft <unk> thus giving dignity to their allegations of the war 's <unk> \r\n the precedent having been set who can complain if future generations called upon to defend the u.s. yield to the temptation to avoid the danger of combat by simply declaring the war <unk> and <unk> until it is over \r\n finally i think it important to point out the extraordinarily high <unk> of non-violent civil disobedience in these days of intensive media coverage \r\n give television a chance to cover live any breaking of the law and no second invitation will be required \r\n this brings into question the <unk> of those who lead civil disobedience demonstrations \r\n do they want the <unk> for themselves or for their cause \r\n here is a good rule of <unk> if the movement produced the leader the chance that he is <unk> is much greater than if the leader produced the movement \r\n in either case ask yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by watching the act of civil disobedience \r\n if you have not it is probable that a <unk> airing of the dispute by calm and rational debate would have been the better course \r\n mr. <unk> was vice president of the u.s. from N until he resigned in N \r\n gov. george deukmejian and key legislators agreed to back a temporary <unk> increase in the state sales tax to raise $ N million for repairs and relief associated with last month 's earthquake \r\n the tax increase which will be considered at a special session of the state legislature that begins tomorrow would cover only part of the estimated $ N billion to $ N billion in total damage caused by the oct. N quake \r\n aside from as much as $ N billion in recently approved federal aid the state is expected to draw from a gubernatorial emergency fund that currently stands at an estimated $ N million \r\n i am not aware that there is anything but bipartisan agreement for the general <unk> of the <unk> plan said a spokesman for the governor after a monday meeting with legislative leaders over the <unk> question \r\n the tax increase on top of the current <unk> per dollar sales tax would become effective this dec. N and expire dec. N N \r\n the <unk> plan was preferred over an alternative that would have boosted the state gasoline tax \r\n some legislators expressed concern that a <unk> increase would take too long and possibly damage chances of a major <unk> ballot initiative that voters will consider next june \r\n despite continuing problems in its newsprint business <unk> corp. posted a N N gain in third-quarter net income \r\n the consumer-products and newsprint company said net rose to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share a year ago \r\n sales rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion \r\n after a flat second quarter tied largely to lower newsprint earnings <unk> attributed the gain to improved results in its consumer businesses in north america brazil and korea \r\n those gains came from higher prices particularly for disposable <unk> and tissue products and from increased sales primarily for <unk> products the company said \r\n newsprint results continued to be depressed the company added because of industrywide price discounting \r\n the <unk> comparison was also enhanced by charges taken in the year-earlier period including $ N million related to the modernization of a pulp and newsprint mill in alabama \r\n in the N period also interest expense and tax rates were lower than a year ago \r\n in the first nine months profit rose N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share \r\n sales rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion \r\n in new york stock exchange composite trading <unk> closed at $ N a share up $ N \r\n intensive audits are coming to N taxpayers as research guinea pigs \r\n this is the year <unk> <unk> of N personal returns are being picked <unk> for <unk> audits to help the irs update its criteria for enforcement audit selection and use of resources \r\n the last taxpayer compliance measurement program survey covered N returns \r\n the <unk> project starts jan.

were satisfied with it \r\n courts have ruled that taxpayers must submit to <unk> audits but the irs will excuse from the <unk> <unk> anyone who was <unk> without change for either N or N \r\n rewards

that <unk> both the carrier 's chapter N petition and its N acquisition by texas air \r\n all eastern 's previous court efforts to head off the pilots ' demands have failed \r\n an eastern spokesman said he does n't expect that the arbitrator 's ruling will have any overall material effect on the company 's strategic plan \r\n bankruptcy experts said the law is n't clear on how such an arbitration ruling can affect a company 's case \r\n like any other creditor the pilots will have to apply to the court for payment of their claim \r\n that may leave a lot of <unk> for u.s. bankruptcy judge burton r. <unk> to decide what if anything the pilots actually collect \r\n in august he issued the ruling that let the pilots pursue their <unk> <unk> before the arbitrator \r\n the

obligation is totally unwarranted the statement said \r\n james <unk> a lawyer for the air line pilots association said the pilots were extremely pleased \r\n this is a blow not only to eastern but to the creditors committee he said \r\n eastern 's creditors committee along with the company has consistently opposed the pilots ' claim which if paid would have to come out of money both hope to use to pay off other bankruptcy claims \r\n eastern and its creditors are in the final delicate stages of negotiating a second reorganization plan to pay off the airline 's debts \r\n an earlier plan which had received the creditors ' approval in july fell apart when eastern changed its business plan \r\n it is n't known whether the pilot claim was figured into either plan \r\n the dispute between eastern and its pilots is over a pay parity clause in the pilots ' contract \r\n the clause was part of an agreement in which pilots accepted a substantial pay cut as long as no other labor group got a raise \r\n shortly after texas air took control of eastern some machinists union supervisors received a N N pay raise \r\n the pilots argued that this triggered a pay raise for them \r\n eastern has disputed the claim but a federal district court an appeals court and now the arbitrator have all <unk> with the pilots \r\n the two sides do n't even agree about how much money is at issue \r\n the pilots put the amount as high as $ N million the company at $ N million \r\n another arbitrator is hearing another pay parity case between eastern and its pilots resulting from a similar set of circumstances involving a separate pay raise granted another union \r\n a decision on that case is n't expected before <unk> \r\n ironically many of the pilots involved have left eastern or are still

N and N at a <unk> meeting in <unk> mr. lee said the goal is to have a free and open world trading system \r\n an asian bloc is n't intended he said \r\n that 's not possible \r\n on <unk> relations i 'm encouraged \r\n i think the earlier <unk> notes struck by u.s. commerce secretary robert mosbacher and u.s. trade representative carla hills have been more <unk> \r\n i believe the u.s. is becoming more patient and <unk> he said \r\n it 's the total relationship that is important \r\n the total relationship as mr. lee sees it is the flow of dollars to the u.s. to fund the deficits the investments the japanese are making in the u.s. in order to satisfy american demand that american products consumed in america should be made as much as possible in america by americans with japanese technology and capital \r\n japan 's recent political turbulence mr. lee said may mean japan will slow market adjustments \r\n they 'll be more <unk> in <unk> their own voters like opening up more to agricultural imports from america hurting their farmers \r\n on u.s. military presence in asia asked if his offer to allow the american military to use facilities in singapore would help preserve america 's presence in the region at bases in the philippines he said what we have done is make it easier for the philippines to continue to host american bases without it being said they are <unk> of the <unk> and the only ones in asia or in southeast asia \r\n we are willing to share the political burden of being host to america an imperial power \r\n we think it is n't such a great burden that it carries no <unk> and we are prepared to do it \r\n on <unk> relations it 's such a <unk> relationship going back into history \r\n i really do not understand how it is that <unk> feel so <unk> involved in this father figure that they want to <unk> of and yet they need \r\n i just do n't understand it \r\n my relationships with the british are totally different \r\n they <unk> it over me \r\n they did me some good \r\n they did themselves even more good \r\n they let me down when the japanese came down during world war ii \r\n i do n't feel down or done in because i show british <unk> on my television network or read their books \r\n i mean it is a normal adult relationship \r\n but the <unk> and the americans when i talk to them there 's so much passion about filipino <unk> being diminished as a result of being <unk> upon by the americans and so on \r\n the <unk> <unk> tries to put on <unk> but we let it pass \r\n it 's just comic when they try to <unk> they 're still the master race \r\n mr. lee added that the <unk> are making it very difficult for the u.s. military presence to last beyond five or N years \r\n on military alternatives if the u.s. pulls back the soviets already are present \r\n i <unk> sooner or later the japanese would have to fill up a large part of the gap on the naval side \r\n maybe the chinese maybe even the indians \r\n on economic consequences of a diminished u.s. presence america is the only major power in recent history that has used its military might to sustain a system that enables all participants to equally benefit without her as the provider of the security taking royalties \r\n asked why so few nations seem to share his views of america he said many people see it that way \r\n but they have just taken it for granted \r\n on cambodia let 's assume that former <unk> leader prince <unk> <unk> does what the press wants him to do and joins up with <unk> <unk> leader <unk> sen \r\n is the trouble over \r\n can <unk> and <unk> sen knock off the khmer rouge still supported by china \r\n he ca n't \r\n what is the way forward \r\n to get the khmer rouge as part of a process for elections \r\n and when they lose then we can expect china to stop aid \r\n let 's put it <unk> \r\n the chinese can not be seen to have made use of the khmer rouge and then <unk> them \r\n ms. house is vice president of dow jones international group \r\n mr. <unk> is editor of the asian wall street journal \r\n everything looked good as <unk> walter levy and colleagues carefully cut away a woman 's <unk> tumor at the cleveland clinic in N \r\n using small electrical shocks applied to her feet they were able to monitor <unk> nerves \r\n the shocks generated <unk> <unk> that traveled via <unk> to brain and showed up clearly on a <unk> monitor indicating no damage to the delicate <unk> tissue \r\n then says dr. levy she <unk> up <unk> \r\n the damage was to her motor nerves which could n't be monitored along with the <unk> nerves he explains \r\n the tragedy he adds galvanized me to look for a way to prevent similar cases \r\n dr. levy 's answer may come with a new kind of magnetic brain probe a device that he and dozens of u.s. researchers are studying with great hope \r\n besides holding the promise of safer <unk> surgery the probe could improve the <unk> of brain and <unk> disorders such as strokes and multiple <unk> \r\n perhaps most exciting the device is <unk> open a window to the workings of the brain \r\n the probe which is <unk> <unk> and apparently <unk> employs strong magnetic fields to induce small <unk> of electricity within the brain \r\n if positioned over the brain 's <unk> area the hand-held <unk> generate <unk> <unk> that zip down motor nerves and <unk> <unk> making say a finger <unk> \r\n in principle they will enable doctors to check the body 's motor system the way an <unk> tests a home 's electrical circuits by running current through them \r\n until now we 've had no objective way of measuring motor function says keith <unk> a <unk> conducting clinical tests with the devices at boston 's massachusetts general hospital \r\n all we could do was tell a patient squeeze my fingers as hard as you can or raise your arm \r\n under the best circumstances such tests are <unk> when a patient is <unk> they do n't work at all \r\n magnetic brain <unk> started in the early <unk> when researchers produced <unk> of light in the <unk> field with <unk> \r\n in the 1960s <unk> clinic researchers developed magnetic devices to stimulate motor nerves in the hand and other <unk> \r\n but for brain tests the <unk> machines would have required patients to stand on their heads says <unk> <unk> a researcher at the university of california at san diego \r\n the field took off in N after scientists at britain 's <unk> university developed a handy compact <unk> for brain <unk> \r\n since then at least two commercial versions have been put on the u.s. market and an estimated N have been sold \r\n in august a chicago conference on such devices attracted more than N researchers who reported studies on everything from brain <unk> to physical therapy \r\n we do n't feel we can use the devices routinely in surgery yet but we 're getting close says dr. levy who is now with the university of pittsburgh \r\n a problem he adds is that <unk> brains are more <unk> to magnetic <unk> than <unk> ones \r\n the devices could help indicate when surgery would help says charles <unk> a university of toronto <unk> \r\n for example <unk> <unk> victims occasionally have some intact <unk> <unk> that if <unk> by emergency surgery enable partial recovery \r\n but such operations typically are n't performed because there is no sign right after an injury that surgery would be beneficial \r\n the cost of magnetic stimulators would seem like peanuts if we could retrieve <unk> function in such people dr. <unk> says \r\n scientists caution there is a chance the <unk> technique might spark seizures in <unk> \r\n but no significant problems have been reported among hundreds of people tested with the devices \r\n the main <unk> besides feeling like a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> is like a <unk> on the head says sam <unk> a <unk> who has studied the brain stimulators at yale university \r\n one apparent side effect is a minor increase in a brain <unk> \r\n and some doctors who have conducted hours of tests on themselves report temporary headaches \r\n at least two companies <unk> laboratories inc. of <unk> wash. and <unk> medical systems inc. of <unk> conn. now sell versions of the magnetic devices \r\n the machines which at $ N are <unk> by medical standards have n't been approved in the u.s. for marketing as brain stimulators but are sold for <unk> nerves in the hand <unk> and other <unk> areas \r\n researchers can apply for permission to use the <unk> for brain studies \r\n at the university of kentucky a team led by dean <unk> a physical therapy researcher is testing the stimulators in <unk> with electric shocks to induce muscle <unk> to help prevent <unk> of <unk> <unk> after <unk> surgery \r\n similarly a <unk> university team led by heart researcher <unk> <unk> hopes to develop ways to <unk> induce <unk> muscle <unk> \r\n the devices might someday serve as temporary <unk> or <unk> for stopped hearts says dr. <unk> whose prototype was dubbed the <unk> <unk> \r\n the devices ' most remarkable possibilities though involve the brain \r\n probing with the stimulators national institutes of health scientists recently showed how the brain <unk> <unk> resources after an <unk> \r\n similar studies are expected to reveal how <unk> patients ' brains <unk> a first step toward finding ways to bolster that process and speed rehabilitation \r\n scientists also are exploring memory and perception with the new machines \r\n at the state university of new york at brooklyn researchers <unk> two groups of different letters on a computer screen in front of human guinea pigs \r\n between <unk> certain areas in subjects ' brains are jolted with a magnetic <unk> \r\n when the jolt is <unk> just right the subjects do n't recall seeing the first group of letters \r\n where does that first <unk> go <unk> <unk> <unk> paul <unk> \r\n trying to answer that is suggesting all kinds of theories such as precisely where and how the brain processes <unk> signals from the eyes \r\n he and others say that the machines are weak enough that they do n't jeopardize the memory \r\n both the <unk> team and researchers at the national <unk> laboratory in cambridge mass. are working with more potent magnetic brain stimulators \r\n among other things the stronger devices may be able to <unk> forth <unk> memories and induce mood changes <unk> say \r\n du pont co. hewlett-packard co. and los <unk> national laboratory said they signed a three-year $ N million agreement to <unk> on superconductor research \r\n the collaboration

N N economics minister helmut <unk> said \r\n he said the government will also repeal the N N transaction tax on the first-time purchase of stakes in companies \r\n the announcement follows several comments by government officials that the government will speed up the repeal of the tax which was originally scheduled to fall with the start of the single internal market in the european community at the end of N \r\n the <unk> tax has been long criticized by the west german financial community because it tends to drive securities trading and other banking activities out of frankfurt into rival financial centers especially london where trading transactions is n't taxed \r\n the tax has raised less than one billion marks $ N million annually in recent years but the government has been reluctant to abolish the levy for budgetary concerns \r\n in the interview mr. <unk> did n't specify the amount of revenue the government will lose after the tax disappears \r\n the new date means that the tax will be officially <unk> before the end of the current parliamentary term at the end of N and guarantees its <unk> even if the current <unk> coalition loses the elections in december N \r\n earlier this year president bush made a final <unk> it offer on the minimum wage an increase to $ N an hour over three years and only if accompanied by a lower wage for the first six months of a job \r\n now the white house has decided to accept the higher wage over only two years \r\n the <unk> wage would apply only to first-time <unk> workers for N days \r\n the white house had enough votes to sustain a veto but chose to avoid a confrontation \r\n the only permanent losers will be the N or so workers everyone agrees will be priced out of a job at the $ N rate congress is likely to approve today \r\n it is <unk> such as this that convince washington 's liberals that if they simply stay the course this administration will <unk> from its own course on this and other issues \r\n the head trader of chemical banking corp.

but one individual close to the situation said the resignation was forced \r\n mr. <unk> could n't be reached for comment \r\n a separate inquiry by chemical cleared mr. <unk> of allegations that he had been <unk> <unk> by a new york money broker \r\n that inquiry has n't resolved similar allegations involving another chemical options trader \r\n in other personnel changes stemming from problems in its options unit \r\n chemical named james kennedy a trader in swaps contracts for the bank to assume mr. <unk> 's duties and to be trading manager for derivative products including swaps and interest-rate options \r\n lee <unk> vice president in charge of options research who discovered the valuation errors and was asked by senior management to <unk> out the mess resigned to take a position in asset and liability management at continental bank in chicago \r\n mr. <unk> whom chemical tried to keep did n't return calls for comment \r\n separately chemical confirmed that it took an undisclosed charge in the second quarter for losses on <unk> agreements involving foreign currency written by its branch in frankfurt west germany \r\n a chemical spokeswoman said the second-quarter charge was not material and that no personnel changes were made as a result \r\n the spokeswoman said the frankfurt situation was totally different from problems in the interest-rate options unit \r\n according to individuals familiar with the situation the frankfurt loss stemmed from a computer program for <unk> prices on <unk> agreements that failed to <unk> an interest-rate environment where short-term rates were equal to or higher than long-term rates \r\n while the incidents involving interest-rate options and <unk> agreements are unrelated some observers say they echo a N incident in which bankers trust new york corp. restated the value of its foreign exchange options contracts downward by about $ N million \r\n these complex products require close monitoring because each must be valued separately in light of current market conditions \r\n in an interest-rate options contract a client pays a fee to a bank for <unk> protection against adverse interest-rate swings for a specified period \r\n in a <unk> agreement a client agrees to an exchange rate on a future currency transaction \r\n some competitors maintain the <unk> option loss in particular may have resulted more from chemical 's taking large and often <unk> positions than a valuation problem \r\n started three years ago chemical 's interest-rate options group was a leading force in the field \r\n from N to N the value of chemical 's option contracts outstanding <unk> to $ N billion from $ N billion \r\n more <unk> the volume of options written exceeded those purchased by almost <unk> \r\n with such a <unk> book of options traders say chemical was more vulnerable to <unk> valuation assumptions \r\n the chemical spokeswoman said the bank has examined its <unk> and internal controls \r\n we consider our internal controls to have worked well she said adding that some procedures have been strengthened \r\n its valuation <unk> she said are recognized as some of the best on the street \r\n not a lot was needed to be done \r\n when thomas w. wathen went big league last year he acquired a <unk> of <unk> along with a well-known but ailing security business pinkerton 's inc \r\n there was a wanted <unk> offering rewards for the arrest of express and train <unk> frank james and <unk> w. james and the original pinkerton 's <unk> with an open eye and the <unk> we never sleep which inspired the phrase private eye \r\n then there were two gold watches once owned by <unk> pinkerton who founded the company in chicago in N \r\n but there were supposed to be three mr. wathen 's company claims \r\n the missing watch is <unk> of the problems mr. wathen encountered in building his closely held california plant protection security service into the largest <unk> and security agency in the u.s. through acquisitions \r\n the <unk> mr. wathen has learned that while acquiring a big <unk> company can be a <unk> to growth it can also bring a host of <unk> problems \r\n we cleared out a lot of <unk> ' <unk> says the <unk> security veteran \r\n mr. wathen who started his career as an air force investigator and worked as a security officer for several large companies built his california plant protection from a tiny <unk> security <unk> firm here in the san fernando valley \r\n he joined the firm in N and bought it from the owners the next year \r\n over the next N years california plant protection opened N offices around the country \r\n yet although california plant protection was <unk> bigger and bigger clients the firm provided security for the N summer olympics in los angeles it still did n't have the name recognition of pinkerton 's \r\n so when american brands inc. decided to sell the unit in N as part of a divestiture of its food and security industries operations mr. wathen saw a chance to accomplish several objectives \r\n he decided he could easily merge pinkerton 's operations with his own while slashing overhead costs because the two already operated in many of the same cities \r\n he could acquire a staff of loyal pinkerton 's employees many of whom had spent their entire careers with the firm he could eliminate a competitor and he could get the name recognition he 'd wanted \r\n mr. wathen also <unk> the chance to demonstrate an entrepreneur like himself who 'd spent his whole career in the security business could run pinkerton 's better than an <unk> conglomerate or investment banker \r\n the security business is my favorite subject \r\n i love this business he says \r\n most of the lbo guys do n't know how to run a business anyway \r\n but there were <unk> not the least of which was that mr. wathen says he <unk> almost <unk> in doing the $ N million acquisition which was completed in january N \r\n we were n't allowed to do any due <unk> because of competitive reasons \r\n if we had it might have scared us off he says \r\n five years of rapid expansion under american brands with an emphasis on marketing the agency 's services instead of improving them had hurt pinkerton 's profits mr. wathen claims \r\n he says his team could n't tell whether accounts <unk> had been paid or not \r\n pinkerton 's had locked itself into <unk> contracts to win new business with no hope of profitability until the contracts expired he adds \r\n and regional offices were <unk> <unk> he claims \r\n one office had N people doing the work of three and half of the employees had company automobiles \r\n american brands declined to comment on mr. wathen 's accusations \r\n the acquisition combined the country 's second-largest security company pinkerton 's with N sales of $ N million and the fourth largest california plant protection with $ N million in sales creating the industry 's biggest firm which took on the pinkerton 's name \r\n even after <unk> itself of $ N million of unprofitable business the new pinkerton 's will have sales of about $ N million this year and operating profit roughly double the industry average of N N of sales says lloyd <unk> of <unk> & co. in los angeles which arranged the pinkerton 's acquisition \r\n mr. wathen says his turnaround strategy has been simple just <unk> away at the fat \r\n he began by closing N of the combined companies ' N offices in two months eliminating about N N of the company 's <unk> <unk> staff including more than N sales positions \r\n he shut down the company 's tony new york headquarters \r\n pinkerton 's world headquarters today is a <unk> <unk> office building across the street from the small van <unk> airport \r\n next mr. wathen raised pinkerton 's rates which were <unk> lower than california plant protection 's average rate of around $ N \r\n and he got rid of <unk> businesses that just were n't making money for the company \r\n mr. wathen who says pinkerton 's had a loss of nearly $ N million in N under american brands boasts that he 's made pinkerton 's profitable again \r\n but mr. wathen 's team still must pay down about $ N million of long-term bank debt from the acquisition within the next four years \r\n last year earnings of the combined companies did n't cover debt service and pinkerton 's was forced to borrow $ N million of subordinated debt \r\n we would n't have had to <unk> if a lot of the problems had n't been there mr. wathen says \r\n this year mr. wathen says the firm will be able to service debt and still turn a modest profit \r\n now pinkerton 's could become <unk> in a <unk> legal <unk> with its former parent \r\n the company recently filed suit in state court in los angeles against american brands seeking at least $ N million in damages from the old greenwich <unk> company \r\n the suit alleges that american brands <unk> the financial condition of pinkerton 's before the sale failed to disclose pending lawsuits and material contracts in which pinkerton 's was in default had n't registered the pinkerton 's name and trademark in the united kingdom and did n't tell california plant protection about some labor <unk> \r\n we have previously had discussions with representatives of pinkerton 's inc. concerning the sale of the company and we concluded that we did not have liability under the contract says american brands \r\n as this is now a litigation matter we have no further comment \r\n and then there 's the case of the missing gold watch \r\n the lawsuit alleges that an inventory of pinkerton 's <unk> disclosed that one of the watches had n't been <unk> over by american brands \r\n american brand 's failure to surrender the gold watch has damaged new pinkerton 's in an amount as yet to be determined and deprived it of a valuable <unk> for which it had <unk> the suit charges \r\n the key to pinkerton 's future will be sticking to what it does best being a security company says mr. wathen \r\n the company is also renewing its emphasis on investigations particularly <unk> investigations for corporations \r\n although investigations now account for only about N N of pinkerton 's total revenue that side of the business has traditionally been the more glamorous of the two and it carries historical and <unk> value \r\n author <unk> <unk> who wrote the <unk> falcon was a former pinkerton 's <unk> \r\n american brands just had a different approach mr. wathen says \r\n their approach did n't work mine is \r\n farm prices in october edged up N N from september as raw milk prices continued their rise the agriculture department said \r\n milk sold to the nation 's dairy plants and dealers averaged $ N for each hundred pounds up N cents from

subsidiary to a unit of ford motor co. for $ N billion \r\n paramount which agreed to sell the unit in july said it would realize net proceeds from the sale of $ N billion with an after-tax gain of $

its core container businesses \r\n for holders who decide not to tender their shares sea containers will issue one share of preferred stock with a stated value of $ N plus a cash dividend on the

N \r\n sea containers will soon set a date for its annual shareholder meeting to seek holder approval for the offer \r\n you 'd think all the stories about <unk> communities and developers getting hud grants would prompt congress to tighten up on upscale housing subsidies \r\n no way \r\n congress has just made it easier for the affluent to qualify for insured loans from the <unk> federal housing administration \r\n it appears that the only thing congress is learning from the hud story is how to <unk> its control of the <unk> pot going to special interests \r\n right now the largest loan the fha can insure in <unk> housing markets is $ N \r\n last week housing <unk> persuaded congress to raise the ceiling to $ N making fha loans more accessible to the <unk> \r\n but it does that at the cost of <unk> the taxpayer 's exposure if the fha is forced to pay for more loans going sour \r\n this is no idle fear last year the fha lost $ N billion in loan defaults \r\n but the higher mortgage ceiling is only the <unk> <unk> for what senator alan cranston and majority leader george mitchell have in mind for housing \r\n the senate banking committee will begin hearings next week on their proposal to expand existing federal housing programs \r\n other senators want to lower the down payments required on <unk> loans \r\n that would be a formula for ensuring even more fha red ink \r\n experience has shown that the most important element in predicting a <unk> default is the down payment \r\n because a <unk> can use an fha loan to finance all points and closing costs the fha can wind up lending more than a house is worth \r\n if housing prices continue to fall many borrowers would be better off walking away from their homes and leaving taxpayers with the losses \r\n much the same thing happened with <unk> s&ls a problem congress just solved with a $ N billion bailout \r\n we hear that hud secretary jack kemp is <unk> with going along with some of the <unk> proposals \r\n that sounds like a formula for ensuring that he gets dragged into the next hud <unk> pit \r\n a group of N senators has written mr. kemp urging him to reject <unk> and focus on programs that <unk> the poor rather than create vast new government obligations \r\n but even if he agrees mr. kemp does n't write the nation 's housing law congress does \r\n and the majority of members <unk> view the current <unk> of hud as mainly a chance to <unk> through their own slate of projects \r\n exhibit a is last week 's house vote to fund N pet projects out of the same discretionary fund that is at the heart of the hud scandal \r\n none of the grants had been requested by hud <unk> <unk> or were the subject of a single hearing \r\n more and more observers now realize that the key to ending future hud scandals lies in forcing congress to clean up its own act \r\n this week a baltimore sun editorial said the <unk> subcommittee on hud should forget about sam <unk> 's testimony for the moment and call some other witnesses the various congressional sponsors of the N pork-barrel projects \r\n the sun concluded that mr. <unk> is only part of the problem and a part that 's gone \r\n if hud is to be <unk> it concluded members of congress will have to start looking into and doing something about the practices of their colleagues \r\n of course <unk> is about the last thing this congress is interested in \r\n proponents of expanding fha programs say they merely want to help home buyers who are frozen out of high-priced markets \r\n but the fha program is hemorrhaging bad loans \r\n jack kemp has submitted a package of reforms and they are surely headed for the capitol hill <unk> \r\n like the s&l mess before it this is a problem congress should be solving not ignoring \r\n gillette

are calling for measures to control rising costs improve quality and provide care to the N million americans who currently lack health insurance \r\n agreement on these points is a long way from a specific program and nobody expects the u.s. to rush toward radical restructuring of the health-care system \r\n but there are signs that labor-management cooperation could change the politics of health-care legislation and the economics of medicine \r\n i ca n't remember a time when virtually everyone can agree on what the problem is says mr. seidman who heads the <unk> 's department dealing with health matters \r\n because the bush administration is n't taking the initiative on health issues business executives are dealing with congressional democrats who champion health-care revision \r\n business across the country is spending more time addressing this issue says sen. edward kennedy d. mass \r\n it 's a <unk> issue \r\n business complained earlier this year when sen. kennedy

's unsolicited $ N billion bid for great northern nekoosa corp. was hailed by wall street despite a cool reception by the target company \r\n william r. <unk> nekoosa 's chairman chief executive officer and president characterized the $ <unk> bid as <unk> and said nekoosa 's board would consider the offer in due course \r\n t. marshall hahn jr. georgia-pacific 's chairman and chief executive said in an interview that all terms of the offer are negotiable \r\n he added that he had spoken with mr. <unk> whom he referred to as a friend by telephone monday evening \r\n i 'm hopeful that we 'll have further discussions mr. hahn said \r\n on wall street takeover stock traders bid nekoosa 's stock well above the georgia-pacific bid assuming that nekoosa 's will either be sold to a rival bidder or to georgia-pacific at a higher price as much as $ N a share according to some estimates \r\n yesterday nekoosa common closed in composite new york stock exchange trading at $ N up $ N on volume of almost N million shares \r\n georgia-pacific closed down $ N at $ N in big board trading \r\n takeover stock traders noted that with the junk-bond market in disarray georgia-pacific 's bid is an indication of where the takeover game is headed namely industrial companies can continue bidding for one another but financial buyers such as leveraged buy-out firms will be at a disadvantage in obtaining financing \r\n the way the world is shaping up the strategic buyer is going to be the rule and the financial buyer is going to be the exception said one trader \r\n for the paper industry specifically most analysts said the deal will spur a wave of <unk> takeovers possibly involving such companies as union camp corp. federal <unk> co. and mead corp \r\n the analysts argued that georgia-pacific 's offer the first hostile bid ever among major players in the paper industry ends the <unk> <unk> on hostile bids and will push <unk> to look closely at the industry 's several attractive takeover candidates \r\n consolidation has been long overdue \r\n it was just the culture of the industry that kept it from happening \r\n the georgia-pacific offer has definitely changed the landscape said gary <unk> of oppenheimer & co \r\n added mark rogers of prudential-bache securities inc. it 's much easier to be second \r\n a georgia-pacific acquisition of nekoosa would create the largest u.s. forest-products company \r\n based on N sales georgia-pacific ranked third at $ N billion behind weyerhaeuser co. at $ N billion and international paper co. at $ N billion \r\n nekoosa ranked <unk> with sales of $ N billion \r\n the combined company would have had N sales of $ N billion \r\n but such a combination also presents great risks \r\n at a time when most analysts and industry consultants say pulp and paper prices are heading for a dive adding capacity and debt could squeeze georgia-pacific if the industry declines more than the company expects \r\n moreover any unexpected strengthening of the dollar would hurt georgia-pacific because two of nekoosa 's major product lines <unk> which is used to make shipping boxes and market pulp are exported in large quantities \r\n nobody knows how deep the cycle is going to be said rod young vice president of resource information systems inc. a <unk> mass. <unk> firm \r\n depending on how far down you go it may be difficult to pay off that debt \r\n one person familiar with georgia-pacific said the acquisition would more than double the company 's debt of almost $ N billion \r\n it also could be a drag on georgia-pacific earnings because the roughly $ N billion in goodwill the amount by which the bid exceeds nekoosa 's book value of $ N billion will have to be <unk> from earnings over a period of decades \r\n georgia-pacific 's mr. hahn said that a combined operation would allow savings in many ways \r\n the two companies each produce market pulp <unk> and white paper \r\n that means goods could be manufactured closer to customers saving shipping costs he said \r\n moreover production runs would be longer cutting <unk> from adjusting machinery between production cycles \r\n and georgia-pacific could save money in selling pulp because the company uses its own sales organization while nekoosa employs <unk> agents \r\n mr. hahn said georgia-pacific has accounted in its strategy for a significant downturn in the pulp and paper industry an event that he said would temporarily <unk> earnings \r\n but he said that even under those conditions the company still would realize a savings of tens of millions of dollars in the first year following a merger \r\n the fit is so good we see this as a time of opportunity he said \r\n georgia-pacific which has suspended its <unk> program would finance the acquisition with all bank debt provided by banks led by bankamerica corp \r\n georgia-pacific owns N nekoosa shares and would need federal antitrust clearance to buy more than $ N million worth \r\n u.s. clearance also is needed for the proposed acquisition \r\n for nekoosa defense options may be undercut somewhat by the <unk> state of the junk-bond market which limits how much value the target could reach in a <unk> recapitalization \r\n the company 's chairman mr. <unk> and a group of advisers met at the offices of <unk> lipton rosen & katz a law firm specializing in takeover defense \r\n nekoosa also is being advised by goldman sachs & co \r\n georgia-pacific 's advisers are <unk> <unk> & co. which stands to receive a $ N million fee if the takeover succeeds and the law firm of <unk> & sterling \r\n people familiar with nekoosa said its board is n't likely to meet before the week after next to respond to the bid \r\n the board has N business days to respond \r\n in addition to the usual array of defenses including a so-called poison pill and a <unk> board nekoosa has another takeover defense a maine state law barring hostile bidders from <unk> acquired businesses for five years \r\n nekoosa is incorporated in maine \r\n georgia-pacific has filed a lawsuit in federal court in maine challenging the poison pill and the maine merger law \r\n nekoosa 's poison pill allows shareholders to vote to <unk> it but georgia-pacific is n't likely to pursue such a course immediately because that would take N to N days and would n't affect the provisions of the maine law \r\n among companies mentioned by analysts as possible <unk> for nekoosa are international paper weyerhaeuser canadian pacific ltd. and macmillan <unk> ltd \r\n i 'm sure everybody else is putting pencil to paper said <unk> <unk> an analyst with first manhattan co \r\n international paper and weyerhaeuser declined to comment \r\n canadian pacific could n't be reached for comment and macmillan <unk> said it has n't any plans to make a bid for nekoosa \r\n investors were quick to spot other potential takeover candidates all of which have strong cash flows and low-cost operations \r\n among paper company stocks that rallied on the big board because of the offer were union camp up $ N to $ N federal <unk> up $ N to $ N mead up $ N to $ N and temple inland inc. up $ N to $ N \r\n in over-the-counter national trading <unk> inc. jumped $ N to $ N \r\n some analysts argued that there wo n't be a flurry of takeovers because the industry 's continuing <unk> program is eating up available cash \r\n moreover some analysts said they expect a foreign paper company with deeper pockets than georgia-pacific to end up acquiring nekoosa <unk> to the rest of the industry that hostile bids are <unk> \r\n this is a one-time event said lawrence ross of painewebber inc. referring to the georgia-pacific bid \r\n but many analysts believe that given the <unk> of paper companies ' cash flows as well as the <unk> consolidation of the paper industry in europe there will be at least a few more big hostile bids for u.s. companies within the next several months \r\n the buyers these analysts added could be either foreign or other u.s. concerns \r\n the georgia-pacific bid may open the door to a new era of consolidation in the paper industry said mark <unk> of shearson lehman hutton inc \r\n i do n't think anyone is now immune from takeover said robert <unk> of duff & phelps inc. chicago \r\n he added every paper company management has to be saying to itself before someone comes after me i 'm going to go after somebody \r\n prudential-bache 's mr. <unk> said he does n't see the industry 's <unk> program <unk> takeover activity \r\n several projects he said are still on the drawing board \r\n moreover it 's a lot cheaper and <unk> to buy a plant than to build one \r\n indeed a number of analysts said that japanese paper companies are <unk> to acquire additional manufacturing capacity anywhere in the world \r\n some predicted that nekoosa will end up being owned by a japanese company \r\n meanwhile shearson lehman 's mr. <unk> said that to stay competitive the u.s. paper industry needs to catch up with the european industry \r\n since the <unk> wave of friendly takeovers was completed in the u.s. in N there have been more than N mergers and acquisitions within the european paper industry he said \r\n <unk> inc. <unk> ill. and <unk> research inc. los angeles said the food and drug administration granted full marketing approval for a

buy-out \r\n great northern nekoosa soared $ N a share to $ N substantially above the $ N a share georgia-pacific is offering \r\n that indicates speculators are betting a higher offer is in the wings \r\n prices of other paper makers rose sharply although georgia-pacific fell $ N a share to $ N \r\n despite all the furor over program trading program trading played a big role in yesterday 's rally \r\n some traders point out that as the big brokerage firms back out of program trading for their own accounts or for clients opportunities increase for others to engage in the controversial practice \r\n that 's what happened yesterday \r\n the rally notwithstanding there are plenty of worries about the short-term course of stock prices \r\n a slowing economy and its effect on corporate earnings

february \r\n on a N roll call the house adopted the underlying transportation measure \r\n but the bill still faces budget questions because it also is the vehicle for an estimated $ N billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs \r\n the additional spending <unk> the measure more than $ N billion above its prescribed budget ceiling and the house appropriations committee leadership must now seek a waiver in hopes of completing action today \r\n the separate $ N billion bill sent to the white house had budget difficulties too but was saved ultimately by its importance to a broad spectrum of interests in congress and the administration itself \r\n no single bill this year includes more discretionary spending for domestic programs and apart from the space station the measure <unk> far-reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market \r\n the current ceiling on home loans insured by the federal housing administration is increased to $ N during fiscal N \r\n and in anticipation of increased lending the cap on fha loan guarantees would rise to approximately $ N billion \r\n separately the bill gives authority to the

provision met early and strong resistance from investment bankers worried about disruptions in their clients ' portfolios \r\n but the promise of at least $ N million in new savings helped to forge a partnership between hud secretary jack kemp and lawmakers wanting to protect their projects elsewhere \r\n the estimated $ N billion for the space station would be double last year 's level and total appropriations for the national aeronautics and space administration would grow N N to nearly $ N billion \r\n a string of costly projects including the <unk> national aerospace plane and the advanced communications technology satellite would continue to be developed within these limits \r\n and while imposing a statutory cap of $ N billion on future spending the bill would give nasa $ N million

and while pursuing these initiatives congress and the white house are squeezed too by steady increases $ N million in veteran 's medical care \r\n the result is that all sides resort to <unk> of hand to make room for competing housing and environmental programs and the commitments now will drive excess spending into fiscal N \r\n senior members of the house budget committee are reduced in frustration to raising doomed parliamentary obstacles to individual bills yet admit that much of the <unk> now stems from the fiscal <unk> associated with their own summit agreement with the white

eight communities in the western nebraska district of gop rep. virginia smith on the house appropriations committee \r\n <unk> express an independent airline serving much of nebraska estimates that nearly N N of its revenues come from the subsidies that in some cases exceed the cost of a ticket \r\n for example a passenger can fly from <unk> neb. to denver for as little as $ N to $ N according

the house action yesterday came as the senate remained mired in difficulties over a $ N billion measure covering the budgets for the state commerce and justice departments in fiscal N \r\n the compromise bill passed the house last week but has now provoked <unk> fights with the senate foreign relations committee which <unk> protects its prerogatives over operations at the state department \r\n the same <unk> can breed confusion however in the absence of any authorization bill this year \r\n house and senate <unk> sought to establish a nov. N deadline after which their bill would become the last word on how funds are distributed \r\n but on a N roll call this provision was stripped from the bill last night after foreign relations chairman <unk> <unk> d. <unk> complained that it was an <unk> on exclusive powers vested in his panel for more than three decades \r\n coda energy inc. said it arranged a $ N million credit facility with ncnb texas national bank a unit of ncnb corp. of charlotte n.c \r\n the dallas oil and gas concern said that $ N million of the facility would be used to consolidate the company 's $ N million of existing bank debt to repurchase N million of its N million shares outstanding of series d convertible preferred stock and to purchase a N N <unk> interest in certain oil and gas properties from one of its existing lenders national canada corp \r\n the remaining $ N million can be used over three years for oil and gas acquisitions the company said \r\n ted <unk> coda 's president said the loan carries an interest rate of prime plus one percentage point with N N of the company 's net oil and gas revenue each month dedicated to repayment \r\n the company put up virtually all of its oil and gas properties as collateral he said \r\n general dynamics corp. was given an $ N million air force contract for <unk> aircraft and related equipment \r\n loral corp.

fe pacific was the kind of story wall street loved \r\n since the value of its assets was n't known analysts were free to pick a number \r\n in one of many <unk> scenarios bear stearns 's gary <unk> wrote in march that its real estate alone had a value of $ N billion \r\n throw in its railroad minerals pipeline and oil assets he and others argued and the chicago-based conglomerate should be worth N a share \r\n and why should holders expect to realize that presumed worth \r\n that was another reason the street loved santa fe \r\n with real estate experts olympia & york and samuel <unk> 's itel owning close to N N of santa fe 's stock management was under pressure in a favored phrase of wall street to quickly maximize values \r\n but value it turns out is only what a buyer will pay \r\n and with the company 's recent announcement that it is contemplating a partial sale of its real estate the values suddenly look poorer \r\n santa fe has disclosed that it is negotiating to sell a N N interest in its real estate unit to the california public employees retirement system for roughly $ N million \r\n since the real estate unit also includes debt the <unk> value of the real estate itself is close to $ N billion \r\n the implied current net asset value of N per share is well below the N level that the street believed painewebber says \r\n the upside was in the <unk> real estate which is no longer an <unk> \r\n so what is santa fe worth \r\n if the railroad is valued on a private market basis at the same multiple of earnings as in the recent sale of cnw it would have a value of $ N billion \r\n a compromise between bulls and bears puts remaining assets and cash including its N N stake in its publicly traded pipeline at $ N billion \r\n santa fe also has $ N billion in debt \r\n in addition its railroad lost a $ N million antitrust suit which is on appeal and which analysts say could be settled for one-third that amount \r\n that <unk> out to about $ N a share for the company on a private market basis \r\n but santa fe currently trading at N N is n't likely to realize private market values by selling assets because the tax against it would be onerous \r\n its plan instead is to spin off the remainder of its real estate unit and to possibly do the same with its mining and energy assets \r\n robert d. <unk> santa fe 's chairman argues that since its businesses are valued in different ways the sum of the parts may be greater than the whole \r\n but it is n't clear why that should be so \r\n the spinoff argument after all <unk> the current notion that assets are worth more to private buyers than to public shareholders \r\n and real estate usually has n't traded well under public ownership \r\n salomon brothers says we believe the real estate properties would trade at a discount after the realty unit is spun off \r\n and what about the cost and risk of waiting to realize the hypothetical private market values \r\n some analysts remain bullish \r\n mr. <unk> of bear stearns says he is <unk> the worth of the company 's assets and in the meantime is sticking to his buy recommendation on the belief that he will find values of N a share \r\n he adds if for any reason i do n't have the values then i wo n't recommend it \r\n first boston 's <unk> anne <unk> values santa fe at N down from her earlier estimate of N \r\n her recent report <unk> the stock as a hold \r\n but it appears to be the sort of hold one makes while heading for the door \r\n <unk> from the report the stock 's narrow discount to asset valuation makes it a relatively <unk> investment at current prices especially given the risk that our projections could be on the aggressive side \r\n chairman <unk> says the california pension fund is getting a bargain price that would n't have been offered to others \r\n in other words the real estate has a higher value than the pending deal suggests \r\n since most of the unit 's real estate is in california the pension fund will be a useful political ally in a state where development is often held <unk> to <unk> boards \r\n and as mr. <unk> says with itel and <unk> on the unit 's board the real estate will be run by a very unusual group to say the least \r\n it is possible then that santa fe 's real estate even in a state <unk> by earthquakes could one day fetch a king 's <unk> \r\n but as drexel analyst linda dunn notes its properties will be developed over N to N years \r\n so despite wall street 's <unk> talk of quickly <unk> values holders could be in for a long wait \r\n santa fe pacific

from the thrift in salaries bonuses and proceeds from securities sales in the N N years before federal authorities seized it earlier this year \r\n lincoln 's collapse may cost taxpayers as much as $ N billion according to estimates making it the most expensive thrift failure in history \r\n i think there 's overwhelming evidence to indicate probable criminal activity said mr. <unk> who participated last year in an examination of the irvine calif. thrift \r\n he said the evidence pointed to wrongdoing by mr. keating and others although he did n't <unk> any specific violation \r\n richard <unk> a california state official who last year examined lincoln 's parent american continental corp. said he also saw evidence that crimes had been committed \r\n it sure <unk> like it he said \r\n he said N N of the loans he <unk> were dead meat on the day they were made \r\n the state examiner also said supervisors of a parallel federal examination seemed so reluctant to demand write-downs of lincoln 's bad loans that he immediately grew <unk> \r\n later on my concerns about a <unk> became even more serious he said \r\n he called the sour loans <unk> and added you opened the file up and it just jumped at you \r\n leonard <unk> a washington attorney for lincoln 's parent corporation said in an interview we deny any criminal behavior by the association or its officers \r\n those who testified yesterday have consistently maintained that anyone who did n't agree with them is part of a <unk> a <unk> or the subject of excessive influence mr. <unk> said \r\n we simply do n't agree with that or the findings of their investigation \r\n mr. wall 's deputies complained that they had n't been given an opportunity to respond to the criticism brought out during the banking committee 's hearings which committee chairman henry gonzalez d. texas has used as a forum to <unk> mr. wall 's handling of the affair and to demand that he step aside from his job \r\n a couple of things mr. <unk> said were at least misleading said kevin o'connell one of the washington regulators responsible for the handling of lincoln \r\n in an interview he said federal regulators eventually declared one of the loans the state regulator cited to be a total loss and forced lincoln to make an $ N million downward adjustment on another \r\n our response to the <unk> would simply be look what happened another washington official alvin <unk> said in an interview \r\n federal officials seized the association in april a day after the parent corporation entered bankruptcy-law proceedings \r\n the government later brought a $ N billion fraud suit against mr. keating and others \r\n rep. gonzalez has complained that regulators waited far too long however ignoring a recommendation from regional officials to place lincoln into <unk> two years before it failed \r\n he took the reckless course of ignoring the evidence rep. gonzalez said \r\n state thrift examiner eugene <unk> said he found the chief federal examiner steve scott to be totally <unk> in one allegedly fraudulent series of transactions \r\n frankly it was like he worked for the lincoln public-relations department mr.

spoken to his attorney who has advised him not to talk to anybody \r\n mr. <unk> said that a day or two before lincoln 's parent entered bankruptcy proceedings he and other <unk> saw a truck with a sign on it that said it was from the document destruction center \r\n we observed at least two large plastic bags of <unk> paper loaded into this truck \r\n mr. <unk> said the paper had been donated to a charitable organization that sells it for recycling \r\n they <unk> it simply because it contained financial information about their creditors and <unk> \r\n mr. <unk> said his <unk> were aroused by several foreign investments by lincoln including $ N million paid to credit suisse of switzerland an $ N million interest in saudi european bank in paris a $ N million investment in a <unk> trading company and a recently discovered holding in a <unk> company <unk> holdings \r\n mr. <unk> said i can see why an s&l examiner would regard these as unusual activities but said the overseas investments

\r\n the big questions are whether the increase effective jan.

firms that have n't pulled back from program trading in recent days \r\n mr. phelan is an <unk> diplomat who normally appears to be <unk> in control of the big board 's <unk> \r\n but he has been getting heat from all sides over program trading \r\n mr. phelan 's recent remarks that investors simply must get used to the stock-market volatility from program trading have drawn criticism from both the exchange 's stock specialists who make markets in individual stocks and from many companies that have shares listed on the big board \r\n mr. phelan said that his predicting continued volatility is just how the world is \r\n if bringing the message is a crime i 'm guilty of it \r\n but he said this does n't mean he is satisfied with the market 's big swings \r\n we 're trying to take care of a <unk> of a lot of constituents mr. phelan said \r\n each one has a different agenda \r\n for example in a special meeting monday with mr. phelan senior officials of some of the big board 's N stock specialist firms complained that the exchange is no longer representing their interests \r\n we are looking for representation we have n't had a specialist said \r\n we 've had <unk> \r\n after another session mr. phelan held yesterday with major brokerage firms such as morgan stanley & co. goldman sachs & co. painewebber group inc. and first boston all of which have engaged in program trading an executive of a top brokerage firm said clearly the firms want the exchange to take leadership \r\n many specialist firms <unk> the big board 's new basket product that allows institutions to buy or sell all stocks in the standard & poor 's 500-stock index in one shot \r\n ultimately the specialists view this as yet another step toward electronic trading that could eventually destroy their franchise \r\n his phelan 's own interests are in building an electronic marketplace said a market maker \r\n the basket product while it has got off to a slow start is being supported by some big brokerage firms another member of mr. phelan 's <unk> constituency \r\n mr. phelan has had difficulty convincing the public that the big board is serious about curbing volatility especially as the exchange clearly <unk> its role as the home for $ N billion in stock-index funds which buy huge baskets of stocks to mimic popular stock-market indexes like the standard & poor 's N and which sometimes employ program trading \r\n the big board wants to keep such index funds from <unk> to overseas markets but only as long as it handles it <unk> mr. phelan said \r\n despite what some investors are suggesting the big board is n't even considering a total ban on program trading or stock futures exchange officials said \r\n most revisions it will propose will be geared toward slowing down program trading during <unk> periods said officials working with the exchange \r\n computers have made trading more rapid but that can be fixed with some <unk> \r\n i think if you can speed things up you can slow them down mr. phelan said \r\n that 's different than <unk> them \r\n while volatility wo n't go away he said volatility is greater than program trading \r\n what i 'm trying to say to people is it 's proper to worry about program trading but it 's only a piece of the business \r\n for example mr. phelan said that big institutions have so much control over public investments that they can cause big swings in the market regardless of index arbitrage \r\n a lot of people would like to go back to N before program trading he said \r\n i would like to go back to N \r\n but we 're not going back to N \r\n indeed mr. phelan said that if stock-market volatility <unk> the u.s. may lose its edge as being the best place to raise capital \r\n japan 's markets are more stable he said \r\n if that continues a significant number of u.s. companies will go over there to raise money \r\n in coming days when the big board <unk> its responses to the program-trading problem mr. phelan may take a more public role in the issue \r\n lewis l. <unk> vice chairman of smith barney harris upham & co. said this is a problem that 's taking on a life of its own \r\n the program trading situation seems to have driven individual investors as well as others out of the market and even europeans are <unk> \r\n the exchange should take a <unk> position \r\n for now however mr. phelan said i refuse to get out there and tell everybody everything is <unk> \r\n we have a major problem and that problem is volatility \r\n craig <unk> contributed to this article \r\n a new

if investors the past few days are betting that something is going to go wrong even if they do n't know what \r\n if the stock market and the economy catch their breath and show that they 're on

have been heavily involved in dealing with the political <unk> of the <unk> theory named after the researchers who found in N that chlorofluorocarbons contributed to the depletion of ozone in the earth 's atmosphere and the montreal protocol \r\n an important part of my effort has been to understand the science so i can explain it to corporate colleagues facing major changes in product design \r\n in my research i have found a paper by joseph <unk> of the national cancer institute and several colleagues reporting an <unk> decrease in uv-b radiation at eight u.s. measurement sites \r\n our concern for the ozone layer of course grows out of the potential for increasing uv-b radiation which could damage <unk> and <unk> \r\n the last of the measurements reported was in N but recent conversations with mr. <unk> indicated that he knew of no recent changes in the trend \r\n i understand but have n't yet <unk> that there are studies by <unk> russians and the max <unk> institute that show either <unk> or declining uv-b at the surface \r\n to me this calls into question the <unk> of the <unk> theory and hence the whole chlorofluorocarbons replacement effort \r\n this in turn threatens the massive vested interests of which you have written \r\n my questions on this subject at a recent meeting at the world resources institute with representatives of the national resource development commission the environmental protection agency friends of the earth etc. were greeted with <unk> and some <unk> comments about that report being <unk> \r\n when i expressed <unk> that no

important part of the <unk> <unk> scenario \r\n subsequently i have learned that a private group of which du pont is a part is funding a modest program to continue data gathering at the <unk> report stations as well as to develop more sophisticated <unk> measuring instruments \r\n but this is almost an underground activity \r\n to my knowledge no government entities including the epa are pursuing uv-b measurements \r\n the topic never comes up in <unk> establishment meetings of which i have attended many \r\n it seems to me that such measurements are a vital part of any <unk> honest evaluation of the threat posed by cfcs \r\n while recognizing that professional environmentalists may feel threatened i intend to urge that uv-b be monitored whenever i can \r\n frederick h. <unk> vice president

from other securities activities long open to banks such as dealing in u.s. treasurys \r\n for some banks that N N ceiling created problems \r\n but by allowing <unk> securities inc. to handle private

enthusiasts rather than businessmen specialized spotted the appeal of <unk> bikes that go almost anywhere and began <unk> them in N \r\n in the past five years the company 's sales have grown to $ N

\r\n what i hope to bring to this is another word process \r\n that 's my challenge \r\n it 's mike 's challenge as well \r\n mr. eidsmo is one of several key people from outside the cycling industry

competition is <unk> as larger companies <unk> a mountain-bike market mr. sinyard 's company once had virtually all to itself \r\n u.s. cycling federation official philip <unk> says mountain <unk> is growing at such a <unk> rate that a lot of companies are getting into this \r\n one especially <unk> specialized market the new players are targeting is mountain-bike accessories which mr. eidsmo

's N independent biotechnology companies \r\n chugai has been one of the most active japanese players in u.s. biotechnology companies it has an equity investment in genetics institute inc. cambridge mass. and a joint-venture agreement with upjohn co. <unk> mich \r\n the japanese government mr. <unk> said has stated that it wants N N to N N of its gross national product to come from biotechnology products \r\n it is becoming more of a horse race every day between the u.s. and japan he said adding that some fear that as with the semiconductor electronics and automobile industries japanese companies will use <unk> technology to gain trade advantages \r\n mr. bologna said the sale would allow gen-probe to speed up the development of new technology and to more quickly apply existing technology to an array of diagnostic products the company wants to offer \r\n by N when only N genetic <unk> tests of diagnostic <unk> diseases of humans had been approved for marketing by the food

pinpoint how much money chugai would pump into gen-probe \r\n we think gen-probe has technology important to people 's health he said adding we think it is important for us to have such technology \r\n he and mr. bologna emphasized that both companies would gain technological knowledge through the sale of gen-probe which will expand significantly as a result of the acquisition \r\n in N chugai had net income of $ N million on revenue of $ N million \r\n <unk> had a net loss of $ N million on revenue of $ N million \r\n recently gen-probe received a broad u.s. patent for a technology that

stopped by to see their counterparts at the national space development agency of japan \r\n but after a few <unk> the soviets unexpectedly got serious \r\n the soviets have a <unk> space program the guests noted \r\n would n't the japanese like a piece of it \r\n the visitors then listed technologies up for sale including launch services and <unk> hardware \r\n we were just surprised says <unk> <unk> <unk> 's director for international affairs \r\n shocked \r\n that moscow with its <unk> economic machine would try to sell high technology to japan one of the world 's high-tech leaders sounds like a <unk> notion \r\n but the soviet union has areas where it is n't behind japan says mikhail <unk> of the soviet ministry of foreign economic relations \r\n we have obtained through the development of <unk> the soviet space program technologies you do n't see anywhere else \r\n the sales pitch might n't be as <unk> as it seems \r\n <unk> trade relations are <unk> these days and some japanese favor <unk> their reliance on u.s. technology in light of the <unk> <unk> <unk> when u.s. officials reversed an earlier decision and refused to share certain crucial <unk> technology \r\n and despite its image as a technology <unk> japan has a lot of weaknesses \r\n it 's a world leader in semiconductors but behind the u.s. in making the computers that use those chips \r\n it 's a world leader in auto manufacturing but its aviation industry is struggling and its space program is years behind the u.s. the europeans and the soviets \r\n one question being <unk> in the soviet union is how to use the defense sector 's <unk> expertise in the rest of the economy \r\n many plants that used to make military equipment are now being ordered to produce <unk> videocassette recorders small <unk> and <unk> machinery \r\n the soviets also hope to make better use of their considerable expertise in theoretical science which has helped them win twice as many nobel science prizes as the japanese \r\n where they lag behind the japanese is in turning the scientific <unk> into improved production \r\n by contrast the japanese have proved <unk> at making use of soviet <unk> \r\n kobe steel ltd. adopted soviet casting technology in N and used it for N years until it developed its own system \r\n <unk> steel corp. bought a soviet <unk> patent two years ago and has jointly developed

worry the u.s. japan 's principal ally \r\n we have never opposed the development of economic relations between our allies and the soviet union says a state department official \r\n frankly i would n't expect the japanese to get <unk> on anybody 's technology least of all the soviets \r\n under mikhail gorbachev 's perestroika the soviets have sought economic ties all over the world including new export markets \r\n they believe technology is one of their best bets and some soviet officials say moscow will even consider <unk> military know-how if the price is right \r\n the soviets held export <unk> that included high-tech items in new york and west germany \r\n last week a soviet delegation came to japan to push more space technologies \r\n japan is a major target for the soviets \r\n in august representatives of <unk> japan 's largest business organization visited moscow to explore exports and investments that would help the soviet economy \r\n out of the blue the soviet chamber of commerce handed over details on N technologies that the japanese might want to buy \r\n these mainly involved such areas as materials advanced <unk> machines for example and medical developments derived from <unk> in space such as <unk> blood vessels \r\n a main motive is hard cash \r\n but while the soviets ca n't expect direct technology flow from japan they also hope to benefit from japanese manufacturing expertise \r\n the soviet union has a lot of know-how but it has been difficult to put that into actual production because of various structural problems in the economy says mr. <unk> the foreign ministry official \r\n the soviets are contemplating a flexible system under which it would be possible to develop technology jointly and even to market it jointly he says \r\n even if the japanese find soviet technology desirable such discussions would be <unk> with political <unk> \r\n still <unk> from the international backlash over the sale two years ago of sensitive military technology to the soviets by a subsidiary of japan 's toshiba corp. many japanese are eager to avoid appearing to help the soviets in any way \r\n another hurdle concerns japan 's attempts to persuade the soviet union to <unk> its <unk> war ii control of four islands north of japan \r\n so far the soviets have provided only the <unk> information about their technology and business plans \r\n and what they have shown is n't impressive \r\n my impression is that there is n't anything which <unk> our interest at first <unk> says an official from japan 's ministry of

exchange members than in N with the bigger houses gaining a larger share of total commissions \r\n commissions however account for a smaller share of <unk> business as takeover advisory fees have

are expected to rise N N to about $ N billion this year according to the national sporting goods association which sees the home market as one of the hottest growth areas for the 1990s \r\n but even that group knows some people do n't use their machines as much as they should \r\n the first excuse is they do n't have enough time says research director thomas doyle \r\n the second is they do n't have enough discipline \r\n with more than N million exercise bikes sold in the past five years he adds a lot of <unk> <unk> and <unk> must be <unk> with them \r\n still the average price of such

folks and suggests <unk> potatoes are out of season \r\n of course that is n't really the case \r\n the <unk> may be because asking people about their fitness regime is a bit like <unk> about their love life \r\n they 're bound to <unk> \r\n people say they <unk> and that may mean they 've been to the beach this year says <unk> spain research specialist for the president 's council on physical

the president 's council now uses specific criteria to determine what is considered vigorous it must produce <unk> of large muscle groups must achieve N N of maximum <unk> capacity and must be done three or more times a week for a minimum of N minutes \r\n one of the council 's goals set in N was to see more than N N of adults under N years of age getting vigorous exercise by N \r\n that target has been revised to N N by the year N \r\n but even that goal may prove optimistic \r\n of N activities the journal survey found that N including <unk> skiing and <unk> are being done by fewer americans today than eight years ago \r\n time pressures and the <unk> of the fitness fad are cited as reasons for the decline \r\n only walking and golf increased in popularity during the 1980s and

recent outcry over program trading will cast a pall over the <unk> environment in the coming months some analysts say \r\n the public is very close to having had it mr. <unk> says \r\n investors pulled back from bond funds in september too \r\n net sales of bond funds for the month totaled $ N billion down two-thirds from $ N billion in august \r\n the major reason heavy outflows from high-risk high-yield junk bond funds \r\n big withdrawals from the junk funds have continued this month \r\n overall net sales of all mutual funds excluding money market funds fell to $ N billion in september from $ N billion in august the trade group said \r\n small net inflows into stock and bond funds were offset by slight declines in the value of mutual fund stock and bond portfolios stemming

emphasized that new accounts new sales inquiries and subsequent sales of stock funds are all up this month from september 's level \r\n investor interest in stock funds has n't stalled at all mr.

he says \r\n but mr. <unk> adds sales based on a few days ' events do n't tell you much about october 's trends \r\n one trend that continues is growth in the money invested in funds \r\n buoyed by

funds at the expense of growth and aggressive growth funds says <unk> <unk> an analyst at strategic insight a new york <unk> concern \r\n secretary of state baker we read decided to kill a speech that robert gates deputy national security adviser and a career soviet expert was going to give to a student <unk> the national <unk> security conference \r\n we keep wondering what mr. gates wanted to say \r\n perhaps he might have cited mr. gorbachev 's need for a stable currency free and competitive markets private property and real prices and other <unk> reforms \r\n perhaps he 'd have called for a <unk> political and economic system without a dominant communist party \r\n or political arrangements to alleviate the <unk> and demands of soviet ethnic minorities and republics \r\n why a bob gates might even have said nor are soviet problems susceptible to rescue from abroad through abundant western credits \r\n if mr. gates had been allowed to say these things we would now be hearing about <unk> and disarray on foreign policy \r\n dark hints would be raised that parts of the administration hope mr. gorbachev would fail just as they were when vice president quayle voiced similar <unk> \r\n it 's somehow ok for secretary baker himself however to say all the same things \r\n in fact he did the quotes above are from mr. baker 's speech of two weeks ago \r\n so far as we can see there is no disagreement among mr. baker mr. quayle the mr. gates we 've read or for that matter president bush \r\n they all understand point one nothing the u.s. can do will make much difference in whether mr. gorbachev succeeds with perestroika \r\n perhaps mr. gates would <unk> more than mr. baker the many hurdles the soviet leader must leap if he is going to succeed \r\n but everyone agrees that mr. gorbachev 's problems result from the failure of his own system \r\n they can be relieved only by changing that system not by pouring western money into it \r\n gatt membership will not matter to <unk> coal miners short of soap nor will a start treaty make any difference to <unk> <unk> \r\n on the other hand so long as mr. gorbachev is easing his grip on his empire everyone we 've heard agrees that the u.s. can benefit by engaging him \r\n if a deal can be made to cut the world 's <unk> loose from moscow why not \r\n we do n't expect much good from <unk> control but <unk> talks might <unk> eastern europe \r\n there 's nothing in the least <unk> in all this and it would be nice to think that washington could <unk> a reasonably sophisticated complex view \r\n yet much of the political culture seems intent on <unk> the bush administration for not helping mr. gorbachev \r\n so every time a bush official raises a doubt about mr. gorbachev the washington community <unk> cold war and <unk> and an administration spokesman is quickly <unk> out to <unk> mr. bush wants perestroika to succeed \r\n mr. baker seems especially sensitive to the washington <unk> known as <unk> \r\n its symptoms include a cold sweat at the sound of debate <unk> hands in the face of congressional criticism and <unk> <unk> when someone writes the word controversy \r\n as one unidentified official clearly in the late stages of the disease told the times baker just felt that there were some lines in the speech that could be <unk> and seized by the press \r\n in short the problem is not <unk> disagreement but <unk> with the prospect that <unk> might fail and its political opponents will ask who lost gorbachev \r\n mr. baker may want to avoid criticism from senate majority leader george mitchell but as secretary of state his audience is the entire free world not just congress \r\n in any case he 's likely to find that the more he <unk> his colleagues the more leaks will pop up all around washington a lesson once learned by henry <unk> \r\n letting officials express their own <unk> can be educational \r\n we note that in rome yesterday defense secretary cheney said that european euphoria over mr. gorbachev is starting to be <unk> by a recognition of the magnitude of the problems he was trying to deal with \r\n it is in the western interest to see mr. gorbachev succeed \r\n the odds are against him as he himself would no doubt tell you \r\n the ultimate outcome depends on what he does not on what we do \r\n even if the press is ready to seize and <unk> these are not very complicated thoughts \r\n surely there is someone in the administration maybe bob gates who could explain them to college students or even <unk> \r\n <unk> e. jordan was elected to the board of this transportation services concern \r\n mr. jordan has served as executive director of the united <unk> college fund director of the voter education project of the southern regional council and <unk> to

the <unk> fled with less than $ N \r\n describing this and other <unk> killings sen. <unk> thurmond r. s.c recently urged fellow lawmakers to revive a broad federal death penalty \r\n the ultimate punishment he declared will protect the <unk> from the vicious <unk> individuals who commit these crimes \r\n there 's just one problem the law that sen. thurmond is pushing would be irrelevant in the case of the maryland restaurant <unk> and almost all other killings \r\n most <unk> are state crimes so any federal <unk> law probably would turn out to be more <unk> than substance \r\n yet the bill is riding high on the furor over drug trafficking \r\n senate republicans after repeatedly failing to <unk> <unk> amendments to unrelated legislation have finally gotten a <unk> <unk> bill through committee \r\n the democratic leadership agreed to allow a floor vote on the issue before the end of the year a debate certain to focus on the alleged racial <unk> of death sentencing \r\n even some democrats concede that there is probably a majority in the senate that favors some kind of broad <unk> measure \r\n the pending bill introduced by mr. thurmond would revive the <unk> federal <unk> laws by <unk> legal procedures required by the supreme court \r\n in N the high court <unk> aside all <unk> laws federal and state alike as unconstitutional \r\n but in N the court permitted <unk> of such laws if they meet certain procedural requirements \r\n for instance <unk> would have to consider specific <unk> and <unk> factors before deciding whether to condemn someone to death \r\n since that N ruling N states have <unk> the death penalty \r\n but congressional democrats have blocked the same from <unk> at the federal level with the exception of a N law allowing capital punishment for certain drug-related <unk> \r\n the thurmond bill would establish a federally <unk> death sentence for N crimes most of which were formerly punishable by death under federal statutes that the supreme court <unk> \r\n among these crimes are murder on federal land presidential assassination and <unk> \r\n the thurmond bill would also add five new crimes punishable by death including murder for hire \r\n separately the senate last week passed a bill permitting execution of <unk> who kill americans abroad \r\n amid the <unk> of punitive rhetoric surrounding the issue one critical question involves whether a federal death penalty on top of existing state laws would deter any would-be criminals \r\n for one thing it 's unlikely that many people would receive federal death sentences let alone be executed \r\n most of the crimes incorporated in the thurmond bill are <unk> rare killing a supreme court justice for instance or deliberately causing a train <unk> that results in a death \r\n in fact only N defendants would have been eligible for federal death sentences if the thurmond bill had been in effect in the past three years according to a study by the senate judiciary committee 's democratic staff \r\n the last federal execution before the supreme court 's N ruling banning the death penalty took place in N meaning that the federal government did n't exercise its execution authority for eight years \r\n in that sense the whole debate is sort of a fraud argues a democratic senate staff member \r\n it 's <unk> attention from serious issues like how to make <unk> fbi and customs work together on drug enforcement \r\n republicans acknowledge that few people would be executed under the thurmond bill but they contend that is n't the point \r\n many scholars are of the opinion that the mere existence of the penalty <unk> many people from the commission of capital crimes says sen. <unk> hatch r. utah \r\n executions regardless of how frequently they occur are also proper <unk> for <unk> crimes mr. hatch argues \r\n thomas boyd a senior justice department official says the new federal drug-related crimes punishable by death since last november may result in a jump in capital sentences though that has n't happened so far \r\n in addition to <unk> the old issue of whether death sentences deter criminals this bill has made race a major part of the <unk> debate \r\n before the bill left committee sen. edward kennedy d. mass attached an amendment that would allow a defendant to escape from a death sentence in <unk> shown to have <unk> out executions in a <unk> manner \r\n the amendment prompted an ironic protest from mr. thurmond who complained that it would kill capital punishment \r\n a large number of studies suggest that state judges and <unk> have imposed the penalty in a <unk> <unk> fashion \r\n and the kennedy amendment would <unk> not only federal but state <unk> in two important ways \r\n it would allow all defendants to introduce statistical evidence showing <unk> disproportionate application of the death penalty in the past \r\n and it would shift the burden to prosecutors to <unk> that discrimination caused any statistical racial <unk> \r\n that burden is very difficult if not impossible to meet says mr. boyd \r\n how do you prove a negative \r\n since most prosecutors would n't be able to demonstrate <unk> that racial considerations did n't affect sentencing executions everywhere might come to a halt mr. boyd explains \r\n at least N major studies <unk> to show that particular states have imposed the death penalty <unk> against <unk> of whites compared with blacks and against black defendants compared with white defendants \r\n conservatives question the <unk> of the studies and note that the supreme court ruled in N that such research regardless of its <unk> is n't relevant to a constitutional attack on a particular death sentence \r\n the kennedy amendment would in effect <unk> around the supreme court ruling \r\n lawyers would <unk> seize on the provision in their <unk> appeals says richard <unk> director of the <unk> legal defense and educational fund 's <unk> defense team \r\n mr. kennedy failed to get his amendment incorporated into last year 's anti-drug legislation and it will be severely attacked on the senate floor this time around \r\n but if it <unk> it could prompt other statutory changes according to the mr. <unk> \r\n it might force congress and the states to narrow the death penalty only to convictions shown to be relatively free of racial <unk> <unk> by repeat offenders who <unk> their victims perhaps \r\n narrowing the penalty in this fashion would clearly reduce whatever <unk> effect it now has \r\n and that in turn would only strengthen the argument of those who oppose execution under any circumstances \r\n a state judge postponed a decision on a move by holders of telerate inc. to block the tender offer of dow jones & co. for the N N of telerate it does n't already own \r\n vice chancellor maurice a. <unk> iii of delaware 's court of chancery heard arguments for more than two hours here but he made no comment and asked no questions \r\n he could

the offer will expire at N p.m. est on nov. N unless extended again \r\n robert <unk> an attorney for the telerate holders told judge <unk> the dow jones offer is arrogant and hostile \r\n he accused dow jones of using unfair means to obtain the stock at an unfair price \r\n michael <unk> an attorney for dow jones defended the offer as adequate based on what the company considers realistic projections of telerate 's revenue growth in the range of N N \r\n he also contended that the plaintiffs failed to cite any legal authority that would justify such an injunction \r\n telerate provides information about financial markets through an electronic network \r\n dow jones publishes the wall street journal barron 's magazine other <unk> and community newspapers and operates electronic business information services \r\n japan 's exports of cars trucks and buses declined N N to N units in september from a year earlier the japan automobile manufacturers association said \r\n the association attributed the drop to a trend among auto makers to move manufacturing operations overseas \r\n with the exception of august when exports rose N N exports have declined every month from year-earlier levels since march \r\n lone star technologies inc. said its lone star steel co. unit sued it in federal court here seeking to recover an <unk> <unk> valued at a minimum of $ N million \r\n the lawsuit was filed by lone star steel 's unsecured creditors ' committee on behalf of lone star steel which has been operating under chapter N of the federal bankruptcy code since june N \r\n lone star technologies said it and its subsidiary 's creditors agree that the parent company owes the unit money but they have n't been able to reach agreement on the amount \r\n <unk> <unk> lawyer for the creditors said the creditors group is challenging certain accounting <unk> on the parent company 's books and estimates that the <unk> owed the steel company could be as much as $ N million \r\n the lone star steel lawsuit also asks the court to rule that lone star technologies is jointly responsible for a $ N million lone star steel pension payment that was due but was n't paid in september and that the parent company ca n't recover the amount from its subsidiary if the parent company makes the payment \r\n separately lone star technologies said the bankruptcy court granted lone star steel an extension until year end on its exclusive period to present a reorganization plan \r\n the <unk> exclusivity period was to expire yesterday \r\n under chapter N a company continues to operate but is protected from creditor lawsuits while it tries to work out a plan to pay its debt \r\n nothing was going to hold up the <unk> settlement of <unk> vs. <unk> \r\n not even an earthquake \r\n on the afternoon of oct.

N facility which builds chrysler <unk> and dodge <unk> models the toledo ohio jeep plant which dates back to the early <unk> and two canadian plants that build the jeep <unk> and chrysler 's <unk> vans \r\n chrysler has had to temporarily close the st. louis and toledo plants recently because of excess inventories of vehicles built there \r\n at chrysler 's N model <unk> last month chrysler motors president robert a. <unk> said the no.

N \r\n those rights prevent anyone other than revco from proposing a reorganization plan \r\n also under chapter N a reorganization plan is subject to approval by bondholders banks and other creditors \r\n a financial adviser for revco bondholders david <unk> of <unk> partners had mixed reactions to the offer \r\n he said he feared a revco reorganization might force bondholders to accept a cheap deal and that the bass group 's offer would give them more money \r\n however the group is offering to pay off bondholders in cash only $ N million and no equity \r\n the revco bonds are high-yield high-risk junk bonds holders have $ N million in claims against revco mr. <unk> said \r\n revco received the offer oct. N but issued a response yesterday only after a copy of the proposal was made public by bondholders \r\n acadia partners limited partnership a fort worth texas partnership that includes the robert m. bass group made the proposal \r\n mr. bass is based in fort worth \r\n analysts said the nation 's second-largest <unk> chain was a valuable company despite its financial woes \r\n its problem they say is that management paid too much in the leveraged buy-out and the current $ N million debt load is keeping revco in the red \r\n if bought at the right price it could still be profitable said jeffrey stein an analyst at mcdonald & co. cleveland \r\n in addition revco 's N stores in N states represent a lot of real estate he said and <unk> are helping <unk> the nation 's aging population will boost demand for prescription drugs \r\n last week revco 's parent company <unk> holding corp. said the company reported a loss of $ N million for the fiscal first quarter compared with a loss of $ N million in the year-earlier quarter \r\n sales were $ N million up N N from the previous year \r\n the company based in <unk> ohio said its operating profit before depreciation and amortization increased N N to $ N million from $ N million \r\n acadia partners and the bass group declined to comment \r\n the partnership also includes american express co. equitable life assurance society of the u.s. and shearson lehman hutton inc \r\n the offer consists of $ N million in cash and the rest in notes \r\n acadia would sell up to N N of the equity in the <unk> company to creditors and bondholders in exchange for the cash distribution but creditors and bondholders would receive no discount for their shares \r\n revco 's chairman and chief executive officer <unk> a. sells said both the company and the bondholders have put forth reorganization plans but little progress has been made since negotiations began this summer \r\n he said he has not met with representatives from acadia \r\n any reorganization proposal mr. sells said is difficult to assess because it must be agreed upon by the company bondholders banks and other creditors \r\n revco has $ N billion in claims outstanding \r\n it 's not like the board can decide by itself mr. sells said adding we 're <unk> to the bass plan \r\n we just want a plan that <unk> creditors and at the end leaves a healthy revco \r\n but mr. <unk> the bondholders ' adviser said revco was dragging its feet in responding to the proposal \r\n they want to <unk> it does n't exist he said \r\n mr. <unk> who met with acadia representatives on oct.

because of concern that demand for copper may slow down \r\n the december contract was down three cents a pound settling at $ N which was just above the day 's low of $ N \r\n futures prices fell during three of five sessions last week and the losses <unk> and <unk> were greater than the advances \r\n two of the major factors <unk> prices the prolonged strikes at the highland valley mine in canada and the cananea mine in mexico were finally resolved \r\n also the premiums paid by the u.s. government on a purchase of copper for the u.s. mint were lower than expected and acted as a price <unk> analysts said \r\n the mint purchases were at premiums about N N cents a pound above the respective prices for the copper \r\n at the time merchants were asking for premiums of about five cents a pound \r\n all this has led to prolonged selling in futures mostly on the part of computer-guided funds \r\n prices fell through levels regarded as important support areas which added to the selling \r\n the reluctance of traders to buy contracts indicates that they have begun focusing on demand rather than supply \r\n at least one analyst noted that as production improves the concern among traders is whether the prospective increased supply will find buyers because of uncertainty over national economies \r\n demand from japan is expected to continue strong but not from other areas of the world into the first quarter of next year he said \r\n japan normally depends heavily on the highland valley and cananea mines as well as the bougainville mine in <unk> new guinea \r\n recently japan has been buying copper elsewhere \r\n but as highland valley and cananea begin operating they are expected to resume their roles as japan 's suppliers \r\n according to fred demler metals economist for drexel burnham lambert new york highland valley has already started operating and cananea is expected to do so soon \r\n the bougainville mine is generally expected to remain closed until at least the end of the year \r\n it has n't been operating since may N because of attacks by native <unk> \r\n a recent attempt to resume operations was cut short quickly by these attacks \r\n

expected to be resolved quickly which may be one reason why the situation did n't affect prices much \r\n another analyst said that if there was any concern it was that a strike could encourage other <unk> in chile \r\n london metal exchange copper inventories fell N tons last week to N tons a <unk> decline \r\n but that development also had little effect on traders ' sentiment \r\n mr. demler said that stocks of copper in u.s. producers ' hands at the end of september were down N metric tons from august to N tons \r\n outside the u.s. he said producer stocks at the end of august were N tons down N tons from the end of july \r\n consumer stocks of copper in the u.s. fell to N tons at the end of september from N tons a month earlier and stocks of copper held by consumers and merchants outside of the u.s. at the end of july stood at N tons down from N tons in june \r\n the high point of foreigners ' copper stocks this year was N tons at the end of april according to mr. demler \r\n in other commodity markets yesterday \r\n grains and soybeans \r\n the prices of most corn soybean and wheat futures contracts dropped slightly as farmers in the midwest continued to rebuild <unk> that were <unk> by the N drought \r\n buying by the soviets has helped to <unk> up corn prices in recent weeks but a lack of any new purchases kept prices in the doldrums \r\n coffee \r\n futures prices rose slightly in a market filled with rumors that a new international coffee agreement might still be achieved \r\n the december contract ended with a gain of N cents a pound at N cents \r\n according to one analyst prices opened higher because of reports over the weekend that brazil and colombia at the <unk> summit meeting in costa rica had agreed to a reduction in their coffee export quotas for the <unk> of creating a new agreement \r\n the reports attributed to the colombian minister of economic development said brazil would give up N bags of its quota and colombia N bags the analyst said \r\n these reports were later denied by a high brazilian official who said brazil was n't involved in any coffee discussions on quotas the analyst said \r\n the colombian minister was said to have referred to a letter that he said president bush sent to colombian president <unk> <unk> and in which president bush said it was possible to overcome obstacles to a new agreement \r\n the minister was also quoted as saying that a new pact could be achieved during the first half of next year according to the analyst \r\n precious metals \r\n futures prices showed modest changes in light trading volume \r\n december delivery gold eased N cents an ounce to $ N \r\n december silver was off N cents an ounce at $ N \r\n january platinum rose N cents an ounce at $ N \r\n the market turned quiet after rising sharply late last week according to one analyst \r\n last week 's uncertainty in the stock market and a weaker dollar triggered a flight to safety he said but yesterday the market lacked such <unk> \r\n there was some profit-taking because prices for all the precious metals had risen to levels at which there was resistance to further advance he said \r\n the dollar was also slightly firmer and prompted some selling as well according to the analyst \r\n <unk> corp. said its board authorized the purchase of as many as five million of its common shares for employee stock plans and other general corporate purposes \r\n the forest-products concern currently has about N million shares outstanding \r\n in yesterday 's composite trading on the new york stock exchange <unk> shares closed at $ N down N cents \r\n when the supreme soviet passed laws on workers ' rights in may N and on <unk> cooperatives a year later some western observers assumed mikhail gorbachev had launched the soviet union on a course that would lead inevitably to the creation of a market economy \r\n their only doubt concerned the possibility that mr. gorbachev might not survive the opposition that his reforms would <unk> and that the whole process might be reversed \r\n if mr. gorbachev 's goal is the creation of a free market he and these western observers have good reason to fear for his future as economic <unk> within communist <unk> leads <unk> to demands for fundamental political reform accompanied by civil unrest \r\n these fears were clearly apparent when last week secretary of state james baker blocked a speech by robert gates deputy national security adviser and soviet expert on the ground that it was too pessimistic about the chances of mr. gorbachev 's economic reforms succeeding \r\n yet the soviet leader 's <unk> to <unk> on foreign visits and steady accumulation of personal power particularly since the last politburo <unk> on sept. N do not suggest that mr. gorbachev is on the verge of being <unk> nor does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika \r\n indeed the soviet miners strike this summer clearly demonstrated that mr. gorbachev must proceed with economic reform \r\n but is he so <unk> that he has achieved the political equivalent of making water run <unk> \r\n and has he truly persuaded the communist party to accept economic change of a kind that will sooner or later lead to its demise \r\n an alternative and more convincing explanation confirmed by recent events and a close inspection of the gorbachev program is that the new soviet economic and social structures are intended to conform to a model other than that of the market \r\n for example while the laws on individual labor activity allow a citizen to earn a living independent of the state strict provisions are attached on how far this may lead to the development of a free market \r\n before becoming self-employed or setting up a cooperative workers must seek permission from the local soviet council \r\n permission is far from automatic the soviets have the legal right to turn down applications and impose conditions and they appear to be exercising these powers \r\n private <unk> for example is allowed in N soviet republics but banned by five <unk> is allowed in seven but illegal in nine \r\n the controls on cooperatives appeared relatively liberal when first introduced \r\n but that changed following a resolution from the supreme soviet banning cooperatives from operating in some areas of the economy and permitting activity in others only if the cooperatives are under contract to the state \r\n all independent media activity is now illegal which perhaps is not surprising but so is the manufacture of <unk> cosmetics household chemicals and sand <unk> \r\n medical cooperatives among the most successful in the u.s.s.r. are banned from providing <unk> services their main source of income carrying out surgery and treating cancer patients drug <unk> and pregnant women \r\n earlier this month the supreme soviet adopted two more resolutions restricting the freedom of cooperatives the first enables the soviets to set prices for which goods may be sold the second bans cooperatives from buying industrial and food goods from the state or other cooperatives \r\n if mr. gorbachev is looking toward <unk> the productive forces of the market these latest resolutions are nothing short of reckless \r\n along with some other <unk> indicators these developments suggest that while mr. gorbachev wishes to move away from some rigid central controls he is <unk> on creating economic structures of a kind that would <unk> find favor with the <unk> or chicago schools of economic thought \r\n mr. gorbachev has ruled out the use of the market to solve the problem of insufficient consumer goods \r\n he told the congress of people 's deputies on may N we do not share this approach since it would immediately destroy the social situation and disrupt all the processes in the country \r\n having rejected central economic planning for economic reasons and the market for fear of the social political consequences mr. gorbachev seeks a third way that would combine the discipline and controls of the former with the economic benefits of the latter \r\n most important this would leave the party intact and its monopoly of political power largely <unk> \r\n indeed mr. gorbachev 's proposals display a close conceptual <unk> to the <unk> of italian <unk> whose architects spoke specifically of a third way of having produced a historic <unk> of socialism and capitalism \r\n they too promised to combine economic efficiency with order and discipline \r\n the emergence of russian <unk> had been anticipated in journalist george urban 's introduction to a series of <unk> can the soviet system survive reform published this spring \r\n communism will reach its final stage of development in a <unk> <unk> <unk> in form <unk> in content and <unk> in style that will <unk> the world with <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> \r\n the <unk> concept of <unk> <unk> an organic society in which citizens were <unk> and morally unified and prepared to sacrifice themselves for the nation \r\n this unification was to be brought about through policies and institutions that would <unk> workers and employers with government in a fully integrated and <unk> society \r\n the key to the creation of the organic state lay in the formation of natural groups that would <unk> the role of <unk> \r\n by contrast a parliamentary system based on <unk> political rights and groups was held to cause rather than resolve conflict \r\n the <unk> of soviet perestroika to the <unk> social blueprint of <unk> was evident when mr. gorbachev presented his economic vision to the soviet congress \r\n in doing so he neither rejected a socialist planned economy nor embraced the free market \r\n instead he proposed a <unk> economy in which there would be a <unk> division between state direction of the economy and economic management \r\n the latter would be undertaken by enterprises joint stock companies and cooperatives \r\n these would not function <unk> but would act together to form combines unions and associations to tackle problems and coordinate their activities \r\n mr. gorbachev is in a much stronger position to pursue the <unk> ideal than was <unk> who was never able to influence business giants such as <unk> and fiat \r\n the soviet communist party has the power to shape corporate development and <unk> it into a body dependent upon it \r\n to ensure the loyalty of the business sector mr. gorbachev may offer concessions and powers that will allow the business community to preserve its own interests probably by restricting competition \r\n however mr. gorbachev must ensure that within this alliance the business sector remains subordinate to the party \r\n at the same time he must give it sufficient freedom to provide the economic benefits so desperately needed \r\n it is the promise of economic returns that is supposed to make the <unk> model attractive to both the party and labor \r\n the work force provides the third arm of the alliance \r\n within the alliance it is supposed to act as a <unk> force <unk> against excessive control by government or abuse of its economic position by business for either could result in a deterioration of its living standards under the new resolutions workers <unk> may demand that a cooperative be closed or its prices be reduced \r\n by providing workers with the opportunity to move into the private sector where wages tend to be higher and by holding out the promise of more consumer goods mr. gorbachev hopes to revive the popularity of the party \r\n at the same time the strategy requires that he deal effectively with those who seek genuine western-style political <unk> \r\n the most important development in mr. gorbachev 's policy for <unk> the opposition movement is the claim that the u.s.s.r. also <unk> from terrorism \r\n an increasing number of <unk> by the soviet press to opposition groups now active in the u.s.s.r. particularly the democratic union <unk> that they show <unk> <unk> and claim that they would be prepared to kill in order to achieve their aims \r\n it is possible that in <unk> such <unk> the ground is being laid for the arrest of opposition activists on the ground of terrorism \r\n mr. gorbachev would appear to see his central task however as that of ensuring that foundations of an alliance among labor capital and the state are properly laid before the demands for a <unk> system reach a <unk> \r\n if he were able to construct a popular and efficient <unk> system he or his heir would be <unk> to rein in political opposition and to <unk> control in eastern europe \r\n the weaknesses in his plan do not lie in the political calculations mr. gorbachev is a <unk> political leader perhaps one of the greatest but in its economic prescription \r\n contrary to widespread belief <unk> failed to live up to his promise to make the trains run on time it is doubtful whether <unk> <unk> will make soviet trains run on time or fill the shops with goods that the consumers so desperately <unk> \r\n miss brady is deputy director of the russian research foundation in london

standard equipment in the u.s. and western europe japanese corporations ' reputation as <unk> <unk> is only half right \r\n their factories may look like sets for a <unk> movie but their offices with

N N annually over the next five years according to some analysts compared with about N N in the u.s. \r\n and with a labor shortage and intense competitive pressure to improve efficiency more and more japanese companies are concluding that they have no choice \r\n we have too many people in our home offices says <unk> <unk> the president of the japan management association \r\n productivity in japanese offices is relatively low \r\n with japanese companies in a wide range of industries from heavy industry to securities firms increasing their market share world-wide the prospect of an even more efficient japanese economic army may <unk> foreigners \r\n but it also offers opportunities americans are well poised to supply the weapons \r\n japan may be a tough market for outsiders to <unk> and the u.s. is <unk> behind japan in certain technologies \r\n but for now at least americans are far better at making pcs and the software that runs them \r\n after years of talking about selling in japan more and more u.s. companies are seriously pouring in \r\n apple computer inc. has doubled its staff here over the past year \r\n lotus development corp. has slashed the lag between u.s. and japan product <unk> to six months from three years \r\n <unk> inc. has a bigger share of the <unk> market in japan than at home \r\n but the japanese have to go a long way to catch up \r\n typical is one office of the ministry of international trade and industry 's machinery and information industries bureau the main bureaucracy overseeing the computer industry \r\n personal computer <unk> are lined up on nearly every desk and <unk> copies of nikkei computer crowd magazine <unk> \r\n but amid the two dozen bureaucrats and secretaries sits only one <unk> pc \r\n while american pc sales have averaged roughly N N annual growth since N and west european sales a <unk> N N japanese sales were flat for most of that time \r\n japanese office workers use pcs at half the rate of their european counterparts and one-third that of the americans \r\n moreover japanese offices tend to use computers less efficiently than american offices do \r\n in the u.s. pcs commonly perform many tasks and plug into a broad network \r\n in japan many desktop terminals are limited to one function and ca n't <unk> with other machines \r\n the market planning and sales promotion office of nomura securities co. for example has more than N computers for its N workers a respectable ratio \r\n but the machines are n't on employees ' desks they ring the <unk> of the large office \r\n some machines make

third of the software market \r\n machines dedicated solely to word processing which have all but disappeared in the u.s. are still more common in japan than pcs \r\n in the u.s. <unk> of the office pcs are <unk> up to some sort of network \r\n in japan about N N are linked \r\n computers here are used for data gathering says roger j. <unk> who manages the <unk> group in <unk> & co. 's tokyo office \r\n some japanese operations such as <unk> rooms may be ahead of their american counterparts he says but basically there 's little analysis done on computers in japan \r\n of course simply buying computers does n't always solve problems and many american companies have <unk> by purchasing technology they did n't understand \r\n but healthy skepticism is only a small reason for japan 's pc lag \r\n various cultural and economic forces have <unk> demand \r\n because the japanese <unk> is so huge japan has no history of <unk> use and so <unk> <unk> especially among older workers remains a common <unk> \r\n i have no experience before with such sophisticated machinery says <unk> <unk> a <unk> executive vice president of japan air lines explaining his reluctance before accepting a terminal in his office this summer \r\n while most american employees have their own private space japanese <unk> usually share large common tables and rely heavily on old-fashioned personal contact \r\n top japanese executives often make decisions based on consensus and personal relationships rather than complex financial projections and fancy <unk> \r\n and japan 's management system makes it hard to impose a single integrated computer system <unk> \r\n besides a computer processing the japanese language needs a huge memory and much processing capability while the screen and printer need far better definition to <unk> accurately the <unk> <unk> \r\n until recently much of the necessary technology has been unavailable or at least <unk> \r\n some analysts estimate the average pc costs about N N more in japan than the u.s. \r\n but the complex language is n't the only reason \r\n for the past decade nec corp. has owned more than half the japanese pc market and ruled it with <unk> power \r\n with little competition the computer industry here is inefficient \r\n the u.s. market too is dominated by a giant international business machines corp \r\n but early on ibm offered its basic design to anybody wanting to copy it \r\n dozens of small companies did swiftly establishing a standard operating system \r\n that <unk> competition and growth allows users to change and mix brands easily and increases software firms ' incentive to write packages because they can be sold to users of virtually any computer \r\n if a record industry lacked a common standard sony cd owners could listen to a sony version of <unk> 's like a <unk> but not one made for a <unk> player \r\n that is the state of japan 's computer industry \r\n nec wo n't release its code and every one of the dozen or so makers has its own <unk> operating system all <unk> with each other \r\n ibm established its standard to try to stop falling behind <unk> apple computer but nec was ahead from the start and did n't need to <unk> in competitive allies \r\n meanwhile the big players have n't tried to copy the nec standard \r\n corporate pride as well as the close ties common among japanese manufacturers help explain why \r\n most rivals have a working relationship with nec often through <unk> of technology the japan personal computer software association noted recently \r\n they hesitate to market <unk> machines nec <unk> of such machines and marketing one would jeopardize their relationship \r\n the result according to many analysts is higher prices and less innovation \r\n while tens of thousands of software packages using the ibm standard are available in the u.s. they say only about N are written for nec \r\n a year ago japan 's fair trade commission warned nec about possible violations of <unk> laws for discouraging retailers from discounting \r\n in japan software is four to five years behind the u.s. because hardware is four to five years behind because nec is enjoying a monopoly complains <unk> <unk> the president of <unk> corp. one of japan 's leading <unk> publishing and software companies \r\n there are no price wars no competition \r\n an nec spokeswoman <unk> that prices are higher in japan because customers put a greater emphasis on quality and service than they do in the u.s. \r\n she adds that some technological advances trail those in the u.s. because the japanese still import basic operating systems from american companies \r\n but the market is changing \r\n the government is funding several projects to push pc use \r\n over the next three years public schools will get N million pcs a <unk> increase from current levels \r\n in the private sector practically every major company is setting explicit goals to increase employees ' exposure to computers \r\n toyota motor corp. 's sales offices in japan have <unk> the computers per employee that its own u.s. offices do over the next five years it is aiming for rough parity \r\n within a year <unk> corp. a major cosmetics company plans to eliminate N <unk> jobs by putting on a central computer network some work such as credit reports currently performed in N separate offices \r\n by increasing the number of pcs it uses from N to N <unk> <unk> electronics co. of <unk> hopes not only to make certain tasks easier but also to transform the way the company is run \r\n managers have long been those who <unk> their subordinates so orders would be properly acted on a spokesman says \r\n but new managers will have to be <unk> and <unk> and for that purpose it is necessary to create an environment where information from both inside and outside the company can be reached easily and also shared \r\n meanwhile more computer makers now are competing for the new business \r\n <unk> <unk> corp. a <unk> to the industry fought off a legal challenge and started selling nec <unk> last year \r\n it has won about N N of the retail pc market \r\n sony corp. which temporarily dropped out of the pc business three years ago started selling its work station in N and quickly became the leading japanese company in that market \r\n in a country where <unk> room is scarce laptop machines will take a large portion of the industry 's future growth \r\n toshiba corp. <unk> open that sector this summer with a <unk> machine that <unk> for less than N yen under $ N one of the smallest cheapest pcs available in the country \r\n fujitsu ltd. is <unk> the most expensive promotion campaign in its history including a <unk> <unk> at tokyo <unk> for its sophisticated <unk> fm towns machine which it <unk> for everything from <unk> the family <unk> to practicing <unk> bar <unk> \r\n many of the companies are even dropping their traditional independence and trying to band together to create some sort of standard \r\n two years ago most of the smaller makers joined under the microsoft corp. <unk> to adopt a version of the american ibm at standard \r\n that has n't generated much sales but this summer microsoft rallied all the major nec competitors to make their new machines compatible with the ibm <unk> standard \r\n a healthy <unk> japanese market could also make it far easier for japanese companies to sell overseas where their share is still minimal \r\n but it could also help american companies which also are starting to try to open the market \r\n as with many other goods the american share of japan 's pc market is far below that in the rest of the world \r\n u.s. makers have under N N share compared with half the market in europe and N N at home \r\n though no formal trade barriers exist the japanese computer industry is difficult for outsiders to enter \r\n if it were an open market we would have been in in N or N says <unk> pfeiffer who heads compaq computer corp. 's european and international operations \r\n his company without any major effort sells more machines in china than in japan \r\n although it has opened a new zealand subsidiary it is still only studying japan the only nation that has n't adopted <unk> specifications \r\n and because general retail centers such as <unk> have little presence in japan sales remain in the iron grip of established computer makers \r\n but the americans are also to blame \r\n they long made little effort here \r\n ibm though long a leader in the japanese mainframe business did n't introduce its first pc in japan until five years after nec did and that was n't compatible even with the u.s. ibm standard \r\n apple did n't introduce a <unk> machine one that handles the chinese characters of written japanese until three years after entering the market \r\n critics also say american companies charge too much \r\n japan 's ftc says it is investigating apple for allegedly discouraging retailers from discounting \r\n but the u.s. companies are <unk> their efforts \r\n apple recently hired its first japanese president <unk> away an official of toshiba 's european operations as well as a whole japanese <unk> team \r\n earlier this year it introduced a much more powerful <unk> operating system and a <unk> laser printer \r\n ibm just last year started selling its first machine that could run in both japanese and english and that substantially <unk> <unk> with its american products \r\n it may take five years to break even in japan says john a. <unk> who runs the <unk> office for <unk> & dodge a u.s. software company \r\n but it 's an enormous business opportunity \r\n from a reading of the somewhat <unk> <unk> medical literature on ru-486 the french abortion pill emerges as one of the <unk> <unk> around \r\n this is not only because it <unk> the <unk> a job at which it actually is not <unk> efficient <unk> only N N to N N of them depending on which study you read <unk> taken in <unk> with the pill boosts the rate to N N \r\n by contrast surgical abortion is N N effective \r\n abortion via the pill is far more of an <unk> than conventional surgical abortion \r\n it is <unk> the abortion part alone lasts three days and the clinical part <unk> a week 's worth of visits bloody one woman in a swedish trial required a <unk> although for most it resembles a <unk> period with bleeding lasting an average of N days and painful many women require <unk> shots to ease them through \r\n <unk> and <unk> are other common side effects \r\n timing is of the <unk> with ru-486 \r\n it is most effective taken about a week after a woman misses her <unk> period up through the seventh week of pregnancy when it is <unk> less effective \r\n that is typically about a <unk> window \r\n so far all the studies have concluded that ru-486 is safe \r\n but safe in the definition of <unk> bass of the reproductive health technologies project means there 's been no evidence so far of mortality \r\n no one has <unk> the long-term effects of ru-486 on a woman 's health or <unk> \r\n the drug seems to <unk> <unk> for three to seven months after it is taken \r\n some women clearly have no trouble eventually <unk> again the studies have reported <unk> in their programs \r\n but there are no scientific data on this question \r\n rather <unk> <unk> studies reveal that ru-486 can cause birth defects <unk> the british medical journal reported in N \r\n however dr. <unk> <unk> the french physician who invented ru-486 wrote in a science magazine article last month that the <unk> results could not be <unk> in <unk> and <unk> \r\n the drug has a <unk> structure similar to that of des the <unk> drug that has been linked to <unk> and <unk> cancer in some of the daughters of the women who took it \r\n all the published studies recommend that women on whom the drug proves <unk> not carry the pregnancy to term but <unk> a surgical abortion \r\n a risk of birth defects a sure source of lawsuits is one reason the u.s. pharmaceutical industry is steering clear of ru-486 \r\n one might well ask why bother with this drug at all \r\n some abortion advocates have been asking themselves this very question \r\n ru-486 probably represents a technical advance in an area where none is needed or at least not very much said <unk> <unk> president of the national abortion federation at a reproductive health conference in N \r\n many physicians have expressed concern over the heavy bleeding which occurs even if the drug fails to induce an abortion \r\n it typically takes from eight to N years to obtain the food and drug administration 's approval for a new drug and the cost of testing and marketing a new drug can range from $ N million to $ N million \r\n the health and human services department currently <unk> the national institutes of health from funding abortion research as part of its $ N million contraceptive program \r\n but the population council a <unk> $ N million nonprofit organization that has the backing of the rockefeller and mellon foundations and currently <unk> most u.s. research on <unk> has recently been paying for u.s. studies of ru-486 on a license from its french developer <unk> a joint subsidiary of the german pharmaceutical company hoechst and the french government \r\n in the year since the pill went on the french market the national organization for women and its <unk> former now president <unk> <unk> 's fund for a <unk> majority have been trying to <unk> the u.s. pharmaceutical industry into getting involved \r\n its <unk> prediction the pill will be available in the u.s. either legally or illegally in no more than N years \r\n following the <unk> and <unk> lead has been a generally <unk> press \r\n a june N article in mother jones magazine is typical of the general level of media ignorance \r\n for a woman whose period is late using ru-486 means no waiting no walking past picket lines at abortion <unk> and no feet up in <unk> for surgery <unk> health writer <unk> fraser \r\n it also means she will never have to know whether she had actually been pregnant \r\n wrong on all counts miss fraser \r\n ru-486 is being <unk> in france only under strict supervision in the presence of a doctor \r\n <unk> reportedly has every pill marked and accounted for to make sure none <unk> into the black market \r\n thus a woman who used ru-486 to have an abortion would have to make three trips to the clinic past those picket lines an initial visit for medical <unk> <unk> and those with previous pregnancy problems are eliminated and to take the pill a second trip N hours later for the <unk> <unk> either via injection or <unk> <unk> and a third trip a week later to make sure she has completely aborted \r\n furthermore because timing is so critical with ru-486 she will learn via a <unk> examination and <unk> not only that she is pregnant but just how pregnant she is \r\n no doctor who fears <unk> liability would likely <unk> a <unk> patient to the risk of hemorrhaging \r\n many women may even see the dead embryo they have expelled a sight the <unk> industry typically <unk> them \r\n at seven weeks an embryo is about <unk> of an inch long and <unk> human \r\n at the <unk> of pro-choice members of congress a four-year <unk> bill for title x federal <unk> assistance now contains a $ N million grant for development evaluation and bringing to the marketplace of new improved contraceptive devices drugs and methods \r\n if this passes a senate version has already been cleared for a floor vote that is likely early next year it would put the federal government into the contraceptive marketing business for the first time \r\n it also could put the government into the ru-486 business which would please <unk> <unk> at what they view as <unk> in the private-sector drug industry \r\n we do not know whether ru-486 will be as <unk> as some of the earlier <unk> methods released to <unk> <unk> <unk> from educated people who should have known better \r\n remember the dalkon shield and the early <unk> pills \r\n we will not know until a first generation of female guinea pigs all of whom will be more than happy to volunteer for the job has put the abortion pill through the clinical test of time \r\n mrs. allen is a senior editor of insight magazine \r\n this article is adapted from one in the october american <unk> \r\n on june N a major part of our trade deficit went <unk> \r\n no figure <unk> no <unk> just <unk> improved recording of some of our exports \r\n the result \r\n the commerce department found that u.s. exports in N net of imports were <unk> by $ N billion a year and <unk> at the annualized rate of $ N billion in the first quarter of N \r\n more than half of the newly found net exports were from just a few <unk> categories \r\n some of the biggest <unk> exporters american <unk> companies for example have yet to be fully included in our export statistics \r\n nearly N years ago representatives of <unk> companies worked out a plan with the commerce department to improve the data on <unk> exports \r\n both groups believed that tens of billions of dollars of service exports such as <unk> tourism legal accounting and other professional services <unk> to foreigners financial engineering and construction services and the like were not being counted as exports \r\n the monthly trade deficit figure is limited to traditional merchandise trade manufactured goods and raw materials \r\n in the quarterly <unk> report those merchandise trade figures are merged with statistics on exports and imports of services as well as returns on investments abroad by americans and returns on foreign investments in the u.s. \r\n over time through benchmark surveys the corrected data on service exports and imports have been gathered \r\n the first three major areas of the service sector to be revamped were expenditures by foreign students in the u.s. net after expenditures by americans studying abroad some exports by professional firms a law firm billing a german client for services <unk> in watching legislation in washington is as much an export as shipment of an american jet engine and improved data from travel and tourism \r\n in just these three areas the commerce department found $ N billion more exports than previously reported and $ N billion more imports with the net result that the u.s. service surplus in N increased by $ N billion to $ N billion \r\n combined with <unk> and revisions in other trade areas the value of u.s. net exports that had not previously been recorded was about $ N billion a year \r\n that means that the u.s. trade deficit was running closer to $ N billion than to $ N billion in N and $ N billion annualized rather than $ N billion in the first quarter of N \r\n these revised figures also may explain some of the recent strength of the dollar \r\n the <unk> smaller trade deficit may have been already discounted in the market \r\n what does this mean for trade policy \r\n too early to tell but a trade deficit that is significantly smaller than we <unk> does suggest a review of our trade posture \r\n it does not relieve the need for our <unk> efforts for both goods and services but it does suggest that it is our exports of services and not just borrowing that is financing our imports of goods \r\n mr. freeman is an executive vice president of american express \r\n the collapse of a $ N billion labor-management buy-out of united airlines parent ual corp. may not stop some

N the ual board agreed to reimburse certain of the buy-out group 's expenses out of company funds even if the transaction was n't completed provided the group did n't breach the agreement \r\n the failure to obtain financing does n't by itself constitute a breach \r\n the merger agreement says the buy-out group is entitled to be repaid $ N million in fees for its investment bankers lazard <unk> & co. and salomon brothers inc. and its law firm paul weiss <unk> <unk> & garrison \r\n the buy-out group is also entitled to $ N million to repay a fund created by the pilots union for an employee stock ownership plan \r\n in addition to the $ N million for citicorp and chase salomon brothers is also owed $ N million for promising to make a $ N million bridge loan \r\n a spokesman for the buy-out group was n't immediately available for comment \r\n separately ual stock rose $ N a share to $ N in composite trading on the new york stock exchange on reports that los angeles investor marvin davis has asked united airlines unions if they 're interested in <unk> with mr. davis in a new bid for ual \r\n but neither the pilots nor the machinists appear interested and mr. davis is barred from making a new bid under terms of an agreement he made with ual in september unless ual <unk> an offer below $ N a share \r\n wall street continued to buckle under the public outcry against computer-driven program trading \r\n kidder peabody & co. a unit of general electric co. announced it would stop doing stock-index arbitrage for its own account and merrill lynch & co. pulled out of the practice altogether \r\n at the new york stock exchange which has been <unk> by complaints from angry individual investors and the exchange 's own listed companies chairman john j. phelan jr. held an emergency meeting with senior partners of some of the big board 's N stock specialist firms \r\n the specialists a trader said were <unk> about mr. phelan 's recent remarks that sophisticated computer-driven trading strategies are here to stay \r\n many investors blame program trading for wild swings in the stock market including the 190-point plunge in the dow jones industrial average on oct. N \r\n a specialist is an exchange member designated to maintain a fair and orderly market in a specified stock \r\n mr. phelan 's meeting with the floor brokers comes as he prepares to explain the exchange 's position on program trading to key congressional regulators in a closed session tomorrow according to exchange officials \r\n a big board spokesman would only say we 're working the problem and looking at the issue and meeting with a broad number of customers and constituents to get their views and ideas on the issue \r\n the program-trading outcry was taken to a new level when giant contel corp. said it and N or more of the big board 's listed companies are forming an unprecedented alliance to complain about the exchange 's role in program trading \r\n the decision by merrill the nation 's largest securities firm represents the biggest retreat yet from program trading \r\n merrill has been the <unk> stock-index arbitrage trader on the big board this year executing an average of N million shares a month in such trades or about one million shares a day \r\n merrill 's move is one of the most sweeping program-trading <unk> of recent days because the big securities firm will no longer execute stock-index arbitrage trades for customers \r\n most wall street firms in pulling back have merely stopped such trading for their own accounts \r\n merrill has been one of the main firms executing index arbitrage for customers \r\n merrill also said it is lobbying for significant regulatory controls on program trading including tough margin or <unk> requirements and limits on price moves for <unk> financial futures \r\n merrill in a statement by chairman william a. <unk> and president daniel p. <unk> said index arbitrage has been clearly identified in the investing public 's mind as a contributing factor to excess market volatility so merrill wo n't execute such trades until effective controls are in place \r\n in stock-index arbitrage traders buy and sell large amounts of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures and options \r\n the idea is to lock in profits from short-term swings in volatile markets \r\n last thursday painewebber group inc. also said it would cease index arbitrage altogether but the firm was n't as big an index <unk> as merrill is \r\n other large firms including bear stearns & co. and morgan stanley & co. last week announced a <unk> from index arbitrage but only for the firms ' own accounts \r\n kidder made an abrupt <unk> on program trading yesterday after a special meeting between the firm 's president and chief executive officer michael carpenter and its senior managers \r\n just a week ago mr. carpenter <unk> defended index arbitrage at kidder the most active index-arbitrage trading firm on the stock exchange this year \r\n index arbitrage mr. carpenter said last week does n't have a negative impact on the market as a whole and kidder 's customers were sophisticated enough to know that \r\n but yesterday mr. carpenter said big institutional investors which he would n't identify told us they would n't do business with firms that continued to do index arbitrage for their own accounts \r\n we were following the trend of our competitors who were under pressure from institutions he said \r\n kidder so far this year has executed a monthly average of N million shares in index-arbitrage trading and is second only to morgan stanley in overall program trading which includes index arbitrage \r\n most of kidder 's program trading is for its own account according to the new york stock exchange \r\n kidder denied that ge 's chairman and chief executive john f. welch had anything to do with kidder 's decision \r\n but at least one chief executive said he called mr. welch to complain about kidder 's aggressive use of program trading and other market sources said they understood that mr. welch received many phone calls complaining about kidder 's reliance on index arbitrage as a major business \r\n kidder has generally been sensitive to suggestions that ge makes decisions for its kidder unit \r\n our decision had nothing to do with any pressure mr. welch received mr. carpenter said \r\n this was a kidder peabody <unk> decision \r\n a spokeswoman for ge in fairfield conn. said absolutely no one spoke to jack welch on this subject and added anyone who claims they talked to jack welch is n't telling the truth \r\n supporters of index arbitrage have n't been publicly sticking up for the trading strategy as some did during the post-crash outcry of N \r\n but merrill lynch in its statement about pulling out of index arbitrage suggested that the current debate has missed the mark \r\n merrill said it continues to believe that the causes of excess market volatility are far more complex than any particular computer trading strategy \r\n indeed there are legitimate hedging strategies used by managers of large portfolios such as pension funds that involve program trading as a means of protecting the assets of their pension beneficiaries \r\n merrill 's index arbitragers will continue to do other kinds of <unk> program trading so there probably wo n't be any layoffs at the firm people familiar with merrill 's program operation said \r\n meanwhile bear stearns chairman and chief executive alan c. greenberg said his firm will continue stock-index arbitrage for its clients \r\n at the firm 's annual meeting last night he told shareholders that index arbitrage wo n't go away despite the public outcry \r\n if they think they are going to stop index arbitrage by causing a few wall street firms to quit they are crazy mr. greenberg said \r\n it 's not going to stop it at all \r\n mr. greenberg noting that stock-index arbitrage rises and <unk> with stock market 's volatility said that for the first four months of the firm 's fiscal year beginning in july stock-index arbitrage had been a break-even proposition for bear stearns \r\n in response to a shareholder 's suggestion mr. greenberg agreed that european firms will simply pick up the index-arbitrage business left behind by u.s. institutions \r\n pressure from big institutional investors has been the major catalyst for wall street 's program-trading <unk> \r\n and there was speculation yesterday that fidelity investments and other large mutual-fund companies might soon follow the lead of kemper corp. and other institutions in cutting off trading business to securities firms that do program trading \r\n a fidelity spokesman in boston denied the speculation saying the program-trading issue was more of a regulatory problem \r\n but a much smaller mutual fund company the <unk> investment management co. unit of <unk> san antonio texas said it informed nine national brokerage firms it will cease business with them unless they stop index-arbitrage trading \r\n <unk> with N mutual fund accounts manages more than $ N billion $ N billion of which is in the stock market \r\n michael j.c. roth <unk> executive vice president called program trading <unk> \r\n he said there is no valid investment reason for stock-index futures to exist \r\n a <unk> move is clearly on \r\n charles wohlstetter chairman of contel who is helping <unk> the alliance of big <unk> firms said he had no time to work yesterday because he received so many phone calls <unk> and letters supporting his view that the big board has been turned into a gambling casino by program traders \r\n we are reaching the moment of truth on wall street said rep. edward j. markey d. mass. chairman of the house subcommittee on telecommunications and finance \r\n wall street is beginning to realize as shakespeare said the trouble is not in our stars but in ourselves \r\n craig <unk> and

benefit guaranty corp. may require ltv corp. to <unk> funding responsibility for a $ N billion <unk> in the company 's pension plans \r\n the high court 's decision expected next spring may affect the stability of many large corporate pension plans that have relied on the availability of pension insurance provided by the federal pension regulatory and insurance agency \r\n the agency which is funded through insurance premiums from employers <unk> pension benefits for some N million private-sector workers who take part in <unk> pension plans \r\n it recently reported assets of $ N billion and liabilities of $ N billion \r\n in its appeal to the high court the agency said the federal appeals court ruling which favored ltv threatened to transform the agency from an insurer of troubled pension plans into an <unk> source of industry <unk> \r\n the ruling also may determine how quickly ltv is able to complete its chapter N reorganization \r\n ltv filed for protection under chapter N in federal bankruptcy court in N \r\n the filing was partly the result of the $ N billion <unk> in ltv 's three pension plans operated for its ltv steel co. subsidiary 's employees \r\n in january N as ltv steel continued operating while under reorganization the agency terminated the three ltv pension plans to keep its insurance liability from increasing \r\n termination means that the agency 's insurance assumes the liabilities and pays the pension benefits already owed under the plans but workers do n't <unk> new benefits \r\n a few months later under pressure from the united steelworkers of america ltv instituted a new program to provide retirement benefits similar to those in the terminated plans \r\n because the federal pension agency had taken over the old plans ltv would be responsible only for benefits paid under the new pension plans \r\n but the agency viewed the creation of the new plans as an abuse of federal pension law and an attempt to transfer the liability of the $ N billion <unk> from ltv to federal insurance \r\n the agency also concluded that ltv 's financial status had improved while it was under reorganization \r\n in september N it ordered ltv to <unk> liability and funding for the three original plans \r\n ltv challenged the order and a federal district court in new york in june N ruled that the agency improperly ordered ltv to <unk> responsibility for the plans \r\n in may a federal appeals court in new york agreed that the agency acted <unk> \r\n the appeals court said there was no evidence that congress intended to allow the pension agency to consider a company 's creation of new benefit plans as a basis for ordering that company to <unk> liability for old plans \r\n the appeals court also said the agency had to consider a company 's long-term ability to fund pension plans not just short-term improved financial status \r\n in dallas ltv said that it was disappointed that the court agreed to hear the case because it believes the move will further delay its chapter N proceedings \r\n the company has n't been able to come up with a reorganization plan in part because of the sizable disagreement with the pension agency \r\n but ltv a steel aerospace and energy concern said it is confident that the supreme court will <unk> the <unk> decisions and said it expects to continue discussions with the agency about a settlement while the case is being reviewed \r\n pension benefit guaranty corp. vs. ltv corp \r\n the commercial was absolutely silent \r\n breaking into the <unk> chicago <unk> <unk> match during

for injuries or deaths when the maker of an individual <unk> is unknown \r\n the high court 's action refusing to hear appeals by several drug companies is likely to have a significant impact at several levels \r\n the most immediate effect is in new york where former manufacturers of the <unk> drug des the synthetic female <unk> <unk> face the prospect of shared liability for damages in many of the N to N des lawsuits pending in that state \r\n the lawsuits stemmed from the development of cancer and other problems in the daughters of women who took the drug \r\n on a broader scale the ruling could encourage other states ' courts to adopt the logic of the new york court not only in des cases but in other <unk> lawsuits as well \r\n the new york court of appeals ruling parallels a N decision by the california supreme court requiring shared liability among manufacturers for injuries when it ca n't be determined which company is at fault \r\n paul <unk> a new york lawyer who

which was approved by the food and drug administration for use from the <unk> until N to prevent <unk> during pregnancy \r\n in N the fda banned the use of des after studies linked it to cancer and other problems in daughters of women who took the drug \r\n lawsuits over the harm caused by des have flooded federal and state courts in the past decade \r\n in many cases the lawsuit was filed long after the drug was used the cancer in the daughters was typically not detected for years and there is no way to prove which of several companies manufactured the <unk> consumed by certain women \r\n under traditional legal theories inability to prove which company manufactured a drug that caused an injury or death would lead to the lawsuit being dismissed \r\n but in its ruling last april the new york court said that all producers of the <unk> drug should share liability when the manufacturer of a specific <unk> ca n't be determined \r\n each company 's share of liability would be based on their share of the national des market \r\n the new york court also upheld a state law passed in N extending for one year the statute of limitations on filing des lawsuits \r\n the effect is that lawsuits that might have been barred because they were filed too late could proceed because of the one-year extension \r\n <unk> drug co. vs. <unk> <unk> squibb & sons inc. vs. <unk> and eli lilly &

for the contract that those specifications were met and that the government was warned of any dangers in use of the equipment \r\n but last february a federal appeals court in new orleans upheld a damage award against general dynamics rejecting the company 's use of the government contractor defense \r\n the appeals court said the defense is valid only if federal officials did more than rubber <unk> a company 's design or plans and engaged in a <unk> review and evaluation on a par with a policy decision \r\n general dynamics appealed to the high court backed by numerous business trade

mr. gonzalez and his colleagues particularly the finance minister carlos <unk> are charged with having abandoned their socialist principles and with having become arrogant <unk> who refuse even to go

with bank trade associations and the other government agencies that have a hand in fighting money laundering \r\n among the possibilities the treasury is considering are requirements that banks keep

alternatives for refinancing the debt \r\n western union had said two weeks ago that it might withdraw the pending offer which would have replaced $ N million in so-called reset notes now paying N N annual interest and set to come due in N with two new issues paying lower interest \r\n yesterday the company said it had filed a request with the securities and exchange commission to withdraw the registration statement regarding the proposed swap \r\n a western union spokesman citing adverse developments in the market for high-yield junk bonds declined to say what alternatives are under consideration \r\n but some holders of the western union notes expect the company to propose a <unk> debt swap that will give them a substantial equity stake in the company \r\n western union has had major losses in recent years as its <unk> business has faltered in the face of competition from facsimile machines and as other business ventures have gone <unk> \r\n the major question said one holder who asked not to be named is whether new york investor bennett s. <unk> whose <unk> partners controls western union is willing to offer a large enough equity stake to <unk> bondholders into agreeing to a new swap \r\n the $ N million in notes the largest chunk of western union 's $ N million in long-term debt stems from the company 's major restructuring in december N \r\n the notes became <unk> when reset provisions allowed their interest rate to be raised to N N last june \r\n western union had offered to swap each $ N face amount of the notes for six shares of common stock and two new debt issues a $ N note paying an interest rate starting at N N annually and rising in later years due in N and a $ N note due in N paying a fixed rate of N N and including rights protecting a

chaotic growth of cells that <unk> cancer \r\n scientists say the discovery of these genes in recent months is painting a new and startling picture of how cancer develops \r\n an emerging understanding of the genes is expected to produce an array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention \r\n that is for the future \r\n already scientists are developing tests based on the newly identified genes that for the first time can predict whether an otherwise healthy individual is likely to get cancer \r\n it 's a <unk> set of <unk> says <unk> vogelstein a johns hopkins university researcher who has just found a gene <unk> to the triggering of colon cancer \r\n only a decade ago cancer was a black box about which we knew nothing at the <unk> level \r\n today we know that the accumulation of several of these altered genes can <unk> a cancer and then <unk> it into a deadly state \r\n scientists call the new class of genes <unk> or simply <unk> genes \r\n when <unk> normally they make proteins that hold a cell 's growth in check \r\n but if the genes are damaged perhaps by radiation a chemical or through a chance accident in cell division their <unk> proteins no longer work and cells normally under control turn malignant \r\n the newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called <unk> \r\n <unk> must be present for a cell to become malignant but researchers have found them in normal as well as in <unk> cells suggesting that <unk> do n't cause cancer by themselves \r\n in recent months researchers have come to believe the two types of cancer genes work in concert an <unk> may turn <unk> cells malignant only after the tumor-suppressor gene has been damaged \r\n like all genes tumor-suppressor genes are inherited in two copies one from each parent \r\n either copy can make the proteins needed to control cell growth so for cancer to arise both copies must be <unk> \r\n a person who is born with one defective copy of a <unk> gene or in whom one copy is damaged early in life is especially prone to cancer because he need only lose the other copy for a cancer to develop \r\n emerging genetic tests will be able to spot such <unk> individuals <unk> in what some scientists believe is a new age of <unk> cancer <unk> \r\n bill and <unk> <unk> are among the first beneficiaries of the new findings \r\n the <unk> mass. couple knew even before <unk> became pregnant in N that any child of theirs had a N N chance of being at risk for retinoblastoma an eye cancer that occurs about once every N <unk> \r\n mr. <unk> N years old knew he carried a damaged gene having lost an eye to the rare tumor when he was only two months old after his mother had suffered the same fate when she was a baby \r\n because of the <unk> of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene it became possible last january to find out what threat the <unk> baby faced \r\n a test using new genetic <unk> showed that little will <unk> had not inherited a damaged retinoblastoma <unk> gene and therefore faced no more risk than other children of developing the rare cancer \r\n it made our new year says mr. <unk> \r\n this test was the first to predict <unk> whether an individual could expect to develop cancer \r\n equally important the initial discovery of the gene that controls <unk> cell growth made by a boston doctor named <unk> <unk> has opened a field of cancer study which in recent months has exploded \r\n it turns out that studying a <unk> but uncommon tumor made possible some fundamental <unk> about the most basic workings of cancer says samuel <unk> director of the national cancer institute \r\n all this may not be obvious to the public which is concerned about advances in treatment but i am convinced this basic research will begin showing results there soon \r\n to date scientists have <unk> two of these <unk> \r\n dr. <unk> made his retinoblastoma discovery in N \r\n then last spring researchers reported finding a gene called p53 which if <unk> turns healthy colon cells <unk> \r\n soon after that report two other research teams uncovered evidence that the same damaged p53 gene is present in tissue from lung and <unk> cancers \r\n colon lung and <unk> cancers are the most common and <unk> forms of the disease <unk> killing almost N americans a year \r\n right now about a dozen laboratories in the u.s. canada and britain are racing to <unk> other suspected <unk> genes \r\n they have about seven candidates \r\n researchers say the <unk> of tumor-suppressor genes alone or in combination appears crucial to the development of such <unk> as cancer of the brain the skin kidney <unk> and <unk> \r\n there is evidence that if people <unk> defective versions of these genes they are especially prone to cancer perhaps explaining finally why some cancers seem to <unk> certain families \r\n the story of tumor-suppressor genes goes back to the 1970s when a <unk> named alfred g. <unk> jr. proposed that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects \r\n he <unk> that in the eye cancer an <unk> inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other \r\n the tumor he suggested developed when the second normal copy also was damaged \r\n but there was no way to prove dr. <unk> 's <unk> theory \r\n back then scientists had no way of <unk> out specific genes but under a <unk> they could see the N <unk> of <unk> in the cells that contain the genes \r\n occasionally gross chromosome damage was visible \r\n dr. <unk> found that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome no. N from a parent who had had the disease \r\n under a <unk> he could actually see that a bit of chromosome N was missing \r\n he assumed the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in setting off the cancer \r\n but he did n't know which gene or genes had disappeared \r\n then a scientific team led by <unk> <unk> webster <unk> then at the university of utah found the answer \r\n the team used a battery of the newly developed gene <unk> <unk> of genetic material that can track a gene 's presence in a cell \r\n by analyzing cells <unk> from eye <unk> they found defects in the second copy of chromosome N in the exact area as in the first copy of the chromosome \r\n the finding <unk> medicine \r\n it was the first time anyone had showed that the loss of both copies of the same gene could lead to the <unk> of a cancer \r\n it was extraordinarily satisfying says dr. <unk> now at fox chase cancer research center in philadelphia \r\n i was convinced that what was true of retinoblastoma would be true for all cancers \r\n it was an <unk> claim \r\n but in baltimore dr. vogelstein a young <unk> <unk> at johns hopkins medical school believed dr. <unk> was right and set out to repeat the <unk> experiment in cells from other cancers \r\n his was one of two research teams in N to report dual chromosome losses for a rare <unk> cancer of the kidney called <unk> 's tumor \r\n dr. vogelstein next turned his attention to colon cancer the second biggest cancer killer in the u.s. after lung cancer \r\n he believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple hits on cancer <unk> genes because it often seems to develop in stages \r\n it often is <unk> by the development of <unk> in the <unk> which in some cases become increasingly malignant in <unk> stages <unk> from less severe to deadly as though a cascade of genetic damage might be <unk> \r\n dr. vogelstein and a <unk> student eric <unk> began months of <unk> and often frustrating probing of the <unk> searching for signs of genetic damage \r\n they began <unk> a confusing variety of genetic <unk> some existing only in benign <unk> others in malignant cells and many in both <unk> and malignant cells \r\n gradually a <unk> picture of cancer development emerged \r\n if both copies of a certain gene were knocked out benign <unk> would develop \r\n if both copies of a second gene were then <unk> the <unk> would progress to <unk> \r\n it was clear that more than one gene had to be damaged for colon cancer to develop \r\n their report galvanized other <unk> <unk> \r\n it was the confirming evidence we all needed that gene losses were critical to the development of a common tumor says ray white at howard hughes medical institute in salt lake city \r\n but dr. vogelstein had yet to <unk> the identity of the gene that if damaged <unk> a colon cell into <unk> <unk> \r\n they focused on chromosome N \r\n for months the johns hopkins researchers using gene <unk> <unk> <unk> down the length of chromosome N looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor cells \r\n such a piece of dna would probably constitute a gene \r\n when they found it last winter dr. vogelstein was dubious that the search was over \r\n his doubts stemmed from the fact that several years earlier a princeton university researcher arnold levine had found in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could transform normal cells into <unk> ones \r\n the <unk> dr. vogelstein found was in exactly the same spot as p53 \r\n but mr. levine had said the p53 gene caused cancer by promoting growth <unk> the johns hopkins scientists were looking for a gene that <unk> growth \r\n despite that when the johns hopkins scientists compared the gene they had found in the human cancer cells with the mr. levine 's p53 gene they found the two were identical it turned out that in mr. levine 's cancer studies he had <unk> been <unk> a damaged form of p53 a <unk> gene \r\n the discovery suddenly puts an <unk> gene right in the <unk> of cancer formation says robert <unk> a leader in <unk> research at <unk> institute in cambridge mass \r\n evidence now is emerging that the p53 <unk> gene is involved in other cancers too \r\n researchers in <unk> scotland have found that in N of N <unk> <unk> one copy of chromosome N was <unk> at the spot where gene p53 lies \r\n the scientists say that since <unk> cancer often strikes multiple members of certain families the gene when inherited in a damaged form may <unk> women to the cancer \r\n the p53 gene has just been <unk> in lung cancer \r\n in a report out last week john <unk> and colleagues at the national cancer institute say that about half the cells taken from lung cancer tissue they tested are missing this gene \r\n there also are reports from several labs as yet unpublished of missing p53 genes in tissue taken from kidney brain and skin cancers \r\n at the same time the johns hopkins team and others are rushing to pinpoint other tumor-suppressor genes \r\n dr. vogelstein hopes soon to <unk> one on chromosome N also involved in colon cancer \r\n ray white in utah and walter <unk> a researcher in great britain are close to finding another gene involved with some types of colon cancer thought to be on chromosome N \r\n dr. <unk> believes people who <unk> a defective gene somewhere on one of their two copies of chromosome N are especially prone to lung cancer \r\n recently he and others reported that the retinoblastoma <unk> gene may also be involved in some lung cancers as well as several other more common cancers too \r\n where these <unk> will lead scientists can only speculate \r\n already two major pharmaceutical companies the squibb unit of bristol-myers squibb co. and <unk> <unk> inc. are <unk> with gene <unk> to turn the anticipated cascade of <unk> into <unk> tests and maybe new <unk> \r\n some researchers say new cancer drugs to slow or reverse tumor growth may be based on the <unk> proteins normally produced by the genes \r\n the idea would be to <unk> to patients the <unk> proteins made by healthy versions of the damaged genes \r\n it may even be possible to replace defective genes with healthy versions though no one has come close to doing that so far \r\n in any case says dr. <unk> of the national cancer institute we 're <unk> the discovery of one of the most important steps in the <unk> of cancer \r\n many investors give michael foods about as much chance of getting it together as <unk> <unk> \r\n but now at least there 's a <unk> of hope for the stock \r\n burger king which breaks thousands of fresh eggs each morning is quietly switching over to an alternative egg product made by michael foods \r\n known as easy eggs the product has disappointed investors \r\n when the company this month announced <unk> sales of easy eggs the stock dropped nearly N N \r\n michael wo n't confirm the <unk> of any easy egg customers nor will it say much of anything else \r\n two minneapolis shareholder suits in the past month have accused top officers of making various <unk> statements \r\n these <unk> suits accuse the officers of failing to disclose that easy eggs were unlikely to sell <unk> enough to justify all of michael 's production capacity \r\n but at least burger king has signed on and says that by year end it wo n't be using any shell eggs \r\n the miami fast-food chain owned by grand metropolitan of britain expects to consume roughly N million pounds of <unk> eggs annually \r\n so there is reason to believe that michael 's hopes for a <unk> <unk> egg were n't all <unk> \r\n easy eggs are <unk> in a <unk> process \r\n still caution is <unk> \r\n a company official says michael 's break-even volume on easy eggs is around N million pounds a year apparently well above current shipments and a far cry from what the company once suggested was a <unk> market waiting for such a product \r\n perhaps to <unk> the analysts ' talk of <unk> michael today will take some of the skeptics on a tour of its new <unk> minn. plant \r\n there has been no announcement of the burger king arrangement by either party possibly for fear that mcdonald 's and other fast-food rivals would seize on it in <unk> advertising \r\n but burger king operators <unk> confirm using michael 's product \r\n other institutional users reportedly include <unk> which is moving away from fresh eggs on a <unk> basis \r\n the extent of <unk> 's use is n't known and <unk> officials could n't be reached for comment \r\n michael foods has attracted a good many <unk> the people who sell borrowed shares in a bet that a stock price will drop and allow the return of cheaper shares to the lender \r\n many analysts question management 's credibility \r\n the stock in my opinion is going to go lower not only because of disappointing earnings but because the credibility gap is certainly not closing says l. craig <unk> of <unk> <unk> \r\n mr. <unk> says that at a recent <unk> conference in new york he asked michael 's chief executive officer if the fourth quarter would be down \r\n the ceo richard g. <unk> replied yes but would n't elaborate \r\n the company did n't put out a public announcement \r\n a spokesman said later that mr. <unk> was being conservative in his estimate \r\n but the spokesman added that while michael will earn less than last year 's $ N a share it thinks street estimates of $ N or so are low \r\n analyst robin young of john <unk> & co. minneapolis calls himself the last remaining bull on the stock \r\n he argues that michael foods is <unk> this is a growth company in the packaged food industry a rare breed like finding a white <unk> \r\n earnings are n't keeping pace he says because of heavy investments in the egg technologies and <unk> costs in its potato business \r\n mr. <unk> however believes the company 's egg product wo n't help the bottom line in the short run even though it makes sense it 's more convenient and justifies its price which is higher than shell eggs because of health and <unk> concerns \r\n prospective competition is one problem \r\n last week a closely held new jersey concern

at N N yesterday in national over-the-counter trading \r\n says new york-based short seller mark <unk> in my mind this is a $ N stock \r\n michael late yesterday announced a $ N million stock buy-back program \r\n michael which also processes potatoes still relies on <unk> for about a fourth of its sales and nearly half its pretax profit \r\n but dry growing conditions in the red river valley of minnesota and north <unk> are pushing spot prices of potatoes beyond what michael contracted to pay last spring \r\n company lawyers recently sent letters to growers saying that michael would take very seriously any effort to <unk> its <unk> potatoes to other outlets \r\n still analysts believe that profit margins in the potato business will be down again this year \r\n pierre peladeau a canadian newspaper publisher <unk> in the u.s. figures to become a big player in north american printing and his ambitions do n't end there \r\n yesterday quebecor inc. a montreal printing publishing and forest-products company <unk> by mr. peladeau agreed to acquire maxwell communication corp. 's u.s. printing subsidiary maxwell graphics inc. for $ N million in cash and securities \r\n the purchase expected to be completed by year end will make quebecor the second-largest commercial printer in north america behind only <unk> <unk> & sons co. chicago \r\n the printing customers that quebecor will gain through maxwell graphics include the sunday newspaper supplement parade time sports illustrated and tv guide \r\n but the transaction is just mr. peladeau 's latest step in a larger design to build quebecor through acquisitions into an integrated paper publishing and printing concern with a reach throughout north america \r\n he already has achieved <unk> integration on a limited scale quebecor can put a weekly newspaper on almost any quebec <unk> without using outside help from <unk> down the tree to making the newsprint to <unk> it up onto the <unk> \r\n analysts say quebecor 's purchase is part of a trend toward consolidation in the north american printing industry \r\n along with <unk> says <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> thomson <unk> inc. in montreal quebecor has positioned itself as one of the two key players \r\n he adds i think this is a great strategic move for quebecor \r\n they are buying an operation that is running well \r\n mr. peladeau says he is n't trying to catch up to <unk> which has annual sales of over $ N billion \r\n size does n't matter mr. peladeau says \r\n what counts is the bottom line \r\n some of mr. peladeau 's ventures including an earlier push into the u.s. market have n't paid off on the bottom line \r\n quebecor started

N stood at a mighty $ N billion compared with $ N billion at the end of \r\n although the company could see fourth-quarter revenue shrink by nearly $ N billion if it is n't able to deliver any more planes this year those dollars actually would just be deferred until N \r\n and the company is certain to get out some aircraft with just supervisors and other <unk> employees on hand \r\n before the union rejected the company 's offer and the strike was launched with the <unk> shift of oct. N boeing had been counting on turning N aircraft out the door in the present period \r\n that included N of the company 's N jumbo jets its most successful product \r\n it 's not a pretty picture said david smith an analyst with raymond james & associates \r\n but it would just mean a great first and second quarter next year \r\n <unk> <unk> of merrill lynch capital markets added you do n't want to minimize this and say nobody is looking at it \r\n but the strike has n't gone on long enough for boeing to lose business in any real sense \r\n that 's the primary reason the company 's share price has held up so well when in mr. smith 's words most companies would have unraveled by now \r\n in new york stock exchange composite trading boeing closed yesterday at $ N a share off a <unk> N cents \r\n still boeing went through its normal <unk> <unk> and played up the downside \r\n in a statement chairman frank <unk> asserted that the company faces significant challenges and risks on both its commercial and government contracts \r\n for instance he noted that spending on pentagon programs is shrinking and boeing is either the prime contractor or a major supplier on many important military projects including the b-2 <unk> bomber the <unk> <unk> <unk> aircraft and the air force 's <unk> tactical fighter \r\n because of cost overruns on fixed-price military work mr. <unk> said the company 's defense business will record a significant loss in N \r\n moreover mr. <unk> added <unk> increases that have been implemented on the N N N and N programs have resulted in serious work force <unk> problems \r\n suppliers and <unk> are experiencing heightened pressure to support delivery schedules \r\n and of course there 's the <unk> labor situation \r\n besides the machinists pact accords representing N of the company 's engineering and technical employees in the <unk> sound and wichita kan. areas expire in early december \r\n also a contract with the united auto workers at the company 's helicopter plant in philadelphia expired oct. N \r\n this contract covering about N hourly production and maintenance workers is being extended on a day-to-day basis \r\n the machinists rejected a proposal featuring a N N base wage increase over the life of the three-year contract plus bonuses of N N the first year and N N the second \r\n on top of that boeing would make cost-of-living adjustments projected to be N N for each year of the contract \r\n the union though has called the offer <unk> \r\n the company reiterated yesterday that it 's willing to <unk> the package but not add to the substance of it \r\n for the nine months boeing 's net increased N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share \r\n sales soared N N to $ N billion from $ N billion \r\n in a separate matter the justice department yesterday said boeing agreed to pay the government $ N million to settle claims that the company provided inaccurate cost information to the air force while negotiating contracts to replace the aluminum <unk> on the <unk> tanker aircraft \r\n the settlement <unk> to four contracts negotiated from N to N prosecutors said \r\n they added that the settlement is the culmination of a N 1\\/2-year

vancouver canada is expected to kick off what could be a contentious battle for the right to transport vast quantities of gas to southern markets from <unk> fields in canada 's mackenzie river delta \r\n this is a <unk> strike by foothills said rick <unk> natural gas manager of the calgary-based independent petroleum association of canada an industry group \r\n foothills wants to make it clear to other pipeline companies that it 's on first <unk> as <unk> gas from the arctic to southern markets mr. <unk> said \r\n at least two rival applications are expected to emerge in coming months including one from transcanada pipelines ltd. canada 's largest natural gas pipeline operator \r\n another is expected from a consortium of oil and gas producers who won conditional approval this month from canada 's national energy board to export about N trillion cubic feet of mackenzie delta gas to the u.s. starting in N \r\n the producers include shell canada ltd. a unit of royal <unk> group esso resources canada ltd. a unit of imperial oil ltd. which is <unk> by exxon corp. and gulf canada resources ltd. a unit of olympia & york developments ltd \r\n the national energy board approval of the exports just <unk> the starting flag for the next stage the rush to build facilities to transport the gas said bill <unk> an analyst with brady & <unk> a washington d.c. law firm \r\n foothills ' main rival to build a mackenzie delta pipeline is likely to be transcanada pipelines \r\n the toronto-based company together with tenneco inc. of houston has had an incomplete proposal filed with canadian regulators since N that it is now <unk> \r\n like foothills transcanada 's <unk> gas consortium plans to build a pipeline directly south from the mackenzie river delta in canada 's western arctic with an initial capacity to transport N billion cubic feet of gas daily \r\n industry sources said they expect a fierce battle to emerge between transcanada which has a monopoly on canadian gas transportation east of alberta and <unk> and <unk> which control the pipelines within and running west of alberta respectively \r\n this is virgin territory <unk> and it 's going to be nasty said one <unk> who asked not to be named \r\n neither is going to back down easily \r\n transcanada declined to comment on the foothills application \r\n but last week gerald <unk> president and chief executive officer of transcanada said the company intends to be a party to any transportation system that goes up there and that it would consider joint ventures with other players to ensure it has a role \r\n a number of issues still need to be resolved before canadian regulators give any project the final <unk> \r\n first the price of natural gas will have to almost double \r\n kent <unk> president of foothills said the company believes the project would be viable if gas prices reach us$ N a thousand cubic feet by N in current dollars up from a current spot price of about us$ N \r\n mr. <unk> 's us$ N estimate is somewhat below the $ N floor price that calgary-based consulting firm paul <unk> & co. recently said would be needed for mackenzie delta gas producers to see a return on their investment \r\n u.s. gas buyers must also decide whether they want to enter firm contracts for mackenzie delta gas or develop alaskan reserves in the <unk> bay area first a project that has been on hold for more than a decade \r\n robert <unk> chairman and chief executive of foothills said it 's too early to say whether alaskan or mackenzie delta gas would flow to market first \r\n but foothills said it plans to seek regulatory approval to build an alternative line the alaska natural gas transportation system further north toward alaska \r\n if that option is favored by gas buyers and regulators foothills said it would build another smaller pipeline connecting mackenzie delta reserves to the alaska <unk> \r\n it 's also likely that regulators will try to forge some kind of consensus between the would-be pipeline builders before undertaking any hearings into rival projects \r\n douglas <unk> vice president of shell canada noted that producers would prefer to avoid hearings into competing proposals that would <unk> the regulatory review process and <unk> down development \r\n <unk> pipe line co. an oil pipeline operator rumored to be <unk> a gas pipeline proposal of its own said that is n't in the cards \r\n instead richard <unk> president and chief executive of <unk> 's calgary-based parent <unk> energy inc. said the company would prefer to work with other interested parties on a joint proposal \r\n as for foothills ' <unk> bid mr. <unk> said if they think it gives them some kind of priority position well that 's their strategy \r\n the federal reserve board said it is delaying approval of first union corp. 's proposed $ N million acquisition of florida national banks of florida inc. pending the outcome of an examination into first union 's lending practices in low-income neighborhoods \r\n the decision reflects the fed 's tougher stance on <unk> the community reinvestment act a federal law passed in N to help low-income residents obtain loans \r\n in recent years unions and community groups have won big commitments from banks to make <unk> loans in certain neighborhoods by threatening to hold up proposed acquisitions with protests to the fed about reinvestment act compliance \r\n few <unk> however have actually delayed or <unk> mergers \r\n the current dispute involves allegations that charlotte <unk> first union has n't lived up to its responsibilities under the reinvestment act \r\n during the summer legal services corp. a florida legal aid group filed a petition with the fed on behalf of residents in four florida counties \r\n the petition challenged first union 's lending record in the state saying that the bank-holding company had shut itself off from contact with the low-income community and is <unk> almost every black neighborhood that it serves in the state \r\n in deferring action on the merger the fed said the board does not believe that there is sufficient information in the record at this time to allow it to reach a final conclusion on first union 's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the communities it serves in florida and north carolina including low to <unk> neighborhoods in those communities \r\n the fed said the comptroller of the currency is expected to begin a community reinvestment act examination of first union 's florida and north carolina banking units in the next two weeks \r\n first union with assets of about $ N billion said it was disappointed by the delay but said it would cooperate with regulatory authorities \r\n the bank added that it believes the review will demonstrate that first union is in compliance with the requirements of the community reinvestment act \r\n the company has already missed its initial oct. N target date for completing the merger \r\n it said yesterday it still expects to close the acquisition later this year or early in N \r\n florida national if acquired would almost double first union 's banking franchise in florida to $ N billion in assets \r\n that would make it the second-largest bank after barnett banks inc. in a state widely considered to be the most lucrative banking market in the country \r\n in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday first union shares rose N cents to $ N \r\n florida national stock closed unchanged at $ N in national over-the-counter

creditors committee backed off a move to come up with its own alternative proposals to the carrier 's bankruptcy reorganization plans according to sources familiar with the committee \r\n in a meeting in new york yesterday the committee put on hold instructions it gave two weeks ago to its experts to explore other options for eastern 's future the sources said \r\n the consultants had been working to finish a report this week \r\n that means eastern a unit of texas air corp. of houston can go forward with its pitch for creditor approval as early as today when it is expected to deliver a revised reorganization plan to the committee \r\n the committee intends to meet next week to make a recommendation on the new plan \r\n in another development yesterday creditors were told that $ N million they had expected to become available for <unk> a reorganization may not <unk> according to one source \r\n texas air has run into difficulty <unk> about $ N million of debt securities because of problems in the junk bond market the person said \r\n and plans to raise another $ N million through changes to an insurance policy have hit a <unk> the source said \r\n an eastern spokesman said the $ N million will have no effect <unk> on the asset structure of eastern 's plan \r\n <unk> million in the total scheme of things is not that significant \r\n it is unclear what caused the creditors to do an <unk> on exploring alternatives to eastern 's new reorganization plan \r\n however since eastern first filed for chapter N protection march N it has consistently promised to pay creditors N cents on the dollar \r\n because the carrier is still <unk> to do that some committee members successfully argued that there 's little reason yet to explore a different plan according to one person familiar with the creditors ' position \r\n earlier this month the accounting firm of ernst & young and the securities firm of goldman sachs & co. the experts hired by the creditors contended that eastern would have difficulty meeting earnings targets the airline was projecting \r\n ernst & young said eastern 's plan would miss projections by $ N million \r\n goldman said eastern would miss the same mark by at least $ N million \r\n the consultants maintained eastern would n't generate the cash it needs and would have to issue new debt to meet its targets under the plan \r\n eastern at the time disputed those <unk> and called the experts ' report completely off base \r\n yesterday joel <unk> an attorney for eastern 's creditors committee declined to comment on whether the experts had ever been instructed to look at other choices and whether they now were asked not to \r\n he said only that the committee has not yet taken any position on eastern 's reorganization plan and that the two sides were still negotiating \r\n in every case people would like to see a <unk> plan he said \r\n eastern and its creditors agreed in july on a reorganization plan that called for the carrier to sell off $ N billion in assets and to emerge from chapter N status in late N at two-thirds its former size \r\n eastern eventually decided not to sell off a major chunk its south american routes which were valued at $ N million \r\n such a change meant the reorganization plan the creditors had agreed on was no longer valid and the two sides had to begin negotiating again \r\n eastern has publicly stated it is exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and has predicted it would emerge from chapter N proceedings early next year operating more flights than it originally had scheduled

\r\n what we 're seeing now makes a <unk> of the idea of insurance collect premiums from the healthy dump the sick and let them pay their own bills \r\n some lawmakers may seek legislation to limit

<unk> rates to the use of health care by a community or other large group and is designed to prevent insurance companies from taking only <unk> small companies as clients \r\n but first on the list of priorities says the national federation of independent business is to prohibit state laws requiring the <unk> of specialty items such as psychiatric care in basic health plans \r\n such requirements

seems likely to <unk> the economy throughout the 1990s \r\n that <unk> is hong kong 's economically rewarding yet politically <unk> relationship with china \r\n as a model of capitalist efficiency on southern china 's <unk> hong kong 's prospects look good \r\n china 's land and labor offer <unk> alternatives to local industry \r\n <unk> freight <unk> through the territory 's port \r\n in the decade since the communist nation emerged from <unk> its <unk> trade with the west has lifted hong kong 's status as a regional business center \r\n these benefits seem secure despite china 's current

generous <unk> for <unk> hong kong \r\n that promise sounds shaky now that those same leaders have fallen back on marxist <unk> and <unk> force to crush their nation 's democracy movement \r\n outflows of people and capital from hong kong have been growing since the sovereignty issue first arose in the early 1980s \r\n a widely held assumption all along has been that given its robust economy hong kong will be able to attract sufficient foreign money and talent to <unk> offset the outflows \r\n with interest in emigration and investment abroad soaring since june N that assumption no longer seems so safe \r\n investment and emigration plans take time to come to <unk> \r\n only four months have passed since the beijing massacre and few are prepared to predict its ultimate impact \r\n the only consensus is that more money and people may leave hong kong than had been thought likely \r\n this expected blow has cast a pall over the economy 's prospects \r\n the question as many

over the next few years i would advise caution \r\n in a <unk> published book on the territory a political economist <unk> <unk> has derived three future scenarios from interviews with N hong kong government officials and businessmen \r\n nearly half of them argue that hong kong 's uneasy relationship with china will <unk> though not inhibit long-term economic growth \r\n the rest are split roughly between <unk> who expect hong kong to <unk> along as before and <unk> who <unk> <unk> chaos \r\n the interviews took place two years ago \r\n since the china crisis erupted mr. <unk> says the scenario as <unk> by the <unk> group bears a remarkable <unk> to the difficulties hong kong currently faces \r\n the consensus of this group which he <unk> <unk> is that the local economy will grow through the 1990s at annual rates averaging between N N and N N \r\n such a pace of growth though respectable for mature industrialized economies would be unusually slow for hong kong \r\n only twice since the 1960s has annual gross domestic product growth here fallen below N N for two or more consecutive years \r\n the first instance occurred in N when china 's cultural revolution triggered bloody street <unk> in the colony \r\n the other came in N from the combined shock of world recession and a severe local stock market crash \r\n during the past N years hong kong 's economic growth has averaged N N annually \r\n given hong kong 's record mr. <unk> 's <unk> might have sounded <unk> conservative when the interviews took place two years ago \r\n under the current circumstances he says their scenario no longer seems <unk> \r\n the city could lose some of its entrepreneurial flavor \r\n it could lose some of its <unk> says mr. <unk> a director of baring securities hong kong ltd. a unit of britain 's <unk> plc \r\n it does n't have to be a disaster \r\n it just means that hong kong would become a less exciting place \r\n going by official forecasts of <unk> which measures the colony 's output of goods and services minus foreign income mr. <unk> 's <unk> seem relatively close to the mark \r\n after taking into account the fallout from the china crisis the government has projected N <unk> growth of N N \r\n the <unk> forecast published aug. N compares with an earlier forecast of N N published march N and a N N rate achieved in \r\n sir <unk> jacobs hong kong 's financial secretary says a further downward revision may be justified unless the economy stages a more convincing rally \r\n we are n't looking at anything like a <unk> scenario he says \r\n but clearly we 're entering a difficult period \r\n many factors besides a <unk> of N will have a bearing on hong kong 's economy \r\n one concerns japanese investors \r\n barely visible on hong kong 's property scene in N by last year japan had become the top foreign investor spending $ N million \r\n the market has grown relatively quiet since the china crisis \r\n but if the japanese return in force their financial might could compensate to some extent for local investors ' <unk> commitment \r\n another and critical factor is the u.s. hong kong 's biggest export market \r\n even before the china crisis weak u.s. demand was slowing local economic growth \r\n <unk> strong consumer spending in the u.s. two years ago helped <unk> the local economy at more than twice its current rate \r\n indeed a few economists maintain that global forces will continue to govern hong kong 's economic <unk> \r\n once external conditions such as u.s. demand swing in the territory 's favor they argue local businessmen will probably overcome their N worries and continue doing business as usual \r\n but economic arguments however solid wo n't necessarily <unk> hong kong 's N million people \r\n many are refugees having fled china 's <unk> cycles of political repression and poverty since the communist party took power in N \r\n as a result many of those now planning to leave hong kong ca n't easily be <unk> by <unk> improvements in the colony 's political and economic climate \r\n emigration applications soared in N when britain and china ratified their accord on hong kong 's future \r\n in N hong kong 's most <unk> year for a decade N left up N N from the previous year \r\n last year N went \r\n the government predicts that annual outflows will level off over the next few years at as much as N a projection that is widely regarded as <unk> low \r\n a large number of those leaving are managers and professionals \r\n while no one <unk> to know the exact cost of such a brain drain to the economy hardly anyone doubts that it <unk> a threat \r\n when the economy loses a big portion of its work force that also happens to include its most productive members economic growth is bound to be affected says <unk> <unk> an economist with hang seng bank \r\n while wall street is retreating from computer-driven program trading big institutional investors are likely to continue these strategies at full blast further <unk> the stock market trading executives say \r\n <unk> to a mounting public outcry three more major securities firms bear stearns & co. inc. morgan stanley & co. and oppenheimer & co. announced friday they would suspend stock-index arbitrage trading for their own accounts \r\n painewebber group inc. announced a <unk> on thursday from stock-index arbitrage a controversial program-trading strategy blamed by many investors for encouraging big stock-market swings \r\n though the trading halts are offered as a sign of concern about recent stock market volatility most wall street firms remain open to handle program trading for customers \r\n trading executives privately say that huge stock-index funds which <unk> wall street firms in terms of the size of their program trades will continue to launch big programs through the stock market \r\n wells fargo investment advisers bankers trust co. and mellon capital management are among the top stock-index arbitrage clients of wall street trading executives say \r\n these huge stock-index funds build portfolios that match the s&p N stock index or other stock indexes and frequently swap between stocks and futures to capture profits \r\n they will do it every chance they get said one program-trading executive \r\n consequently abrupt swings in the stock market are not likely to disappear anytime soon they say \r\n in fact without wall street firms trading for their own accounts the stock-index arbitrage trading opportunities for the big funds may be all the more abundant \r\n more customers may come to us now said james <unk> president of bear stearns <unk> \r\n executives who manage these funds see the current debate over program trading as a repeat of the concern expressed after the N crash \r\n they noted that studies completed after the N crash <unk> program trading as a source of volatility \r\n the issues that are now being raised in classic <unk> fashion fly in the face of a number of post-crash studies said fred <unk> chairman of wells fargo investment advisers \r\n a bankers trust spokesman said that the company 's investment arm uses stock-index arbitrage to enhance investors ' returns \r\n officials at mellon capital were unavailable for comment \r\n stock-index funds have grown in popularity over the past decade as pension funds and other institutional investors have sought a low-cost way to match the performance of the stock market as a whole \r\n many money managers who trade stock actively have trouble consistently matching the <unk> 's returns \r\n some stock-index funds are huge \r\n wells fargo investment advisers for example managed $ N billion in stock investments tracking the s&p N at the end of june according to standard & poor 's corp \r\n mr. <unk> said $ N billion of that is used in active index arbitrage \r\n stock-index funds frequently use the futures markets as a hedging tool but that is a far less aggressive strategy than stock-index arbitrage in which traders buy and sell big blocks of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from price differences \r\n the 190-point plunge in the stock market oct. N has heightened concerns about volatility \r\n and while signs of an economic slowdown softer corporate earnings and troubles with takeover financing all have contributed to the stock market 's recent weakness many investors rushed to blame program trading for <unk> market swings \r\n the wall street firms ' <unk> followed their recent <unk> by several institutional investors \r\n last tuesday kemper corp. 's kemper financial services inc. unit said it would no longer trade with firms committed to stock-index arbitrage including the three that later suspended stock-index arbitrage trading on friday \r\n phoenix mutual life insurance co. and <unk> asset management inc. also cut off brokerage firms that engage in program trading \r\n though it is still doing stock-index arbitrage trades for customers morgan stanley 's trading halt for its own account is likely to shake up firms such as kidder peabody & co. that still do such trades for their own account \r\n morgan stanley has consistently been one of the top stock-index arbitrage traders in recent months \r\n indeed morgan stanley 's president richard b. fisher said the firm is putting up money to form a group of regulators investors and investment banks to find out if stock-index arbitrage artificially <unk> stock-market volatility \r\n we have to clear up these issues and find out what is present that is creating <unk> volatility mr. fisher said \r\n there is no question that investor confidence in the stock market is critical \r\n joining the call for some kind of study or regulatory action merrill lynch & co. recommended program-trading reforms late friday including higher margins on stock-index futures and greater regulatory coordination \r\n separately mr. <unk> of bear stearns said his firm is working with regulators to balance margin requirements to enhance <unk> \r\n margin rules determine the minimum amount of cash an investor must put up when buying a security \r\n current rules permit investors to put up less cash for futures than for stocks \r\n some observers say that different rules governing stock and futures markets are partly responsible for volatility \r\n these rules they say permit faster and cheaper trading in futures than in stocks which frequently <unk> the two markets out of line \r\n stock-index arbitrage because it sells the more expensive market and buys the cheaper one attempts to <unk> the link between the stock and futures markets and the adjustments are often abrupt \r\n but <unk> trading rules allow the futures market to trade differently from stocks which invites frequent <unk> of stock-index arbitrage in the first place \r\n there has to be better coordination on a regulatory basis said christopher <unk> director of trading at <unk> securities corp \r\n one agency should have the authority over all equity products \r\n like so many trends in the entertainment industry the current spate of rape <unk> on television seems to represent a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> \r\n the former comes from the latest wave of political <unk> in hollywood especially around <unk> issues such as abortion \r\n the latter comes from the perception on the part of many people in network tv that their only hope of keeping viewers from <unk> to cable is to fill the <unk> with an increasingly raw <unk> \r\n put these together and you get programs about rape \r\n the best of the crop was last week 's season premiere of in the heat of the night the nbc series based on a N feature film about a black philadelphia police <unk> in a small southern town \r\n in the series <unk> <unk> howard <unk> and his wife <unk> <unk> johnson have settled in <unk> miss \r\n because the show has acquired a sense of place by being <unk> on location in georgia this episode in which <unk> gets <unk> by an arrogant white <unk> does a decent job of <unk> the social <unk> of the crime \r\n obviously it 's harder to establish a sense of place in a <unk> tv movie \r\n but tonight 's offering settle the score N p.m. est on nbc does n't even try \r\n this tale of a chicago <unk> returning home to find the man who <unk> her N years earlier is supposed to be set in the <unk> \r\n but it 's more like an illustration of what ben stein describes in his study of social attitudes in the tv industry fear of violence and <unk> because of race or <unk> fear and lack of <unk> about the politics of small-town people produce a powerful wave of dislike of small towns in the minds of tv writers and producers \r\n the writer and executive producer of settle the score steve sohmer is a graduate of yale who participated in a pbs <unk> aired this summer in which six members of the yale class of N <unk> about their lives since <unk> \r\n at one point in the <unk> mr. sohmer who is jewish says he felt rejected by many of the <unk> and <unk> he met at yale \r\n he quotes one student saying you 're just the kind of <unk> we <unk> ca n't stand \r\n mr. sohmer <unk> that it was partly in response to such attitudes that he is now a <unk> on one of the two islands off the coast of america \r\n but is <unk> in hollywood enough \r\n not to judge by settle the score in which mr. sohmer seems to be settling a score of his own \r\n of all the <unk> <unk> of small-town america i 've seen on tv this film is the most <unk> nasty \r\n the sole sympathetic character is the <unk> daughter kate <unk> smith and she is <unk> only by virtue of having nothing in common with her <unk> a truly <unk> pack of southern <unk> whose grim existence consists mostly of growing <unk> and <unk> sex \r\n i mean these folks are so <unk> that they blame pretty kate for the fact that when she was a <unk> someone tied her hands behind her back thrust her head into a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and beat her and then left her to die in a <unk> room \r\n her pa howard duff is the kind of guy who while saying grace at the <unk> table <unk> at the word <unk> and <unk> at the daughter he has n't seen for two decades because he knows in his heart that she enjoyed what happened in the <unk> room and has been <unk> the same taste ever since in the <unk> of chicago \r\n people like pa do exist of course \r\n but in mr. sohmer 's <unk> he is but the tip of the <unk> <unk> \r\n every man kate <unk> is either <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or all three \r\n add the fact that any one of them including pa could be her <unk> and you have a setting that does n't resemble small-town america or even hollywood 's nightmare of small-town america so much as a <unk> <unk> <unk> like margaret <unk> 's the <unk> 's tale itself soon to be you <unk> it a hollywood movie \r\n there are two exceptions <unk> jeffrey <unk> the local doctor who has always loved kate and lincoln richard <unk> kate 's <unk> but <unk> brother \r\n <unk> makes <unk> passes at kate when she 's <unk> with anger and fear but we know from the outset that he 's not a member of the evil <unk> \r\n how could he be \r\n he 's the director of the local planned <unk> chapter \r\n as for lincoln if you ca n't guess why he 's so sweet to his sister when everybody else <unk> her then i 'm not going to tell you \r\n as for the women they 're <unk> \r\n kate 's <unk> <unk> <unk> is a moral <unk> \r\n her <unk> <unk> wright is a <unk> <unk> afraid that kate will <unk> all the married men in town including a particularly <unk> fellow named tucker whose idea of fun is to leave his wife at home <unk> to her <unk> and cigarette burns while he <unk> kate into a dance that consists of <unk> on her while trying to break her <unk> \r\n at the very least it would appear that <unk> is a poor judge of <unk> <unk> \r\n yet even these <unk> <unk> are not as bad as the moral <unk> at the heart of settle the score \r\n in the <unk> episode of in the heat of the night we saw <unk> being attacked but we were n't invited to enjoy the <unk> \r\n in mr. sohmer 's film by contrast we are urged to share the <unk> excitement of the <unk> creeping up on his victim as the camera <unk> kate in various stages of <unk> and <unk> on the sight of her <unk> body during frequent <unk> to the rape \r\n at this point the truce between <unk> and <unk> gets mighty uneasy \r\n take the scene in which kate stands naked by a <unk> window <unk> to her hidden <unk> look all you want \r\n starting tomorrow i 'm <unk> you \r\n or the one in which she and <unk> are <unk> in the city and after insisting on separate motel rooms she <unk> on his door to pour out her feelings about the rape wearing nothing but a <unk> and a <unk> <unk> \r\n surely the question is obvious \r\n with friends like mr. sohmer do the <unk> of hollywood need enemies \r\n crossland savings bank 's stock plummeted after management recommended a

\r\n but <unk> this kind of <unk> plea to black <unk> makes it even more unusual \r\n still mr. <unk> thinks he can reach a good chunk of the three <unk> black homes he needs by mailing to the almost

show less <unk> women 's clothes moving away from its <unk> business <unk> \r\n one ad shows a bright red <unk> <unk> with a black leather <unk> \r\n and the ad copy is <unk> how can you be a wall street hot shot without at least one brooks brothers suit in your portfolio \r\n brooks brothers hopes that shaking its <unk> <unk> will attract more young men and more women and change consumer perceptions about its range of merchandise \r\n we have men who only buy their shirts and underwear here or younger customers who only buy their job interview suit here says william roberti chairman and chief executive officer of brooks brothers \r\n we want them to buy more of their <unk> here \r\n industry watchers agree that brooks brothers is long overdue in <unk> its <unk> image which has

that since the $ N million takeover sales growth has n't been dramatic \r\n for the N months ended march N operating profit at the <unk> chain totaled $ N million on sales of $ N million \r\n as brooks brothers <unk> into the fashion fray it will be playing catch up \r\n many <unk> especially ralph <unk> have <unk> in on the recent popularity of <unk> ivy league and english styles \r\n in keeping with men 's broader fashion scope today businessmen are <unk> in english and italian suits that are conservative but not <unk> \r\n the rigid ivy league customer brooks brothers ' bread and butter meanwhile is becoming <unk> \r\n thus brooks brothers has lost customers to stores that offer more variety such as paul stuart <unk> new york and louis boston \r\n brooks brothers no longer has a lock on the ivy league customer who is <unk> about his clothes says charlie <unk> president of the <unk> shop a traditional men 's store in cambridge mass \r\n by making a break from tradition brooks brothers is seeking a delicate balance \r\n if it <unk> fashion too much the shop risks <unk> its <unk> customers by <unk> value it risks <unk> down its <unk> <unk> \r\n fashion industry consultants also question whether the company can make significant <unk> in its women 's business given that its customer base is less established and that conservative business dress for women is on

stores \r\n wednesday it will unveil a $ N million <unk> at its flagship store on madison avenue \r\n with newly installed <unk> the store retains its signature <unk> look but is less <unk> \r\n more shirts and <unk> will be laid out on tables instead of sitting behind glass cases so that customers can walk up and touch them mr. roberti says \r\n because the biggest growth in <unk> is in casual <unk> brooks brothers is chasing more of that business \r\n the entire second floor of its madison avenue store is now casual <unk> featuring items such as ski <unk> leather <unk> and a $ N <unk> baseball hat with the store 's crest \r\n the centerpiece of the overhaul according to mr. roberti is the men 's tailored clothing department where brooks brothers has added new suit styles and <unk>

overcapacity in the synthetic fiber business which accounted for half of the dutch chemical company 's sales led to huge losses and left akzo 's survival in doubt \r\n it was n't until the early 1980s that akzo <unk> itself back to health \r\n now as a new downturn in the chemical industry looms akzo says it is in far better shape to cope \r\n investment analysts generally agree \r\n aside from slashing costs and investing heavily in its plants akzo has spent N billion guilders $ N billion on acquisitions since N to give it better balance \r\n during the same period the company has sold about N billion guilders of assets \r\n the fibers business whose products go into <unk> carpeting and <unk> industrial uses now accounts for only N N of akzo 's sales \r\n we have definitely become less cyclical <unk> bergsma executive vice <unk> said in an interview \r\n still akzo has n't yet found a way to achieve another goal a large presence in the u.s. market for prescription drugs \r\n mr. bergsma said prices for u.s. pharmaceutical companies remain too high making it unlikely that akzo will pursue any major acquisitions in that area \r\n but he said akzo is considering alliances with american drug companies although he would n't elaborate \r\n an indication of akzo 's success in <unk> itself will come thursday when it reports third-quarter results \r\n analysts expect the company to show profit of about N million guilders up N N from N million guilders a year earlier \r\n a bigger test will come next year if as many analysts expect bulk chemical prices slump in europe \r\n maybe akzo can surprise the investment world a bit said <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> bank <unk> \r\n he figures akzo is likely to be one of the few major chemical companies to show profit growth next year \r\n the bank projects akzo will show per-share earnings of N guilders in N up from an estimated N guilders for this year and the N guilders reported for N \r\n at james capel & co. in london analyst <unk> <unk> notes that akzo is less exposed than many of its rivals to the most volatile chemical products \r\n for example akzo has only minor petrochemical operations is small in plastics and does n't make <unk> \r\n thus while akzo <unk> less than many rivals from the boom of recent years in petrochemicals and plastics it has less to fear from the current slump \r\n the company is exposed to bulk chemicals however \r\n although <unk> prices have begun falling in the u.s. they are generally stable in europe mr. bergsma said \r\n a decline may come in the first half of N he said but the market does n't appear on the verge of a severe downturn \r\n to reduce the danger of such pricing cycles akzo has invested heavily in specialty chemicals which have highly specific industrial uses and tend to produce much higher profit margins than do bulk chemicals \r\n akzo 's biggest move in this area was the N acquisition of <unk> chemical co. 's specialty chemical business for $ N million \r\n in a less glamorous field akzo is the world 's biggest producer of industrial salt used as a raw material for the chemical industry as well as for such tasks as <unk> ice \r\n akzo also makes products derived from salt such as <unk> and <unk> soda \r\n in the fibers division profit remains weak largely because of persistent overcapacity \r\n but akzo is still <unk> down it recently announced plans to eliminate about N <unk> jobs in the netherlands and west germany \r\n although the <unk> and <unk> markets remain mostly bleak akzo has high hopes for some emerging fiber businesses such carbon fibers and <unk> extremely strong fibers used to reinforce tires and metals and to make such products as <unk> <unk> \r\n akzo 's <unk> <unk> fiber is a distant second to du pont co. 's <unk> which dominates the market \r\n mr. bergsma said world-wide industry sales of <unk> fibers are expected to total about $ N million this year \r\n sales growth of N N a year seems possible he said and akzo expects its <unk> business to become profitable in N \r\n akzo also has spent heavily on acquisitions in <unk> auto <unk> and industrial coatings \r\n in august for example it completed the $ N million acquisition of reliance universal inc. a u.s. maker of industrial coatings for wood metals and plastics from tyler corp \r\n mr. bergsma said akzo is likely to see strong profit growth from coatings as it <unk> cost savings and other benefits from its greater scale \r\n for akzo 's drug business where profits have shown <unk> change for the past five years mr. bergsma predicted moderate profit growth \r\n akzo is the leading seller of <unk> pills in europe but is still seeking regulatory approvals to enter that market in the u.s. and japan \r\n mr. bergsma said akzo hopes to have approval to sell its <unk> pill in the u.s. in N \r\n akzo also has small operations in diagnostic tests generic drugs and <unk> products \r\n <unk> products are showing especially strong growth mr. bergsma said \r\n among the leading products is a <unk> shot for horses \r\n we 're sorry to see nigel lawson 's departure from the british government \r\n he is a politician with the <unk> of true conviction as in <unk> <unk> exchange controls and in particular slashing the top rate of income taxation to N N \r\n but in the end his resignation as chancellor of the exchequer may be a good thing especially if it works as he no doubt intends by forcing prime minister thatcher and her counterparts elsewhere to <unk> the genuine intellectual issues involved \r\n the early <unk> we admit <unk> suggest so <unk> an outcome \r\n the fleet street reaction was captured in the guardian headline departure reveals thatcher poison \r\n british politicians divide into two groups of <unk> those with their <unk> cut and those <unk> the sky is falling \r\n so far as we can see only two persons are <unk> with a dignity recognizing the <unk> of the issues mr. lawson and sir alan walters the <unk> of the chancellor 's difficulties who also resigned as personal adviser to mrs. thatcher \r\n the problem is that on the vital issue of monetary policy and exchange rates conservative free-market economists divide into at least three <unk> camps \r\n there are the strict <unk> who believe that floating exchange rates free an economy to stabilize its price level by stabilizing the monetary aggregates \r\n there are the <unk> <unk> who seek to spread the advantages of a common currency through fixed exchange rates \r\n and there are the <unk> <unk> who <unk> <unk> to balance trade flows \r\n this is a problem not only for prime minister thatcher but for president bush as shown in the ongoing <unk> over the dollar between the federal reserve and the mulford treasury \r\n in the british case mr. lawson is the <unk> thing in london to a <unk> <unk> \r\n he not only slashed marginal tax rates initially <unk> fresh growth in britain but he wanted to regulate monetary policy by targeting exchange rates indeed joining the european monetary system \r\n while no doubt agreeing with mr. lawson on everything else sir alan is a <unk> <unk> inclined to defend floating rates to the death \r\n to make matters even more confusing the earlier u.s. experience made clear that mr. lawson 's tax cuts would have <unk> effects on britain 's international accounts and the value of sterling \r\n they increased the after-tax rate of return and made britain a far more attractive place to invest producing sudden capital inflows \r\n by accounting <unk> this had to produce a sudden trade deficit \r\n as in the u.s. it also produced a sudden burst in the demand for sterling that is a surge in the sterling monetary aggregates <unk> \r\n at this point the options were crunch money to stop the boost in the aggregates as sir alan surely advised and forget the soaring pound \r\n to push the pound even lower trying to cure the trade deficit a policy britain has repeatedly proved <unk> \r\n or to supply enough money to meet the increased demand and stabilize the exchange rate as the chancellor argued and ensure the <unk> of this policy by joining the ems \r\n faced with a similar situation paul <unk> let the dollar soar though monetary aggregates also grew so rapidly <unk> issued <unk> warnings of inflation \r\n but this <unk> the u.s. manufacturing sector laying the seeds of <unk> \r\n mr. lawson though not allowed to join the ems chose to shadow the deutsche mark \r\n he <unk> inflation along with rapid growth no doubt <unk> sir alan 's predictions in the prime minister 's mind \r\n but more recently the pound has been falling with high inflation which has also seemed almost <unk> to the high interest rates mr. lawson deployed to stop it \r\n so the british experience presents a genuine <unk> that reaches far beyond the <unk> of <unk> \r\n we had been soliciting opinions on it long before mr. lawson 's resignation and offer some of the collection for the benefit of his successor and one-time deputy john major \r\n to begin with we should note that in contrast to the u.s. deficit britain has been running <unk> budget surpluses \r\n in pursuit of this mystery <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> need not apply \r\n we should also add mr. lawson 's own explanation as we understand it \r\n unlike the u.s. britain never achieved even a <unk> reduction in real wages \r\n the wage <unk> which <unk> studies confirm is particularly high in britain gives its economy a structural bias toward inflation \r\n inflation is easier to spark and harder to control \r\n we should also concede that in the british experience the <unk> cause <unk> some of the credibility it lost in the u.s. experience \r\n nearby paul craig roberts a distinguished <unk> with <unk> <unk> argues the case for sir alan \r\n perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating rates though of course in the event mr. lawson resigned over whether to support a weak pound not restrain a strong one \r\n we recall that mr. roberts not only <unk> the chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to <unk> sterling but also led the chorus saying that mr. <unk> was too tight when he let the dollar rise \r\n somewhere in between there must be a golden mean perhaps measured by <unk> but perhaps measured by purchasing power parity \r\n the <unk> tend to think mr. lawson ran onto technical <unk> \r\n in <unk> rates the choice of initial <unk> is crucial for example and perhaps he picked the wrong <unk> rate \r\n for that matter perhaps he fixed to the wrong currency \r\n we <unk> with mrs. thatcher 's reluctance to tie her currency to one <unk> by the domestic political <unk> of west germany \r\n perhaps the shock would have been less if they 'd fixed to another <unk> <unk> <unk> economy \r\n alan reynolds of <unk> adds his <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> is the budget surplus \r\n those who can shake <unk> ghosts out of their heads might recognize that the retirement of <unk> for cash is equivalent to an <unk> <unk> operation indeed it is the definition of an open market operation to expand the money supply \r\n mr. reynolds also notes that since british banks have no reserve requirements high interest rates are less likely to curb inflation than to cause recession \r\n we would add that in political terms mrs. thatcher 's problem was failing to decide between the chancellor and her adviser \r\n in the end neither policy was followed and instead of learning anything we are left with a mystery \r\n in particular <unk> a currency is anything but <unk> it is an open announcement that the exchange rate target has no credibility \r\n all the more so when strong voices are heard opposing the policy \r\n better to have a true <unk> policy just for the experience \r\n so mr. lawson had to resign \r\n in the end his move was sparked by remarks in <unk> from sir alan 's <unk> in the american economist a <unk> academic journal \r\n but it was the underlying situation that became <unk> \r\n what mr. major and mrs. thatcher will do now remains to be seen \r\n they <unk> <unk> inflation and a sagging economy that is to say <unk> \r\n this can not be solved by <unk> a further downturn reducing the supply of goods does not solve inflation \r\n our advice is this immediately return the government surpluses to the economy through <unk> tax cuts and find some monetary policy target that <unk> both supply and demand for money which neither aggregates nor interest rates can do \r\n this was the version of <unk> economics that in the late 1970s and early '80s worked in america and world-wide to solve a far more serious <unk> than <unk> britain today \r\n ogilvy & mather whose declining profitability prompted its takeover by wpp group earlier this year will see its profit margins bounce back to the N N range in N said graham phillips the agency 's new <unk> \r\n the ad agency 's pretax profit margins were slightly under N N at the time of the takeover according to analysts london-based wpp 's goal is to increase margins to N N \r\n mr. phillips made his comments during an interview detailing his plans for the agency \r\n <unk> the <unk> ogilvy veteran was named last week to succeed kenneth roman who is leaving by year 's end to take a top post at american express an ogilvy client \r\n surrounded by <unk> of paper two computers and photos of himself <unk> and flying mr. phillips laid out several changes he hopes to make at the agency \r\n first and <unk> mr. phillips said he hopes to improve client service \r\n ogilvy under the <unk> mr. roman gained a reputation as occasionally being <unk> in its treatment of clients of <unk> what strategy a client should indeed must follow \r\n and some of its top <unk> executives including mr. phillips were <unk> to the point they were <unk> with administrative duties with little time to see clients \r\n but mr. phillips recently freed himself up to spend more time with clients by <unk> much of his administrative work to a deputy \r\n he also plans to get to know clients that mr. roman was closer to such as <unk> brothers american express and seagram \r\n the two men are planning joint visits to a number of clients to attempt to smoothly hand over the reins \r\n clients want to see more of our senior people involved in the business not once a month but two or three times a week he said \r\n mr. phillips also hopes to finally implement a reorganization announced earlier this year but put on hold by the wpp takeover \r\n the reorganization is supposed to make <unk> shopping buying advertising public relations and design all in one place or ogilvy <unk> in <unk> a reality \r\n under the reorganization ogilvy plans to name one executive on each account as a client service director to work as the client 's single contact for all those services \r\n there is little or no integration of our work quality is <unk> there is no single focus mr. phillips complained to staffers in march when the reorganization was announced \r\n now mr. phillips says he hopes to have the new system in place for several clients including american express american telephone & telegraph and ryder by year 's end \r\n industry executives and analysts are divided on whether mr. phillips is up to the task \r\n he is n't as well-known to clients as is mr. roman \r\n under his watch office <unk> was often rampant in the agency 's new york operation and the office there has had a dismal <unk> record for more than a year \r\n and while last week the agency hired a top <unk> executive bill hamilton to try to bolster its work graham has to get the revenue of that new york office moving says james <unk> an analyst with county natwest securities \r\n the one thing mr. phillips clearly does have going for him is <unk> although it is n't certain if that will be enough \r\n as mr. <unk> says the last thing they need is enormous disruption at the top and graham is obviously a long-term member of the ogilvy mafia as we call it \r\n mr. phillips and mr. roman are indeed quite similar in substance if not in style \r\n while mr. roman is a <unk> <unk> mr. phillips would rather delegate leaving him time for his interests outside the office \r\n mr. roman by contrast seems rarely to cut loose at all although he did appear at ogilvy 's halloween party friday <unk> out in duck feet and a duck hat <unk> as a <unk> duck \r\n mr. phillips said the company 's expected margin improvement will be all but inevitable given that the company 's profitability was dragged down this year by an expensive move to <unk> <unk> new new york headquarters \r\n the move <unk> at about $ N million actually came in at about $ N million he said \r\n but margins will be helped too by some other <unk> steps \r\n ogilvy eliminated the mail room staff closed the executive <unk> room and after the takeover let go half a dozen financial executives \r\n wpp which assumes financial control of its businesses in a <unk> way instituted a new financial system and plans to <unk> some floors in ogilvy 's new headquarters building to outsiders \r\n the fact that the agency will now be part of a u.k. company under british accounting rules will also make the profit picture look better \r\n <unk> 's klein steps down \r\n arthur klein president of young & rubicam 's new york office stepped down temporarily in the wake of charges by a federal grand jury in new haven conn. that he the agency and another top executive <unk> <unk> tourist officials to win its account in N \r\n in an internal memo alex <unk> the agency 's chairman said mr. klein decided to remove himself to minimize negative reaction from prospective clients and others and to prepare for his defense \r\n the fact that he is in the process of defending himself against the present charges could <unk> have an adverse impact on <unk> mr. <unk> wrote \r\n he said mr. klein will return to his post at the end of the trial at which he will be <unk> \r\n mr. klein will work with mr. <unk> on some of the agency 's joint venture activities and acquisitions while the case is pending \r\n peter <unk> president of <unk> 's ad operations will assume mr. klein 's day-to-day role \r\n wells rich 's new partner \r\n wells rich greene named <unk> heller as an executive vice president and creative partner in its image group which <unk> on fashion and <unk> <unk> advertising \r\n ms. heller N had headed up boston agency <unk> a unit of wcrs \r\n the agency with about $ N million in billings will be <unk> with some of its staffers absorbed by wcrs 's della femina mcnamee unit in boston ms. heller said \r\n she said it was too early to say what would happen to its clients including reebok and apple \r\n at wells rich ms. heller will concentrate on accounts that include philip morris 's benson & hedges cigarette brand which relies on print ads ms. heller 's specialty \r\n as previously reported the account is troubled with philip morris asking backer spielvogel bates ogilvy & mather and possibly others to try their hand at developing new creative work \r\n wells rich declined to comment on the status of the account as did the other agencies \r\n waxman industries inc. said holders of $ N face amount of its N N N convertible subordinated debentures due march N N have elected to convert the debt into about N common shares \r\n the conversion price is $ N a share \r\n the company said the holders represent N N of the face amount of the debentures \r\n waxman sells a variety of hardware products for the home repair market \r\n r.h. macy & co. the closely held department store chain said in a financial filing friday that its sales for the fiscal fourth quarter ended july N were up N N to $ N billion against $ N billion a year earlier \r\n comparable store sales for the quarter were up N N \r\n the net loss for the quarter was $ N million against a year-earlier loss of $ N million \r\n the loss in the fourth quarter of N reflected in part expenses for an unsuccessful bid for federated department stores inc. as well as the restructuring of some of its department store operations \r\n for the year sales were up N N to $ N billion compared with $ N billion in fiscal N \r\n sales for both years reflect 12-month performances for each year of i. <unk> bullock 's and <unk> <unk> \r\n macy acquired those three businesses in may N \r\n on a comparable store basis including the new acquisitions for both years sales for fiscal N were up N N \r\n macy reported a net loss for fiscal N of $ N million compared with a net loss of $ N million for fiscal N \r\n the company 's earnings before interest taxes and depreciation which bondholders use a measurement of the chain 's ability to pay its existing debt increased N N in fiscal N to $ N million from $ N million \r\n the $ N million figures includes the new acquisitions \r\n excluding those businesses earnings before interest taxes and depreciation for N would have been $ N million \r\n as of feb. N N the <unk> <unk> stores will operate as i. <unk> stores \r\n altogether macy and its subsidiaries own or lease N department stores and N specialty stores nationwide \r\n although management led a leveraged buy-out of r.h. macy in july N the company still makes financial filings because of its publicly traded debt \r\n the company estimates its total debt at about $ N billion \r\n this includes $ N billion of long-term debt $ N million in short-term debt and $ N million of the current portion of long-term debt \r\n in a letter to investors chairman edward s. finkelstein wrote that he expects the company to benefit from some of the disruption faced by our competitors \r\n while our competitors are concerned with their financial viability and possible ownership changes we will be concentrating on buying and selling merchandise our customers need and want \r\n mr. finkelstein is apparently referring to b. altman and <unk> teller two new york retailers that have recently filed for chapter N bankruptcy protection as well as the retail chains owned by financially troubled campeau corp \r\n those chains include bloomingdale 's which campeau recently said it will sell \r\n other retail properties for sale include saks fifth avenue and marshall field retailers now owned by b.a.t plc the british tobacco conglomerate \r\n in his letter mr. finkelstein also referred to the recent san francisco earthquake \r\n mr. finkelstein flew to san francisco the day after the earthquake and found that N to N of his company 's stores had sustained some damage including the <unk> of most windows at the i. <unk> store on union square \r\n the volume and profit impact on our fiscal first quarter will not be positive but looking at the whole fiscal year we do n't see the effect as material wrote mr. finkelstein \r\n rjr nabisco inc. said it agreed to sell its baby ruth <unk> and <unk> candy businesses to nestle s.a. 's nestle foods unit for $ N million \r\n the sale at a higher price than some analysts had expected helps the food and tobacco giant raise funds to pay debt and boosts nestle 's N N share of the u.s. candy market to about N N \r\n the candy businesses had sales of about $ N million last year which was roughly N N of total revenue for rjr 's <unk> <unk> unit according to a memorandum distributed by rjr 's owner kohlberg kravis roberts & co. to bankers last december \r\n the nestle acquisition includes a candy plant in franklin park ill. which employs about N workers \r\n the sale which had been expected is part of kkr 's program to pay down $ N billion of a $ N billion bridge loan by february \r\n roughly $ N billion of that debt has already been repaid from previous asset sales and rjr expects to use another $ N billion from the pending two-part sale of most of its del monte unit \r\n that sale however could still fall through if financing problems develop \r\n thus it remains crucial for rjr to obtain top dollar for its smaller assets like the candy brands \r\n louis <unk> jr. chairman and chief executive officer of new york-based rjr called the sale a significant step in the company 's divestiture program as well as a a strategic divestiture \r\n since kkr bought rjr in february for $ N billion of debt it has agreed to sell nearly $ N billion of rjr assets \r\n rjr 's executives have said they will <unk> with certain brands in particular that are n't leaders in their markets \r\n rjr nabisco and <unk> <unk> will concentrate more on our own core businesses mr. <unk> said friday \r\n baby ruth and <unk> are both among the <unk> N <unk> bars in the u.s. but rjr 's overall share of the roughly $ N billion market is less than N N \r\n nestle 's share of N N before friday 's purchases is far below the shares of market leaders <unk> foods corp. and <unk> inc. which have about N N and N N of the market respectively \r\n this means nestle is now in the <unk> business in a big way said <unk> <unk> publisher of <unk> <unk> <unk> magazine \r\n for them it makes all kinds of sense \r\n they 've been given a mandate from switzerland to expand their u.s. <unk> operations \r\n nestle s.a. is based in <unk> switzerland \r\n the new candy bars make an important contribution to our nestle foods commitment to this very important strategic unit said c. alan macdonald president of nestle foods in purchase n.y \r\n aetna life & casualty co. 's third-quarter net income fell N N to $ N million or $ N a share reflecting the damages from hurricane hugo and lower results for some of the company 's major divisions \r\n catastrophe losses reduced aetna 's net income by $ N million including $ N million from hugo \r\n last year catastrophe losses totaled $ N million when net was $ N million or $ N a share \r\n the year-earlier results have been restated to reflect an accounting change \r\n the insurer has started processing claims from the northern california earthquake nearly two weeks ago \r\n but because these claims are more difficult to evaluate and have been coming in more slowly the company has no estimate of the impact of the earthquake on fourth-quarter results \r\n in new york stock exchange composite trading friday aetna closed at $ N down N cents \r\n in the latest quarter aetna had a $ N million loss on its <unk> line compared with earnings of $ N million last year \r\n profit for its commercial insurance division fell N N to $ N million reflecting higher catastrophe losses and the price war in the property\\/casualty market for nearly three years \r\n however aetna 's employee benefits division which includes its group health insurance operations posted a N N profit gain to $ N million \r\n third-quarter results included net realized capital gains of $ N million which included $ N million from the sale of federated investors in august and a $ N million tax credit \r\n in the nine months net rose N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share last year \r\n out of the <unk> of <unk> are coming words of <unk> \r\n here at a <unk> stadium near the black township of <unk> yesterday were eight leaders of the african national congress seven of whom had spent most of their adult lives in prison for sabotage and conspiracy to <unk> the government \r\n here were more than N anc supporters gathering for the first anc rally inside south africa since the black liberation movement was banned in N \r\n here was the state security <unk> poised to <unk> on any words or acts of <unk> let alone revolution \r\n but the words that <unk> over the <unk> <unk> messages of peace unity negotiation and discipline \r\n we stand for peace today and we will stand for peace tomorrow said walter sisulu the anc 's former secretary general who along with five of his colleagues served N years in prison before being released two weeks ago \r\n some members of the huge crowd shouted <unk> peace <unk> \r\n these are <unk> times in south african politics \r\n the government and the anc the <unk> of enemies are engaged in an elaborate <unk> dance designed to <unk> each other to the negotiating table \r\n pretoria releases the anc leaders most of whom were serving life sentences and allows them to speak freely hoping that the anc will abandon its use of violence \r\n the anc leaders speak in <unk> of <unk> <unk> discipline hoping the government will be encouraged to take further steps such as <unk> nelson <unk> the most prominent anc figure and <unk> the organization \r\n the government of president <unk> de <unk> is using this situation to improve its international image and head off further economic sanctions \r\n meanwhile the many organizations inside the country that back the anc are taking the opportunity to regain their strength and <unk> their supporters even though the state of emergency which has severely curtailed black opposition remains in force \r\n the result is that the <unk> and <unk> are happening \r\n six months ago government approval for an anc rally was <unk> \r\n equally <unk> is that the anc given the chance to hold a rally would extend a hand <unk> <unk> to the government \r\n in a message read out at the rally <unk> anc president oliver <unk> who ca n't legally be quoted in south africa said the country was at a <unk> and that mr. de <unk> may yet earn a place among the <unk> of our country if he chooses a path of genuine political settlement \r\n still this does n't mean that either the government or the anc is changing <unk> or that either has moved significantly closer to the other \r\n the government may ease repression in some areas but it still keeps a tight grip in others \r\n for instance it releases mr. sisulu without conditions yet his son <unk> a newspaper editor is restricted to his home much of the day and is n't allowed to work as a journalist \r\n the anc <unk> to keep up pressure on the government \r\n <unk> yesterday called on foreign governments to increase sanctions against pretoria and urged supporters inside the country to continue <unk> emergency restrictions and racial <unk> known as apartheid \r\n we can not wait on the government to make changes at its own pace mr. sisulu said \r\n because the anc remains banned both the government which approved the rally and the <unk> who <unk> it denied it was an anc rally \r\n they both called it a welcome home gathering \r\n nevertheless an anc rally by any other name is still an anc rally \r\n the recently released leaders sat high <unk> a <unk> in one section of the stadium stands \r\n behind them was a huge anc flag and an even bigger sign that said anc lives anc leads \r\n next to them was the red flag of the outlawed south african communist party which has long been an anc ally \r\n in the stands people <unk> anc flags wore anc <unk> sang anc <unk> and <unk> anc <unk> \r\n today said mr. sisulu the anc has captured the center stage of political life in south africa \r\n as a police helicopter <unk> overhead mr. sisulu repeated the anc 's demands on the government to create a climate for negotiations release all political <unk> <unk> lift all bans and restrictions on individuals and organizations remove all troops from the black <unk> end the state of emergency and cease all political trials and political executions \r\n if these conditions are met he said the anc would be prepared to discuss <unk> its guerrilla activities \r\n there can be no question of us <unk> abandoning the armed struggle he said \r\n to date we see no clear indication that the government is serious about negotiations \r\n all their <unk> are vague \r\n <unk> a phrase from mr. de <unk> mr. sisulu said let all of us who love this country engage in the task of building a new south africa \r\n when westinghouse electric corp. <unk> its massive steam <unk> plant in <unk> pa. three years ago it seemed like the company had pulled the plug on its <unk> power generation business \r\n but now westinghouse is enjoying a <unk> in demand for both steam and combustion <unk> and may even join the growing <unk> of independent electric producers \r\n and with its new venture with japan 's mitsubishi heavy industries ltd. announced last week it is poised to <unk> growing markets overseas \r\n for the first time since the mid-1970s westinghouse this year has seen a significant increase in orders for power plants \r\n most are from independent producers instead of regulated utilities and westinghouse believes it will ride a wave of demand stretching over the next six years \r\n analysts agree predicting that the revived market could significantly boost westinghouse 's bottom line in coming years \r\n westinghouse 's earnings could be <unk> enhanced in the mid-1990s or sooner says russell l. <unk> of salomon brothers inc \r\n the company expects a need for N <unk> of new generation in the u.s. over the next decade \r\n already this year it has received orders for four <unk> advanced combustion <unk> from florida power & light co. and for two <unk> plants from <unk> energy corp. among others \r\n westinghouse 's own role as a supplier also is changing \r\n in the past the company usually took <unk> equity positions in power plants it supplied as a <unk> to close deals \r\n but last june 's <unk> that westinghouse would put up all of the $ N million to build a new <unk> plant could herald a new age \r\n westinghouse 's plant will provide electrical power to the southern california edison co. and backup power and steam to the u.s. <unk> & chemical co \r\n we have n't decided on a strategy yet but we could become an independent producer depending on whether we 're the developer or just the supplier says <unk> stern executive vice president of the company 's energy and utility systems group \r\n at the same time westinghouse hopes its venture with mitsubishi will help fend off growing competition particularly in the u.s. from such european competitors as asea brown boveri ag siemens ag and british general electric co \r\n under the agreement westinghouse will be able to purchase smaller combustion <unk> from its japanese partner and package and sell them with its own <unk> and other equipment \r\n westinghouse also jointly will bid on projects with <unk> giving it an edge in developing asian markets \r\n in addition the two companies will develop new steam <unk> technology such as the plants ordered by florida power and even <unk> each other 's plants at times to take advantage of currency fluctuations \r\n even though we 'll still compete against mitsubishi we can also work jointly on some projects and we 'll gain a lot of <unk> flexibility mr. stern contends \r\n the <unk> venture was designed as a <unk> transaction <unk> any possible antitrust concerns \r\n westinghouse carefully <unk> the agreement because the justice department earlier this year successfully challenged a proposed steam <unk> joint venture with asea brown boveri \r\n it is expected that the current surge in demand for new power will be filled primarily by independent producers which unlike utilities are n't regulated and therefore do n't need government approval to construct new plants \r\n westinghouse expects about half of its new orders for <unk> to come from independent producers for at least the next six years \r\n despite <unk> of the company 's <unk> and east pittsburgh plants the company believes it has sufficient capacity to meet near-term demand with its much smaller and more efficient manufacturing facilities in north carolina \r\n still westinghouse acknowledges that demand from independent producers could <unk> if prices for fuel such as natural gas or oil rise sharply or if utilities which have been pressured by regulators to keep down rates are suddenly freed to add significant generating capacity \r\n even if that scenario occurs westinghouse figures it is prepared \r\n the company already is <unk> up for a renaissance of nuclear power even though it has n't received an order for a domestic nuclear plant in a decade \r\n john c. marous chairman and chief executive officer says he expects a commercial order by N for the company 's <unk> nuclear power plant which is under development \r\n once we see an order we expect it 'll be on line by N \r\n among the things i learned covering the world series these past few weeks is that the richter scale which measures earthquakes is n't like the one in your <unk> \r\n a quake that measures two on the richter is n't twice as severe as a one it 's N times worse \r\n a three is N times N again and so on \r\n that put the seven of oct. N in perspective for me \r\n think i 'll buy one of those i survived <unk> after all \r\n by <unk> standards the show that the oakland athletics put on friday and saturday nights in putting a <unk> swift end to the game 's longest short series rated somewhere between a N and an N \r\n the boys with the white <unk> on their <unk> might not have made the earth move much but they certainly did some impressive things with <unk> \r\n the pale <unk> propelled six of <unk> out of the unfriendly <unk> of candlestick park during the two games en route to N and N wins over the san francisco giants \r\n combined with their two <unk> victories way back on oct. N and N the scores were N and N remember that gave them a sweep of the <unk> series \r\n the joke here is that the giants lost by de fault \r\n that 's <unk> correct but a <unk> unfair otherwise \r\n they showed up but did n't or could n't challenge \r\n they led for <unk> an inning in the four games and managed to stir their fans only once \r\n that came in the seventh inning of game four when <unk> N they scored four times and brought their big heat will clark and kevin mitchell to the plate with one out and a <unk> on \r\n but clark <unk> out to short right field and mitchell 's drive to left was caught on the warning track by <unk> henderson as N sets of <unk> <unk> as one \r\n i went out to <unk> burns the a 's <unk> and told him that we were n't <unk> <unk> let this guy beat us said oakland <unk> terry <unk> of the decisive confrontation with mitchell the national league 's <unk> <unk> king \r\n i told him to make mitchell reach for everything and that 's what we did \r\n the ball he hit was n't a strike \r\n if it had been he <unk> hit it out \r\n but if the a 's had n't won in four they would have prevailed in five or six or seven \r\n the best team won this series which is more unusual than it may sound \r\n baseball ai n't football where the good teams beat up on the bad ones \r\n the best baseball teams win six of N games and the worst win four of N \r\n without becoming overly contentious allow me to suggest that several recent <unk> of the world according to us as in u.s. might not have ranked no. N in many polls \r\n that list includes last season 's <unk> the los angeles <unk> who rode a <unk> home run by kirk <unk> and two <unk> pitching performances by <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> over a <unk> bothered oakland crew \r\n these a 's however got few grades as low as b on their N report card \r\n they led the major <unk> in regular-season wins with N and <unk> the toronto blue <unk> four games to one for the american league <unk> before <unk> their <unk> rivals \r\n the <unk> testimony to their domination of the <unk> <unk> came from giants ' manager roger craig after his team had fallen in game three to a <unk> <unk> that tied a <unk> series record \r\n asked what he would do differently on the <unk> craig allowed that he might play his <unk> deeper maybe on the other side of the <unk> \r\n the a 's offensive showing in the series got an a as in <unk> \r\n their N total bases broke a record for a four-game set and their nine home runs tied one \r\n eight oakland players hit <unk> with <unk> dave henderson getting two both on friday \r\n <unk> henderson the <unk> <unk> man had nine hits and set or tied four-game series marks for <unk> N and stolen bases N \r\n the sole a not to homer was cleanup <unk> mark <unk> their regular-season leader with N and he contributed five hits plus a <unk> <unk> play on a ground ball in game three that stopped a giant rally while the issue still was in doubt \r\n think i 'll <unk> my image get this changed to a <unk> <unk> the big first <unk> saturday night <unk> the gold bat he wears on a neck chain \r\n even with that power show though the oakland series ' star certified by the most valuable player award was a <unk> dave stewart \r\n he shut out the giants on five hits in game one and allowed three runs on five hits in seven <unk> friday after the <unk> break caused by the earthquake \r\n stewart 's honor was a nice note on a couple of grounds \r\n one was that despite his N regular-season wins over the past three seasons in the land beyond the late news he has been <unk> by his <unk> <unk> and missed out on prizes that might have been his due \r\n the other is that he 's an oakland native and lifted residents ' spirits by his visits to <unk> areas last week \r\n afterward as the a 's <unk> their victory with beer they <unk> with traditional champagne <unk> in <unk> to the quake victims stewart said he thought his <unk> ring would <unk> his individual <unk> \r\n give me four or five more series with these guys and i do n't care if i ever win a <unk> young he said in reference to baseball 's <unk> award \r\n indeed the possibility of an a 's ring cycle <unk> a <unk> was a major topic of <unk> discussion saturday so much so that <unk> <unk> the team 's general manager felt obliged to <unk> it \r\n people change teams change he cautioned \r\n it 's easier to get worse than better in this game \r\n he might have added an interesting historical fact the last series sweep by the cincinnati <unk> came in N which also was the first year of baseball player free agency \r\n it was widely predicted that free agency would allow the glamorous big market teams to <unk> the best talent but quite the opposite has occurred twelve different clubs have won titles in the N seasons since its advent \r\n the number includes such <unk> <unk> as well oakland \r\n the rationale for responding to your customers ' needs faster than the competition can is clear your company will benefit in terms of market share customer satisfaction and profitability \r\n in fact managers today are probably more aware of speed as a competitive <unk> than ever before \r\n however for many managing speed does not come naturally \r\n most of us grew up <unk> in the <unk> <unk> makes waste and do n't cut corners ideas that seem to run counter to the concept of managing speed says dean <unk> vice president for product integrity at grumman corp \r\n but in the real world you learn that speed and quality are not a <unk> \r\n speed is a component of quality one of the things we must deliver to satisfy customers \r\n companies that actually market speed as part of their service train their managers to lead and participate in teams that increase speed and improve quality in everyday operations \r\n managers learn to spot opportunities to increase customer satisfaction through speed and shift some responsibility for analyzing improving and streamlining work processes from themselves to teams of employees \r\n one team at the federal express ground operations station in <unk> mass. focused on a particularly <unk> operation the morning package sort \r\n every morning <unk> trucks arrive at the <unk> ground station from boston 's <unk> airport carrying the day 's package load \r\n in peak periods that load may include N pieces \r\n the packages must be <unk> quickly and distributed to smaller vans for delivery so <unk> can be on the road by N \r\n no customer is present at the morning package sort but the process is nevertheless critical to customer satisfaction \r\n we 're committed to deliver the customer 's package by a stated time usually N notes glenn <unk> a federal express <unk> who led the <unk> team \r\n the sooner our vans hit the road each morning the easier it is for us to fulfill that obligation \r\n following a <unk> formula used by teams throughout federal express members of the <unk> team monitored their morning routine carefully noting where and when the work group 's resources were used effectively and where they were idle waiting for others <unk> in the process to send packages their way \r\n we suspected there was <unk> built into our process \r\n but we did n't know just where it was until we completed our data gathering mr. <unk> says \r\n we used the data to <unk> our <unk> system and put our resources where they could do the most good \r\n the team even created a points system to identify those <unk> and <unk> that were doing the most to reduce <unk> cycle time \r\n winners of the friendly competition earn a <unk> dinner out with their spouses \r\n monitoring shows that the <unk> team 's new system really does reduce cycle time for the morning package sort reports james <unk> chief operating officer at federal express \r\n the vans leave at least N minutes earlier on average than they used to \r\n and service levels have increased to the point where they 're consistently above N N \r\n a <unk> team at union carbide 's <unk> n.y. facility which produces <unk> plants followed a similar path to reduce manufacturing cycle time \r\n the team included <unk> from the shop floor as well as engineering scheduling and purchasing personnel reports alan <unk> director of quality \r\n first they produced a <unk> detailing the process by which an <unk> plant actually gets built \r\n then they identified <unk> in the process \r\n the <unk> team determined that <unk> for <unk> were the main problem and identified which kinds of delays involved critical <unk> and which were less critical or could be handled by workers already on the line \r\n the team then proposed modifications in their work process to management \r\n the <unk> manufacturing process benefits our customers in at least two ways mr. <unk> concludes \r\n first we have better quality assurance than ever because the people building the product have taken on more responsibility for the quality of their own work \r\n second we trimmed more than a month off the time required to deliver a finished product \r\n at grumman 's aircraft systems division a <unk> team reduced the cycle time required to produce a new business proposal for an important government contract \r\n the team was composed of representatives from engineering manufacturing corporate estimating flight test material quality control and other departments \r\n we needed contributions from all these departments to generate the proposal says carl <unk> <unk> manager for grumman 's <unk> combat aircraft program \r\n but instead of gathering their input <unk> we formed the team which reached consensus on the proposal objectives and produced a statement of work to guide all the functions that were involved \r\n armed with this shared understanding and <unk> background information each department developed its specialized contribution to the proposal <unk> data and cost estimates on a closely managed schedule \r\n we cleared up questions and <unk> very quickly because the people who had the skills and perspective required to resolve them were part of the task team mr. <unk> explains \r\n the team trimmed more than two months from the cycle time previously required to develop comparable proposals \r\n the team eliminated the crisis mentality that proposal deadlines can generate \r\n the result was a more <unk> complete and competitive proposal mr. <unk> concludes \r\n the successes achieved at federal express union carbide and grumman suggest that managing speed may be an <unk> source of competitive advantage \r\n managers in all three companies recognize speed as a component of quality and a key to customer satisfaction \r\n they effectively lead team efforts to reduce cycle time \r\n and they prepare all their people to increase the speed and improve the quality of their own work \r\n mr. <unk> is president of <unk> a consulting firm in burlington mass \r\n home taping of <unk> music cuts into record industry revenues but banning home taping would hurt consumers even more \r\n that 's the conclusion of an independent report prepared by the office of technology assessment at the request of the house and senate judiciary committees \r\n the report is to be released today \r\n the report says the availability of such advanced <unk> recording equipment as <unk> recorders does n't seem to increase the quantity of home copying \r\n that finding the report says <unk> doubt on the record industry 's <unk> that the new generation of digital recording equipment will inevitably lead to wholesale abuse of <unk> material by home <unk> \r\n the longstanding position of the recording industry association of america a trade group based in washington d.c. is that record companies performers <unk> and music publishers need to be <unk> by <unk> fees on the sale of blank tapes and recording equipment to make up for royalties lost to home taping \r\n i think it is a <unk> in the <unk> in any royalty tax proposal says gary shapiro vice president for government and legal affairs of the electronic industries association in washington \r\n what the report shows is everything we 've been saying for the past eight or nine years that audio taping is the best thing to happen for the recording industry \r\n the people who tape the most buy the most \r\n <unk> <unk> a <unk> for <unk> says her organization has n't received a copy of the completed report yet and has no immediate comment \r\n a recent agreement between the recording industry and electronics manufacturers requires that any digital audio tape or <unk> recorder sold in the u.s. have a <unk> device that restricts its ability to make second copies from <unk> tape copies of digital compact disks \r\n but the disappointing sales of <unk> machines here and abroad so far have not seemed to warrant the three years of legal <unk> that went into the agreement \r\n under current copyright laws it is considered fair use to <unk> <unk> material for one 's personal use or for use by one 's family or friends while copying for purposes of resale or profit is prohibited \r\n a survey contained in the <unk> report copyright and home copying technology challenges the law found that most people consider home copying for such personal use a right a right moreover that was exercised by N N of americans over the age of N in the past year \r\n the study says that the <unk> legal status of home copying makes it appropriate to examine the effects on consumers as well as on industry \r\n reports by the office of technology assessment do n't <unk> any specific legislative action but suggest a range of options that congress may pursue \r\n the study also says that advent of new communications technologies makes an explicit congressional definition of the legal status of home copying more desirable in order to reduce legal and market uncertainties and to prevent de <unk> changes to copyright law through technology and says that finding an appropriate balance of <unk> and benefits is a political decision not a technical one \r\n switzerland 's most famous raider says he is n't one \r\n werner k. rey believes fortunes are made by being friendly \r\n and in little more than a decade of being friendly and at the same time <unk> the <unk> swiss business community with some <unk> <unk> and dealing the <unk> mr. rey has grown from a modest banker to a billionaire \r\n he achieved this in part with an <unk> talent for getting his foot <unk> in the door of established european companies \r\n his latest coup september 's <unk> of the five billion <unk> $ N billion merger between <unk> s.a. the world 's second-largest temporary employment agency and <unk> international s.a. a <unk> <unk> company \r\n shareholders must approve the merger at general meetings of the two companies in late november \r\n but approval is almost certain since mr. rey and a friendly <unk> management are in control \r\n after the transaction mr. rey estimates the value of his N N stake in the new company to be held by his omni holding ag will be about N billion swiss francs \r\n this will be his return on an original investment of between N million swiss francs and N million swiss francs \r\n mr. rey bought a controlling stake in <unk> for N million swiss francs in N building up the <unk> engineering company with european and u.s. acquisitions \r\n i like to succeed says mr. rey during a recent morning of working at home which he also likes \r\n home is an estate with green <unk> opening onto lake geneva and a <unk> house whose rooms <unk> the water and offer a view of the french <unk> \r\n in the corner of his reception room is a delicate <unk> desk <unk> high with <unk> \r\n there is a small <unk> on the wall \r\n <unk> magazine <unk> lists mr. rey as having a fortune of about N billion swiss francs \r\n writes <unk> no one in switzerland ever came so far so fast \r\n he was simply the first in this country to realize that <unk> were just lying around waiting to be picked up \r\n in short rey found companies with weak earnings but rich assets \r\n however the swiss financial press in general as well as many analysts have had a hard time making up their minds about mr. rey and his <unk> ways \r\n for switzerland 's most prestigious newspaper <unk> <unk> <unk> mr. rey seems <unk> to remain the former bally raider an image that has proved hard to overcome \r\n in N as an <unk> in the eyes of switzerland 's establishment mr. rey laid the foundations of his <unk> <unk> with an <unk> <unk> on bally the country 's traditional <unk> \r\n sitting <unk> a banker at a <unk> in london where he was working as a financial consultant he learned that a large <unk> of bally 's shares was up for sale \r\n looking into bally he could hardly believe what he saw a company with enormous real-estate holdings in major european cities and a market capitalization of N million swiss francs it had N employees \r\n investing four million swiss francs earned from his financial transactions and two million swiss francs from his parents and his wife mr. rey acquired N N of bally 's shares \r\n but such tactics were <unk> to switzerland in N and still are n't common because of share restrictions that companies are allowed to maintain \r\n eventually mr. rey was forced to sell his bally shares to the weapons maker <unk> holding ag as establishment pressure grew on this hostile move into the swiss old boys ' network \r\n mr. rey made N million swiss francs on the sale \r\n bally was not an unfriendly takeover he insists \r\n buying from willing shareholders makes an unfriendly takeover impossible mr. rey contends \r\n i bought from willing shareholders \r\n nevertheless mr. rey has been very careful since then to make sure his moves are welcome \r\n and he has worked to shed his raider image \r\n in N his career as an <unk> began with the acquisition of the swiss metals works <unk> based in <unk> \r\n with the <unk> metals business undermined in switzerland by tough foreign competition and high domestic costs this looked like a <unk> undertaking \r\n but mr. rey brought about a merger in the next few years between the country 's major producers the increased efficiency has <unk> up the industry \r\n three years later machinery producer <unk> de <unk> <unk> de <unk> s.a. was to become part of the rey empire \r\n once again the company 's future looked less than <unk> \r\n but after restructuring under new management the profits began rolling in \r\n a major boost to mr. rey 's respectability among the swiss came in N when he sold N N of his <unk> bank to the conservative swiss <unk> banks \r\n they renamed it swiss <unk> and are using it to expand abroad \r\n in N mr. rey <unk> leading publishing houses to take over switzerland 's jean <unk> ag a major producer of magazines and newspapers \r\n and with the recent acquisition of N N of <unk> machinery manufacturer <unk> <unk> ag mr. rey has enjoyed the status of white knight \r\n <unk> preferred him to financier <unk> <unk> whose <unk> <unk> on the company 's stock had led to a bitter battle \r\n meanwhile as such strategic investments have mounted the <unk> arm of mr. rey 's omni holding has been <unk> buying and selling dozens of companies often after a financial or corporate restructuring \r\n today this branch of mr. rey 's empire runs under the name <unk> offering services and handles mergers and acquisitions placement of securities and real estate \r\n in its portfolio are such diverse companies as united <unk> air europe <unk> inc. a u.s. company that makes supermarket <unk> machines <unk> industries a u.s. manufacturer of securities systems <unk> systems inc. a u.s. regional telephone company and major real-estate projects in the u.s. and europe \r\n for financial analysts reading omni

the basis of their real-estate interests \r\n in august omni unexpectedly bought <unk> 's N N stake in <unk> ag of west germany a <unk> company \r\n the internal transaction within the rey empire <unk> <unk> 's small shareholders but analysts say it makes sense for <unk> to focus on its main businesses of product inspection and temporary help \r\n mr. rey says the move is yet another example of his <unk> \r\n he explains that companies with real estate give security \r\n the real estate can be used he points out as guarantees for bank loans for corporate development \r\n he says he wants to influence but not manage companies \r\n i do n't want to be like financier alan bond and the other <unk> \r\n i do n't want companies to be built around me as a person \r\n i want them to stand

\r\n in the second step of a reorganization that began earlier this year boeing co. said it will create a defense and space group to consolidate several divisions \r\n meanwhile boeing officials and representatives of the machinists union met separately last night with a federal mediator in an attempt to break the <unk> strike that has shut the aerospace giant 's assembly lines at a time when it has an $ N billion backlog of jetliner orders \r\n the two sides were scheduled to meet with the mediator this morning \r\n machinists already have rejected a package that would provide a N N pay raise plus bonuses over the three-year life of the contract \r\n boeing has said repeatedly it wo n't expand its offer and the machinists have responded that the offer is n't good enough \r\n however the resolve of some of the striking N machinists might be weakening \r\n about N <unk> signed <unk> last week calling for boeing and machinists representatives to schedule new meetings \r\n the two sides had n't met since oct. N \r\n while boeing 's commercial business is booming its military business is feeling the effects of a declining defense budget after a strong buildup during the reagan presidency \r\n in may the company consolidated its aerospace and electronics groups the new defense and space group will contain the aerospace and electronics division and advanced systems both based in the seattle area boeing <unk> in philadelphia boeing military airplanes in wichita kan. and <unk> in sunnyvale calif \r\n b. dan <unk> president of boeing aerospace and electronics will become president of the new group which will become operational jan.

's announcement friday of a $ N million loss for the third quarter showed that the company is moving even faster than expected to take write-offs on its various problems and prepare for a turnaround next year \r\n at the same time the sheer size of the loss coupled with a slowing of orders made some securities analysts wonder just how strong that turnaround will be at the computer maker and <unk> concern \r\n unisys is getting clobbered \r\n just clobbered said <unk> weil an analyst at weil & associates who had once been high on the company \r\n the quarter was terrible and the future looks anything but encouraging \r\n unisys whose revenue inched up N N in the quarter to $ N billion from $ N billion in the year-earlier quarter had an operating loss of about $ N million \r\n on top of that the blue bell pa. concern took a $ N million charge related to the layoffs of N employees \r\n that is at the high end of the range of N to N employees that unisys said a month ago would be laid off \r\n unisys said that should help it save $ N million a year in costs again at the high end of the previously reported range of $ N million to $ N million \r\n the company also took a write-off of $ N million to cover losses on some fixed-price defense contracts as some new managers took a hard look at the prospects for that <unk> business \r\n in addition unisys set up an unspecified reserve apparently $ N million to $ N million to cover the minimum amount it will have to pay the government because of its involvement in the <unk> scandal \r\n unisys also noted that it paid $ N million in taxes during the quarter even though tax payments normally would be minimal in a quarter that produced such a big loss \r\n the tax payments will leave unisys with $ N million in loss <unk> that will cut tax payments in future quarters \r\n in addition unisys said it reduced computer inventories a further $ N million during the quarter leaving it within $ N million of its goal of a reduction of $ N million by the end of the year \r\n still unisys said its european business was weak during the quarter a worrisome sign given that the company has relied on solid results overseas to overcome weakness in the u.s. over the past several quarters \r\n the company also reported slower growth in another important business systems that use the unix operating system \r\n that would be a huge problem if it were to continue because unisys is betting its business on the assumption that customers want to move away from using operating systems that run on only one manufacturer 's equipment and toward systems mainly unix that work on almost anyone 's machines \r\n in addition unisys must deal with its increasingly <unk> debt load \r\n debt has risen to around $ N billion or about N N of total capitalization \r\n that means unisys must pay about $ N million in interest every quarter on top of $ N million in dividends on preferred stock \r\n jim <unk> unisys 's president said he is approaching next year with caution \r\n he said the strength of the world-wide economy is suspect and does n't see much revenue growth in the cards \r\n he also said that the price wars <unk> up in parts of the computer industry will continue through next year \r\n he said the move toward standard operating systems means customers are n't locked into buying from their traditional computer supplier and can force prices down \r\n that he said is why unisys is <unk> its whole business it needs to prepare for a world in which profit margins will be lower than computer companies have been used to \r\n we 've approached this not as a response to a temporary condition in the industry but as a fundamental change the industry is going through mr. <unk> said \r\n the <unk> industry is still going to be a <unk> business and we 're confident that we have tremendous assets as a company \r\n but we do n't minimize the challenges of the near term \r\n securities analysts were even more cautious having been burned repeatedly on unisys this year \r\n some had predicted earnings of more than $ N a share for this year up from last year 's fully diluted $ N a share on earnings of $ N million \r\n but the company said friday that it had losses of $ N million through the first nine months compared with earnings a year earlier of $ N million or $ N a share fully diluted as revenue inched up N N to $ N billion from $ N billion \r\n and unisys is expected to do little better than break even in the fourth quarter \r\n so steve <unk> at first boston said he is cutting his earnings estimate for next year to $ N a share from $ N \r\n i was feeling like i was too high to begin with he said \r\n mr. weil of weil & associates said he will remain at $ N a share for next year but said he <unk> whether even that low target is at risk \r\n the break-even point for next year is much lower but is it low enough he asked \r\n reflecting the concern unisys stock fell a further N cents to $ N in composite trading friday on the new york stock exchange \r\n if a tv <unk> gets <unk> facing the camera again after a questionable forecast donald h. straszheim surely understands \r\n the chief economist of merrill lynch & co. finds himself in such a position as he <unk> the midwest on his first road trip since <unk> on a major prediction \r\n mr. straszheim expects he will take some heat and he 's right \r\n since the last time he traveled this way several months ago he has <unk> a series of bold forecasts of a recession \r\n in february N for example merrill lynch 's weekly commentary announced that the economy is likely to fall into recession in early N \r\n the forecasts were widely <unk> and in a <unk> ad campaign launched in the summer of N merrill lynch urged investors to buy bonds \r\n it said long-term interest rates then above N N could drop to N N by the end of N so bonds which benefit from falling rates would be a good buy \r\n the firm also raised the percentage of bonds in its model portfolio from N N to N N and later to N N \r\n but this september just when many market economists including some at merrill lynch believed that mr. straszheim was about to be proved right he took a <unk> if not a <unk> \r\n he <unk> the talk about a recession \r\n now in fact he is predicting economic growth of N N this year and N N next year a more optimistic outlook than the consensus of some four dozen top <unk> surveyed by blue chip economic indicators newsletter \r\n and just recently merrill lynch cut the recommended <unk> back to N N \r\n while such changes might sound minor they are n't merrill lynch manages or oversees some $ N billion in retail accounts that include everything from mutual funds to individual annuities \r\n two well-known colleagues who believe mr. straszheim was right the first time are david <unk> jr. and a. gary <unk> both of whom run their own new york research firms \r\n mr. <unk> said in august that his <unk> index signaled recession \r\n mr. <unk> who was merrill lynch 's chief economist from N to N has <unk> a recession for months \r\n my own personal opinion is that don threw in the towel just about the time he should have doubled his bet he says \r\n now a rocky stock market and weak corporate profits may further threaten the economy \r\n and mr. straszheim conceded after a recent drop in manufacturing jobs that it may prove to be the case that we got <unk> that we pulled the recession forecast at just the wrong time \r\n he adds that 's the forecasting business \r\n however risky the business it 's brisk these days \r\n <unk> by bosses brokers clients and media people and pushed by their own <unk> wall street economists are forecasting about everything from broad economic trends to the <unk> monthly indicator \r\n but the surprisingly durable seven-year economic expansion has made <unk> of more than one forecast \r\n this is n't the quiet economic science practiced in the universities \r\n this is the commercial version \r\n carrying the new message on the road mr. straszheim meets confrontation that often occurs in <unk> proportion to the size of the client \r\n no sophisticated professional expects economists to be right all the time \r\n some smaller clients do n't seem to notice his switch \r\n but with some clients the talk can heat up a bit \r\n dennis o'brien the treasurer of commonwealth edison co. in chicago <unk> a <unk> approach waiting for an opportunity to ask about the forecast \r\n a good half-hour into breakfast at the palmer house mr. o'brien looks up from his plate after mr. straszheim says something about people who believe interest rates are about to <unk> \r\n i 'm one of them who hope they will with $ N billion in debt on the books \r\n is that the forecast mr. o'brien asks trying to <unk> down the economist \r\n he does n't fully succeed although mr. straszheim lists an array of interest-rate scenarios \r\n in a <unk> conference room at alliance capital management in minneapolis in contrast the firm 's money managers seem ready to <unk> mr. straszheim to the wall \r\n alfred harrison the manager <unk> mr. straszheim 's <unk> back at him do we want to go through this \r\n or can we ask you why you changed your forecast just when it 's about to be right \r\n <unk> in his chair mr. straszheim replies that the new outlook though still weak does n't justify calling a recession right now \r\n it 's all in this <unk> you do n't want to look at \r\n we could still have a recession at some point \r\n one of mr. straszheim 's <unk> themes is that the state of the economy is n't a simple black or white \r\n sometimes like now it 's gray \r\n this <unk> assessment moves one alliance portfolio manager to ask so what is this a <unk> recession \r\n another challenges merrill lynch 's bond recommendation last year \r\n we 're not running that ad campaign any more mr. straszheim <unk> in a rare show of <unk> \r\n he adds i think it was a fairly decent call \r\n explaining his change of mind mr. straszheim says later it 's hard to <unk> this on one factor \r\n he says the economy and especially the employment numbers look much better than he expected interest rates have generally declined inflation has n't run <unk> \r\n our business is constantly looking at all these things he says \r\n his new forecast calls for a soft landing \r\n and it may be right judging from last week 's report that inflation-adjusted gross national product rose at a N N annual rate in the third quarter \r\n mr. <unk> understands mr. straszheim 's problems \r\n there 's <unk> pressure on economists to forecast these numbers he says \r\n you make a forecast and then you become its prisoner \r\n it is indeed hard to back away from a widely publicized forecast and mr. straszheim is <unk> with the <unk> on this trip \r\n his approach to the <unk> is direct but <unk> \r\n for some time we had forecast negative third and fourth-quarter growth \r\n we pulled that forecast he begins <unk> in a meeting with <unk> <unk> & <unk> inc. officials in minneapolis the first stop \r\n crane co. said it holds an N N stake in milton roy corp. an <unk> maker and may seek control of the company \r\n crane a maker of engineered products for aerospace construction defense and other uses made the disclosure in a securities and exchange commission filing \r\n in the filing crane said that in the past it considered seeking control of milton roy of st. <unk> fla. through a merger or tender offer and that it expects to continue to evaluate an acquisition from time to time \r\n crane officials did n't return phone calls seeking comment \r\n crane holds N milton roy shares including N bought from sept. N to thursday for $ N to $ N each \r\n in new york stock exchange composite trading friday milton roy shares leaped $ N to $ N each while crane sank $ N to $ N a share \r\n john m. <unk> chief financial officer of milton roy said the company has no comment on crane 's filing \r\n milton roy recently <unk> off unsolicited <unk> from <unk> <unk> corp. a <unk> mass. maker of <unk> products \r\n milton roy disclosed in may that it was approached for a possible acquisition by <unk> <unk> which agreed to purchase milton roy 's <unk> line for $ N million in february \r\n <unk> <unk> acquired some N N of milton roy 's common stock before throwing in the towel and reducing its stake in early september \r\n <unk> group began raising its milton roy stake in july and holds N N

its sister operation environmental testing co. in <unk> <unk> \r\n the companies are <unk> concerns \r\n under the terms milton roy will pay an initial $ N million for the operations and additional payments during the next four years based on the earnings performance of the businesses \r\n in the nine months milton roy earned $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N million \r\n last week the british displayed unusual political <unk> \r\n the chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson resigned because prime minister thatcher would not fire her trusted adviser sir alan walters \r\n the opposition labor party leader neil <unk> in a display of the male <unk> typical of the british lower class denounced mrs. thatcher for having an independent mind and refusing to <unk> the men in her cabinet \r\n the british press making a mountain out of a <unk> <unk> an unnecessary economic crisis by portraying mrs. thatcher as an <unk> who had thrown economic policy into confusion by driving a respected figure from her government \r\n behind the silly <unk> lies a real dispute \r\n mr. lawson and his <unk> colleagues want the british pound formally tied to the west german mark \r\n sir alan considers this an <unk> and costly policy \r\n as there is an effort to <unk> the dollar either to gold or other currencies the dispute is worth <unk> \r\n until his resignation mr. lawson had been conducting british monetary policy as if the pound were tied to the mark \r\n when mrs. thatcher cut the top tax rate to N N mr. lawson flooded the country with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark \r\n as a result he <unk> the inflation that mrs. thatcher through a long and costly effort had subdued \r\n with inflation surging the pound began falling against the mark \r\n to keep the exchange rate pegged mr. lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to N N \r\n this doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that mrs. thatcher 's policies had created producing widespread <unk> and pushing labor ahead in the polls \r\n instead of <unk> his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both british economic policy and mrs. thatcher 's political fortune mr. lawson pushed for <unk> the pound formally to the mark by entering the european monetary system which subordinates all member currencies to german monetary policy \r\n this put mrs. thatcher in a <unk> \r\n the concept of european integration is one of those grand schemes that appeal to intellectuals the media and the <unk> but are full of practical <unk> \r\n if the pound had been tied to the mark the british would have been unable to cut their <unk> tax rates \r\n the reason is simple \r\n when a country cuts tax rates it makes itself more attractive to investors and drives up the value of its currency \r\n it was fear of disturbing ems exchange-rate relationships that caused the <unk> government in france to be <unk> about cutting tax rates \r\n <unk> <unk> the finance minister at the time was sold on the <unk> policy but was concerned that his government would be criticized as <unk> for disturbing the linked european currency relationship \r\n the price of attracting capital whether one 's own or that of foreigners is a trade deficit \r\n to avoid this deficit mr. lawson inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise \r\n this <unk> policy could not prevent a british trade deficit \r\n consequently mr. lawson <unk> mrs. thatcher with a record trade deficit renewed inflation and high interest rates three political failures in a row \r\n little wonder that mrs. thatcher 's opponents were so anxious to keep mr. lawson in office \r\n it is extraordinary that the british treasury thought it could prevent a trade deficit by <unk> the pound \r\n the british <unk> statistics show that after the top tax rate was cut to N N the flow abroad of british capital slowed to N billion pounds $ N billion at the current rate in N from N billion pounds in N \r\n this change in the british capital account required an offsetting change in the trade account a change that could not be prevented by <unk> the currency \r\n nigel lawson was a victim of the <unk> confusion in thought that has been characteristic of western financial circles during the 1980s \r\n the most important governments have ignored the role of low tax rates in attracting real capital investment instead <unk> financial flows in response to high interest rates \r\n this has led them in a <unk> and <unk> policy circle \r\n first comes monetary expansion to drive down the currency 's value that was pushed up by <unk> reduction \r\n then when the currency falls interest rates are raised to attract financial flows in order to stabilize the exchange rate \r\n this policy is totally <unk> and sir alan is correct to point out its deficiencies \r\n britain and all of europe need to reconsider the prospects for european integration in light of the

september to a $ N trillion rate but would have climbed N N had it not been for the storm \r\n among the economic effects of the hurricane was a sharp drop in rental income \r\n the figures came a day after the government released a report showing that consumer spending propelled u.s. economic expansion in the third quarter while on an inflation-adjusted basis business investment slowed government spending declined and exports were flat \r\n but the new statistics show that by september the burst in spending seemed to be <unk> off \r\n many economists expect the weakness to continue \r\n i

\r\n perhaps it 's entertaining for those like you to discount the concerns of environmentalists suggesting that their <unk> initiatives are <unk> and referring to so many citizens as <unk> activists \r\n strange that we do n't hear similar criticisms of the east coast activists who seek to clean up boston harbor or rid their <unk> of medical waste \r\n while there are no easy low-cost solutions simply ignoring our problems will result in their <unk> increasing and spreading throughout the state the nation and the world \r\n if nothing else such initiatives as these will provide an awareness

N mr. semel <unk> and <unk> me and expressed <unk> that we had finally realized our long-term <unk> of running and having an equity position in a major entertainment company \r\n mr. guber says he brought to lunch a release document warner had agreed to in N when he and mr. peters made an aborted bid to buy part of mgm\\/ua entertainment co. to run the mgm studio \r\n mr. guber says he had crossed out mgm with a red <unk> and written in columbia giving the document to mr. semel \r\n mr. semel said absolutely nothing to indicate warner would have any <unk> to our assuming management positions at columbia mr. guber says \r\n mr. semel in his affidavit does n't mention any <unk> or <unk> \r\n he says he told mr. guber he could n't sign any documents and that the deal although apparently a good one for him and mr. peters would have a very negative impact on warner \r\n he said he would contact mr. ross and warner brothers chairman robert daly and that in a conference call the three agreed they could n't let the producers out of their contract \r\n mr. ross in his own affidavit says he and mr. daly instructed mr. semel to tell the producers warner would n't terminate their agreement \r\n mr. guber says that mr. semel did convey that information and that mr. semel said mr. ross was crazy because of the time deal meaning mr. guber says that mr. ross did not want to <unk> to his new merger partner time inc. that warner 's agreements provided for our departure under these circumstances \r\n mr. guber also says in his affidavit that mr. daly told us that even if sony did not want us warner 's relationship with us already was <unk> damaged that there was no way to put the egg together and that it would sue sony for tons of money \r\n moreover mr. guber claims mr. semel told him that mr. ross probably would n't object if it were anybody other than sony \r\n but sony is a problem \r\n the guber-peters side has said warner is particularly concerned about the prospect of a huge japanese company controlling important segments of the u.s. entertainment business \r\n some in hollywood suggest mr. guber and mr. peters took encouragement from warner studio executives such as mr. semel and mr. canton too literally \r\n according to this theory warner executives hoping to strengthen their relationships with the producers encouraged mr. guber and mr. peters in their ambitions to build a major entertainment company \r\n but the warner executives in their affidavits deny ever telling the producers they could get out of their written contract \r\n mr. <unk> the warner attorney says the studio still wants the producers to come back and fulfill their contract \r\n they are like a <unk> they have N projects in development for warner he says \r\n but mr. guber indicates in his affidavit that not all of the projects will be used \r\n for example he says that since N he and mr. peters have developed over N movie projects and warner has passed or chosen not to produce at least N \r\n as for the projects remaining at warner mr. guber says mr. semel informed me that warner 's producers have already started a feeding frenzy for our projects \r\n <unk> <unk> co. said it has acquired a georgia cable television company and a massachusetts publishing firm \r\n terms on both deals were n't disclosed \r\n the media company said it purchased cable usa inc. a privately held cable television system in <unk> county ga. a suburb of atlanta \r\n the system is still under construction and will serve a market of N homes \r\n the company also has acquired <unk> publishers and distributors inc. a family owned producer and distributor of educational materials in <unk> mass \r\n despite politicians ' <unk> about the federal budget the government ended fiscal N with a $ N billion deficit about the same as the two previous years \r\n even white house budget director richard darman had trouble finding a silver <unk> in the report \r\n i <unk> you could say the good news is that the deficits are not heading up he said but you ca n't be satisfied with deficits at this level and we 're not \r\n the federal deficit was $ N billion in N and $ N billion in N \r\n the N deficit would have been nearly $ N billion larger had the government been able to spend as much as congress intended on cleaning up the thrift industry before the year ended on sept. N \r\n because the resolution trust corp could n't spend the money fast enough the savings-and-loan outlays were pushed into fiscal N \r\n nevertheless the N deficit still exceeded the $ N billion target set by the gramm-rudman deficit-reduction law by $ N billion a reminder of that law 's <unk> \r\n the law sets a deficit target of $ N billion for fiscal N \r\n a <unk> fight over cutting capital-gains taxes has slowed the progress of N deficit-reduction legislation almost to a halt triggering across-the-board spending cuts under the gramm-rudman law \r\n the white house and the democratic leadership in congress blame each other for turning capital-gains taxes into such a divisive issue this year \r\n neither side showed any sign of retreating \r\n meeting with reporters friday mr. darman again said he would rather live with across-the-board spending cuts than accept a deficit-reduction bill like the one passed by the house which would increase spending in future years \r\n <unk> the size of the deficits of the past few years the treasury report showed that for the first time interest paid on the public debt $ N billion exceeded spending on social security the single largest government program \r\n in all federal outlays amounted to $ N trillion in N up N N from the previous year the treasury said \r\n federal revenues rose N N to $ N billion \r\n the treasury said a surge in tax receipts noted earlier in the year did n't turn out to be quite as strong as it first appeared \r\n the treasury marked up its forecast by $ N million in july but that proved to be about $ N billion too optimistic \r\n the government ran a deficit of $ N billion in september compared with a surplus of $ N billion in september N \r\n outlays for the month totaled $ N billion up from $ N billion a year earlier \r\n the increase reflects spending on the s&l rescue as well as payroll and social security checks normally issued in october that were issued in september this year because oct.

if you find sound healthy companies in japan they are not for sale said george <unk> a <unk> at tokyo-based asia advisory services inc \r\n statistics on acquisitions by foreigners vary in detail because unlike sansui which is listed on the tokyo and osaka stock exchanges most of the japanese companies acquired by foreigners are privately held \r\n but by all accounts foreign companies have

japanese corporate attitudes <unk> most would-be <unk> \r\n usually when a japanese company is ready to sell it has few alternatives remaining and the grim <unk> of sansui 's directors at a joint news

other <unk> fields including laser disks or portable <unk> players \r\n sansui was late into the <unk> business and failed to branch into other new businesses \r\n as the yen soared in recent years sansui 's <unk> financial problems became a vicious circle \r\n while competitors moved production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of japanese factories sansui lacked the money to

original equipment maker basis for sale under other companies ' brand names \r\n he said polly peck will greatly expand sansui 's product line using sansui 's engineers to design the new products and will move sansui 's production of most products other than sophisticated audio gear offshore into polly peck 's own factories \r\n whatever capital it sansui needs so it can compete and become a totally global entity capable of competing with the best in the world that capital will be <unk> mr. <unk> said \r\n and while polly peck is n't <unk> the <unk> <unk> structure of sansui it is bringing in a former toshiba corp. executive as executive vice president and chief operating officer \r\n such risk taking is an everyday matter for the <unk> mr. <unk> who is N N owner of polly peck as well as its chairman \r\n he took polly peck once a small fabric <unk> and used it at as a base to build a conglomerate that has been doubling its profits annually since N \r\n in september it announced plans to acquire the <unk> business of rjr nabisco inc. 's del monte foods unit for # N million $ N million \r\n last month polly peck posted a N N jump in pretax profit for the first half to # N million from # N million on a N N rise in sales \r\n <unk> s. <unk> in london contributed to this article \r\n the bolstered cellular agreement between bellsouth corp. and lin broadcasting corp. carries heightened risks and could fail to fend off mccaw cellular communications inc. the rival suitor for lin \r\n moreover the amended pact shows how mccaw 's <unk> has pushed lin and bellsouth into a corner forcing huge debt on the proposed new company \r\n the debt estimated at $ N billion could mortgage the cellular company 's future earning power in order to <unk> some lin holders in the short term \r\n the plan still calls for lin to combine its cellular telephone properties with bellsouth 's and to spin off its broadcasting operations \r\n but under new terms of the agreement announced friday lin holders would receive a special cash dividend of $ N a share representing a payout of about $ N billion shortly before the proposed merger \r\n lin said it expects to borrow the money to pay the dividend but commitments from banks still have n't been obtained \r\n under previous terms holders would have received a dividend of only $ N a share \r\n in addition new york-based lin would exercise its right to buy out for $ N billion the N N equity interest of its partner metromedia co. in a new york cellular franchise \r\n that money also would have to be borrowed \r\n in effect mccaw has forced lin 's hand by bidding $ N billion for the stake earlier this month \r\n we 're taking on more debt than we would have liked to acknowledged michael <unk> lin 's vice president and treasurer \r\n although he expressed confidence that the proposed new company 's cash flow would be sufficient to cover interest payments on the debt he estimated that the company would n't be profitable until N or later \r\n analyst estimate the value of the bellsouth proposal at about $ N to $ N a share \r\n they value mccaw 's bid at $ N to $ N a share \r\n the previous bellsouth pact was valued at about $ N to $ N a share \r\n mccaw the largest provider of cellular telephone service in the u.s. already owns about N N of lin 's stock \r\n in response to bellsouth 's amended pact the <unk> wash. company extended its own offer to buy N million lin shares for $ N apiece which would give mccaw a N N controlling interest \r\n over the weekend mccaw continued to call for an auction of lin \r\n analysts said they expect mccaw to <unk> the bidding again \r\n this game is n't over yet said joel d. gross a vice president at donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities corp \r\n at some point it will become <unk> for one company \r\n but i do n't think we 're at that point yet \r\n under its revised proposal atlanta-based bellsouth would have a N N interest in the new cellular company and would be responsible for half of its debt \r\n to <unk> the pact further and to ease concerns of institutional investors bellsouth added a provision designed to give extra protection to holders if the regional bell company ever decides to buy the rest of the new cellular company \r\n the provision described as <unk> protection would require bellsouth to pay a price equivalent to what an outside party might have to pay \r\n mccaw 's bid also has a similar clause \r\n only mccaw 's proposal requires the company to begin an auction process in june N for remaining shares at <unk> prices \r\n to <unk> shareholders concerned about the long-term value of the company under the <unk> agreement bellsouth also agreed to pay as much as $ N a share or $ N million if after five years the trading value of the new cellular company is n't as high as the value that shareholders would have realized from the mccaw offer \r\n we 're very pleased with the new deal \r\n we did n't expect bellsouth to be so responsive said frederick a. <unk> president of <unk> asset management inc. which holds N lin shares \r\n bellsouth 's <unk> protection was flawed previously \r\n we think this is a superior deal to mccaw 's \r\n we 're surprised \r\n we did n't think a sleeping bell mentality would be willing to take on <unk> \r\n but kenneth leon a telecommunications analyst with bear stearns & co. finds the bellsouth proposal still flawed because the company does n't have to wait five years to begin buying more lin shares \r\n how many shares will be around in N he asked \r\n there 's nothing preventing bellsouth from buying up shares in the meanwhile \r\n bellsouth 's revised proposal surprised many industry analysts especially because of the company 's willingness to accept some <unk> of future earnings \r\n william o. <unk> president of the company 's bellsouth enterprises inc. unit said the revised agreement with lin would <unk> bellsouth earnings by about N N in both N and N and by significantly less thereafter \r\n indeed bellsouth 's cellular operations were among the first in the country to become profitable \r\n for N bellsouth earned $ N billion or $ N a share on revenue of $ N billion \r\n analysts were predicting N bellsouth earnings in the range of $ N a share or $ N billion but now those estimates are being scaled back \r\n in composite trading friday on the new york stock exchange bellsouth shares fell N cents to $ N \r\n in national over-the-counter trading lin shares soared $ N to closed at $ N while mccaw fell $ N a share to $ N \r\n the proposed <unk> cellular company including the newly acquired metromedia stake would give the new entity N million potential customers including about N million in the nation 's top N markets \r\n mr. leon of bear stearns speculated that mccaw in an attempt to buy time might consider filing an antitrust suit against bellsouth with the justice department and u.s. district judge harold greene who oversees enforcement of the consent <unk> that broke up the bell system in N \r\n indeed mccaw seemed to hint at that option in a brief statement \r\n urging lin directors to conduct a fair auction on a level playing field mccaw asked how well the public interest would be served with the bell operating companies controlling over N N of all cellular potential customers in the nation 's top N markets \r\n market makers in nasdaq over-the-counter stocks are adding their voices to the swelling chorus of complaints about program trading \r\n their <unk> however has a strong practical aspect program trading is hazardous to their <unk> \r\n the most controversial form of program trading stock-index arbitrage is making it tough for traders to make money declares robert <unk> head of otc trading at donaldson lufkin & jenrette \r\n stock-index arbitrage the computer-guided buying and selling of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from fleeting price discrepancies affects the otc market directly through the N stocks included in standard & poor 's 500-stock index \r\n the s&p N is often used in arbitrage strategies \r\n the portion of otc volume attributable to program trading is n't known as it is on the new york stock exchange where it amounted to more than N N in september \r\n estimates from traders put it at less than N N of nasdaq 's average daily volume of roughly N million shares \r\n other <unk> <unk> program trading also causes the nasdaq composite index to lose ground against other segments of the stock market \r\n because of program trading it is more difficult to trade many otc stocks without sharp price moves a condition known as <unk> \r\n moreover the price volatility that is <unk> by program trading is <unk> efforts to woo individual investors back to an otc market that <unk> misses them \r\n some of these problems are neither new nor unique to the otc market \r\n but the big often tumultuous slide in stock prices this month has turned some of those who have been <unk> from the practice against it \r\n peter dapuzzo head of retail equity trading at shearson lehman hutton acknowledges that he was n't troubled by program trading when it began in the <unk> bull market because it added liquidity and people were pleased to see stock prices rising \r\n we were n't as concerned until they became sell programs says mr. dapuzzo who now thinks it adds unnecessary volatility \r\n shearson lehman however <unk> program trades for clients \r\n merrill lynch goldman sachs and kidder peabody in addition to shearson do <unk> otc stocks \r\n shearson merrill lynch and goldman sachs say they do so only for customers however \r\n kidder peabody does program trading for its own as well as clients ' accounts \r\n of course there were sell programs in past years too but they seem to hurt market makers more painfully these days \r\n that 's largely because of defensive measures they adopted after the N crash when individual investors fled the market and trading activity <unk> \r\n market makers to cut costs slashed inventories of stocks they keep on hand to sell investors when other holders are n't selling \r\n and to protect their reduced capital investment from eroding further market makers became <unk> to lower price quotes when sell programs are in progress \r\n on days when prices are tumbling they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will \r\n in such an environment market makers can suffer huge losses both on trades made that day at steadily dropping prices and in the value of their inventories of shares \r\n it makes no sense for us to put money at risk when you know you 're going to lose says mr. <unk> of donaldson lufkin \r\n but this <unk> mr. <unk> says is creating liquidity problems in certain otc stocks \r\n it 's harder to sell stocks when the sell programs come in because some market makers do n't want to take the orders \r\n no one has big positions and no one wants to take big risks \r\n joseph <unk> president of the national association of securities dealers which oversees trading on nasdaq agrees that program trading is hurting the market 's efforts to bring back small investors \r\n but he observes while makers suffer losses when program trading <unk> the market down they also make money when program trading <unk> the prices higher \r\n sometimes traders lose sight of that he says \r\n the otc stocks in the s&p N include nasdaq 's biggest such as apple computer mci communications tele-communications and <unk> <unk> \r\n these big stocks greatly influence the nasdaq composite index \r\n when the computers say sell the composite <unk> as well as the dow jones industrial average \r\n the problem market makers say is that while the industrial average and the s&p N usually recover as buy programs kick in the nasdaq composite frequently is left behind \r\n eight trading days after oct. N the day before the stock market plunge for instance the nasdaq composite had fallen N N compared with N N for the s&p N N N for the new york stock exchange composite index and N N for the industrial average \r\n this gap eventually closes but slowly \r\n three days later as of friday 's close the nasdaq composite was down N N compared with N N for the industrial average N N for the s&p N and N N for the big board composite \r\n the main reason for this lag is that individual investors own N N of the otc market 's capitalization according to mr. <unk> much more than on the big board \r\n such investors tend to be more cautious than institutional investors are about <unk> the market after massive <unk> market makers say \r\n friday 's market activity \r\n the nasdaq composite index tumbled N or N N to N on friday \r\n for the week the index dropped N N \r\n weakness in big technology stocks hurt the composite as well as the nasdaq N index which fell N N or N on friday to N \r\n the nasdaq financial index lost about N N or N to N \r\n friday 's trading volume totaled N million shares \r\n the average daily share turnover for october is almost N million shares \r\n lin broadcasting surged N N to N N lin and bellsouth sweetened their merger agreement in an attempt to keep shareholders from <unk> their shares to mccaw cellular communications \r\n mccaw which dropped N N to N N has offered $ N a share for a majority of lin 's shares \r\n the revised <unk> agreement boosts the dollar amount of the special dividend lin promises to pay shareholders \r\n lin now plans to dole out $ N a share in cash up from the earlier $ N amount \r\n intel eased N to N N \r\n the semiconductor concern said the <unk> in shipment of its N computer chip will be brief and have little impact on the company 's earnings \r\n the stock fell N thursday amid concerns over problems discovered with the chip \r\n intel told analysts that the company will resume shipments of the chips within two to three weeks \r\n weisfield 's <unk> N N to N after the jewelry store operator said it is in preliminary discussions with a party it would n't identify regarding the possible acquisition of the company \r\n <unk> savings bank rose N to N after the federal deposit insurance corp. approved <unk> savings bank of new york 's $ <unk> acquisition of <unk> \r\n <unk> medical fell N to N \r\n the company said its third-quarter earnings will probably be lower than the N cents a share it reported last year despite a rise in the company 's revenue \r\n <unk> earned $ N on revenue of $ N million in the N quarter \r\n the company blamed a number of factors for the earnings decline including softer sales of <unk> \r\n london share prices closed sharply lower friday in active trading after chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson 's resignation <unk> the market and wall street 's rapid initial sell-off knocked it down \r\n london shares were depressed initially by overnight losses in new york and by the drop in sterling after mr. lawson 's resignation \r\n it showed some early resilience after central bank support firmed sterling but the weight of wall street late in london trading and signs of further weakness in the british pound proved a hefty load to bear \r\n new york stocks recovered some of their losses after the london market closed \r\n the financial times 100-share index shed N points to close at N down N N from the previous friday and N N from oct.

other dealers added that the blue-chip stocks in general were hit by profit-taking over concerns that london shares will continue posting declines and the uncertainty over sterling given that mr.

's <unk> unit are widespread \r\n unilever wo n't comment <unk> however denies the brand is for sale \r\n the presence of unilever and p&g is likely to increase the impact of advertising on cosmetics \r\n while the two are among the world 's biggest advertisers most makers of upscale cosmetics spend relatively little on national ads \r\n instead they focus on events in department stores and pour their promotional budgets into gifts that go along with purchases \r\n <unk> lauder for example spends only an estimated N N of sales on advertising in the u.s. and mr. lauder says he has no plans to change his strategy \r\n the most dramatic changes however probably will come in <unk> development \r\n nearly N N of cosmetics sales come through <unk> outlets such as drug stores and supermarkets according to andrew shore an analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc \r\n that figure has been <unk> up for several years \r\n as the trend continues demand for mass-market items that are high quality but only <unk> particularly <unk> products is expected to increase \r\n this fall for example <unk> group ordinarily a high-end line rolled out a <unk> line of <unk> products called <unk> which retail for $ N to $ N \r\n the packaged-goods marketers may try filling that gap with a spate of new products \r\n unlike the <unk> cosmetics houses unilever and p&g both have enormous research and development bases to draw on for new products \r\n p&g in fact is noted for gaining market leadership by introducing products that offer a technical edge over the competition \r\n sales of its tide detergent soared earlier this year for example after p&g introduced a version that includes a <unk> safe for all colors and <unk> \r\n that 's led industry executives to speculate that future product development will be driven more by technological innovation than by fashion <unk> especially among mass-market brands \r\n there will be more emphasis on quality says guy <unk> chief executive of <unk> inc. the u.s. <unk> of <unk> \r\n you 'll see fewer <unk> \r\n but success for unilever and p&g is far from guaranteed as shown by the many <unk> companies that have tried and failed to master the <unk> beauty business \r\n in the 1970s several pharmaceutical and packaged-goods companies including colgate-palmolive co. eli lilly & co. pfizer inc. and schering-plough acquired cosmetics companies \r\n industry consultants say only schering-plough which makes the mass-market <unk> has maintained a meaningful business \r\n colgate which acquired <unk> <unk> in N sold the brand seven years later after the brand <unk> \r\n unilever already has experienced some disappointment \r\n the mass-market <unk> brand which it acquired in N along with <unk> 's inc. has lost share according to industry analysts \r\n the <unk> world of department-store cosmetics retailing where unilever is concentrating its efforts may prove even more <unk> \r\n in this niche makeup colors change seasonally because they are linked to <unk> <unk> \r\n because brand loyalty is weak and most cosmetics purchases are <unk> careful training of store sales staffs by cosmetics companies is important \r\n and <unk> a luxury image strong enough to persuade consumers to pay more than $ N for <unk> or eye makeup requires a <unk> touch that packaged-goods companies have yet to demonstrate on their own \r\n there may be a truce in the long war of nerves between the white house and congress over how this country <unk> secret intelligence operations abroad \r\n after years of <unk> born of <unk> past <unk> of the central intelligence agency and the iran-contra scandal president bush and the senate intelligence committee appear ready for now at least to trust each other when it comes to setting policy on

to keep the committee informed usually in advance of covert actions and to put key intelligence decisions in writing \r\n that was n't always the way the reagan administration handled such matters \r\n mr. bush has pledged as well to respect the 14-year-old executive order barring u.s. agents from <unk> foreign leaders or helping others to do so \r\n congress never fully trusted former cia chief william <unk> and national security adviser john <unk> to honor the ban \r\n despite objections by the cia mr. bush also has agreed to the establishment of an inspector general at the cia who would be independent of the cia director \r\n in return the senate panel has dropped efforts to enact legislation requiring the administration to inform it within N hours of the launching of any covert activity \r\n it also has removed a ban on cia use of a <unk> fund for covert acts and has agreed to wipe away some <unk> and <unk> restrictions on coup planning put in place to ensure that the cia did n't get back in the assassination game \r\n we 've finally been able to convince them that <unk> and oliver north do n't work here anymore says one administration official \r\n the new understanding did n't just spring to life in a <unk> <unk> of <unk> and light \r\n it emerged after a <unk> display of <unk> intelligence politics that followed this month 's failed coup attempt in panama \r\n the white house used television appearances and leaks to argue that <unk> imposed restrictions on covert actions made u.s. support for such coups difficult \r\n mr. bush even disclosed privately that one <unk> deal with congress required him to notify the <unk> panamanian dictator manuel noriega if the u.s. learned of a coup plot that might endanger his life \r\n the president also hinted he might veto this year 's intelligence authorization bill if it is too restrictive \r\n intelligence committee chairman david boren d. <unk> and vice chairman william cohen r. maine for their part <unk> accused the white house of <unk> <unk> classified documents and trying unfairly to shift the blame to congress for the <unk> attempt to topple gen. noriega \r\n the white house got the better of the exchange but took care not to press its advantage to the kind of constitutional confrontation sought by conservative republicans who do n't want any congressional oversight of intelligence activities \r\n instead mr. bush and his aides made it clear they respected congress 's role and felt they could work with the conservative mr. boren and the moderate mr. cohen to iron out their differences \r\n the senators responded in kind \r\n sen. boren <unk> told reporters that there had been a meeting of the minds with the white house and that the committee had given mr. bush a clean slate free of the <unk> imposed during the reagan years \r\n sen. cohen said the relationship has <unk> to its <unk> character \r\n there still are some details to be <unk> down \r\n mr. bush is <unk> the right in rare <unk> to keep congress in the dark <unk> a constitutional <unk> the committee does n't recognize \r\n and a pending justice department interpretation of the assassination ban could raise questions that would have to be settled \r\n moreover both sides may face political critics \r\n some conservatives will accuse the president of promising congress too much \r\n and they continue <unk> attacking cia director william webster for being too <unk> to the committee \r\n at the same time some congressional liberals will accuse sens. boren and cohen of <unk> out and they will warn that the lawmakers ' concessions raise the specter of more internationally embarrassing covert operations like the mining of nicaraguan harbors and the iran arms sales \r\n but if the cooperative attitude holds and there is greater <unk> on covert activities the country could be entering an era when such <unk> schemes are scrapped before they get off the drawing boards while risky but <unk> secret operations can be undertaken without fear that a <unk> congress will <unk> \r\n several of the new york stock exchange 's own listed companies led by giant contel corp. are joining for the first time to complain about program trading and the exchange 's role in it \r\n claiming program trading has turned the big board into a gambling casino contel chairman charles wohlstetter said that he and at least N other corporate executives are forming an unprecedented alliance \r\n the group mr. wohlstetter said in an interview wants to end the market 's wild price swings that critics blame on <unk> program-trading strategies \r\n the group will complain to washington to the heads of program-trading firms and to the heads of the big board itself he said \r\n they should call the exchange trump east charged mr. wohlstetter the <unk> founder of contel who 's also a former investment banker and stock trader \r\n what is the mission of the financial community \r\n to help some <unk> or <unk> or help corporate america \r\n contel is a $ N billion telephone and electronics company \r\n pressure has been building on the big board in the past two weeks to do something about market volatility which many investors say is caused by program trading \r\n the market 's friday-the-13th plunge of N points in the dow jones industrial average and the big board 's <unk> response to it galvanized some longstanding <unk> among companies listed on the exchange \r\n last month program trading accounted for a record N N of average daily big board volume \r\n mr. wohlstetter for example said he wrote to big board chairman john j. phelan jr. about program trading after the 190-point dow plunge and as in previous <unk> what i get back is <unk> \r\n he said he 's upset that mr. phelan trying to calm investors after the plunge said that investors would simply have to get used to the market 's big price swings \r\n the big board is partly to blame for the price swings because they 're <unk> said mr. wohlstetter \r\n their powerful members manage them \r\n the focus of the outcry has been stock-index arbitrage which accounts for about half the program trading that goes on \r\n index arbitragers argue that their trading is healthy because it links markets but critics say such trading <unk> market movements and increases the chance for a crash \r\n the big board has refused to be drawn into a public debate about program trading \r\n richard <unk> big board president last week said only that the exchange is concerned about all its constituents \r\n privately exchange officials worry that without a <unk> system for program trading at the big board billions of dollars in trading will simply <unk> to overseas exchanges such as london 's \r\n it is partly for this reason that the exchange last week began trading in its own stock basket product that allows big investors to buy or sell all N stocks in the standard & poor 's index in a single trade \r\n one intended customer of the new basket product is index arbitragers according to the exchange \r\n investors have complained for some time about program trading particularly index arbitrage to little <unk> \r\n but according to some big board traders an organized campaign from <unk> companies might make the exchange finally consider big changes \r\n they wo n't fight the listed companies \r\n now the assault is on said one top trader \r\n the big board ca n't ban stock-index futures of course but it could ban use of its <unk> electronic trading system for program trading or at least encourage securities firms to back off \r\n the exchange put a bit of a <unk> on program trading when last year it simply started to publish monthly statistics of each firm 's program-trading volume \r\n contel 's mr. wohlstetter said the group of big board companies is n't ready to go public yet with its effort and that he does n't plan to be the leader once it is public \r\n however he said he planned to spend the weekend making calls to gather additional support \r\n among those mr. wohlstetter said he has been talking to are sanford <unk> of primerica corp. which is the parent of smith barney harris upham & co. gte corp. 's james johnson and itt corp. 's rand <unk> \r\n none of these chief executives were available for comment \r\n among the targets of the big board companies ' campaign will be some corporate pension funds that use program-trading strategies to maximize returns on their investments \r\n for contel 's part the company a month ago informed each of its money managers that it would drop them if they give business to program-trading firms \r\n it was just those kinds of <unk> that last week succeeded in turning up the heat in the debate \r\n kemper corp. 's kemper financial services unit said it cut off bear stearns morgan stanley oppenheimer and general electric co. 's kidder peabody & co. unit \r\n all of the firms except kidder which is the <unk> program trader on wall street quickly announced <unk> from index arbitrage \r\n kidder officials stand by their aggressive use of program trading \r\n chief executive officer michael carpenter said that despite the outcry even by some of kidder 's own brokers he believes index arbitrage does n't have a negative impact on the market as a whole \r\n however pressure on kidder 's parent ge could change kidder 's policy \r\n ge chairman john welch has been besieged with phone calls complaining about his unit 's program trading according to a person close to him \r\n margaret thatcher 's <unk> response to the latest upheaval in her government is to promise business as usual \r\n that may be the last thing she needs \r\n as the air clears from last week 's storm of resignations and <unk> the government faces a <unk> job of rebuilding confidence in its policies \r\n the prime minister and her new chancellor of the exchequer the <unk> john major need to haul the country through something like a recession to bring down inflation and set the economy moving again \r\n mrs. thatcher has to come to terms with european economic integration beginning with the european monetary system which britain is committed to joining fully someday \r\n finally the government has to convince a rattled financial community and voters it is proceeding <unk> toward its goals \r\n it sounds like the work of a decade but the deadline is late N when mrs. thatcher is expected to call another national election \r\n what 's worrying her supporters is that the economic cycle may be out of <unk> with the political timetable \r\n she could end up seeking a fourth term in an economy sick with inflation high interest rates and a heavy trade deficit \r\n though mrs. thatcher has pulled through other crises supporters wonder if her <unk> <unk> ways are the right formula today \r\n there 's a rising fear that perhaps mrs. thatcher 's style of management has become a political liability says bill martin senior economist at london brokers <unk> & drew \r\n the prime minister 's insistence on keeping a private <unk> of advisers including an economic <unk> who openly criticized former chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson confused the financial community \r\n last week the strategy of playing the two experts off each other <unk> up mr. lawson quit in <unk> and sir alan walters the adviser announced his resignation within an hour \r\n the confusion could be costly \r\n currency traders <unk> mr. major wo n't defend the pound <unk> sent the british currency sharply lower friday against the dollar and west german mark \r\n analysts expect further jitters this week \r\n a continuing slide in the pound could force the government to push through another rise in the base rate currently N N \r\n that could <unk> a weak economy into recession \r\n economists have been anticipating a slump for months but they now say it will be deeper and longer than they had thought \r\n britain 's economy is developing rapidly toward <unk> says j. paul <unk> international economist with smith barney harris upham co. in paris \r\n a mild slowdown probably would have run its course by early N economists say while the <unk> downturn now expected could stretch into N \r\n recovery could be hampered if britain 's major trading partners in europe which are enjoying robust economic activity cool off as expected in late N and N \r\n that would leave mrs. thatcher little room for maneuver \r\n for the <unk> to win the next election voters will need to sense economic improvement for about a year <unk> \r\n though mrs. thatcher does n't need to call an election until june N she would prefer doing so in late N \r\n if the economy shows no sign of turning around in about year 's time she will be very vulnerable says john <unk> a <unk> at the london school of economics \r\n there 's an equally pressing deadline for the government to define its monetary and economic ties to the rest of the european community \r\n it has sent mixed signals about its willingness to take part in the exchange-rate mechanism of the european monetary system which links the major ec currencies \r\n at a june ec summit mrs. thatcher appeared to ease her opposition to full ems membership saying britain would join once its inflation rate fell and the ec <unk> capital movements \r\n since then the government has left observers wondering if it ever meant to join \r\n sir alan <unk> the monetary arrangement as <unk> in an article being published in an american economics journal \r\n that produced little reaction from his boss reinforcing speculation the government would use its two conditions as a <unk> for avoiding full ems membership \r\n despite the departure of mr. lawson and sir alan the <unk> over the ems could continue \r\n sir <unk> <unk> deputy prime minister and a lawson ally on the ems has signaled he will continue pressing for early membership \r\n of immediate concern is whether the thatcher government will continue mr. lawson 's policy of tracking the monetary policies of the west german <unk> and responding in kind when the frankfurt authorities move interest rates \r\n mrs. thatcher does n't like taking orders from foreigners says tim <unk> economist with <unk> & national holding plc \r\n as conservatives rally around mrs. thatcher during the crisis many harbor hopes last week 's debacle will prompt change \r\n we wo n't have any more of this <unk> behavior says sir peter <unk> a <unk> <unk> member of parliament \r\n the party is fed up with <unk> of good people \r\n it 's an <unk> expectation \r\n as long as a decade ago mrs. thatcher declared she did n't want debate in her cabinet she wanted strong government \r\n over the weekend she said she did n't intend to change her style and denied she is <unk> \r\n nonsense she told an <unk> yesterday on london weekend television \r\n i am staying my own sweet reasonable <unk> \r\n joseph l. <unk> chairman and chief executive officer of mcgraw-hill inc. was elected to the board of directors of this electronics manufacturer \r\n he succeeds the retiring james w. <unk> \r\n base data \r\n computers that once were the state of the art the <unk> bought three years ago are now <unk> \r\n as we <unk> start the search for <unk> we

care and family paper work \r\n only for <unk> and home maintenance did women do less than half \r\n but the researchers found that while children 's household tasks eased the mother 's burden <unk> the husband 's helping hand appears to <unk> the children 's load almost on a <unk> basis and to reduce the wife 's responsibility only modestly \r\n this pattern was particularly evident among more highly educated couples \r\n in these families <unk> took on N N more chores than in couples with only <unk> school education \r\n but the kids with highly educated parents did N N less <unk> than those in <unk> families \r\n it is clear ms. <unk> says that most of the effect of increasing education has been to shift who is helping the <unk> \r\n her share <unk> but only slightly \r\n nursing home patients apt to be private <unk> \r\n far fewer elderly nursing home residents bankrupt themselves than was previously believed two recent studies declare \r\n state governments place very low <unk> on how much property people may own or how much income they may keep if they want welfare help on medical bills \r\n conventional wisdom has long held that anywhere from <unk> to one-half of all elderly long-term care patients are obliged to spend themselves into poverty before <unk> for medicaid assistance \r\n but separate reports from <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> institution and <unk> <unk> of the urban institute find that a surprisingly small proportion only about N N of residents start out as private <unk> but spend down to medicaid levels in a single nursing home stay before they die or are <unk> \r\n another one-third are already on medicaid when they enter the nursing homes a considerably higher proportion than the analysts anticipated \r\n but a <unk> high percentage over half are private <unk> throughout their stay even a fairly lengthy one \r\n about one-third pay out of their own pockets while the rest are covered throughout by medicare private insurers or the veterans administration \r\n both reports are based on several thousand patients <unk> in a N nationwide government survey \r\n the <unk> and urban institute authors caution however that most nursing home stays are of <unk> short <unk> and reaching the medicaid level is more likely with an unusually long stay or repeated stays \r\n moreover they note those who manage to pay their own way often do so only by selling their homes using up life savings or drawing heavily on children and other <unk> \r\n reagan era young hold liberal views \r\n the reagan generation young men and women reaching political maturity during ronald reagan 's presidency are firmly liberal on race and <unk> according to <unk> the social science research center at the university of chicago \r\n many political analysts have speculated that the reagan years would produce a <unk> conservative younger generation \r\n <unk> 's most recent opinion surveys find the youngest adults indeed somewhat more <unk> and <unk> than other adults \r\n but says chief investigator tom smith this does not translate into support for <unk> in general or into conservative positions on <unk> and civil rights issues \r\n answers to a dozen questions in the N N N and N national surveys reveal that men and women in the N to N age <unk> are considerably more liberal on race and <unk> than were the N to N year <unk> in <unk> 's <unk> in the early 1970s and early 1980s \r\n they were also as liberal or more liberal than any other age group in the N through N surveys \r\n for example N N of the N to N year <unk> in

friday oct. N was a <unk> day that turned from tension to <unk> \r\n he had been summoned to the central committee of the soviet communist party after he finished his lunch at the <unk> hotel an unlikely prelude to a bureaucratic <unk> <unk> <unk> naked <unk> float on their <unk> toward a ceiling <unk> with <unk> all surrounded by <unk> laid on with a <unk> <unk> 's <unk> and supported by marble <unk> columns whose <unk> are <unk> <unk> of gold \r\n why had mr. korotich been called \r\n i told my driver he said that he was taking my <unk> to the central committee so they can <unk> <unk> <unk> his hand made vigorous <unk> gestures on his left palm \r\n they feel the need from time to time to educate me \r\n and indeed as he later reported that was the import of the meeting \r\n anxious allies of president mikhail gorbachev are <unk> media leaders to take it easy to be careful not to do anything that could be used by mr. gorbachev 's opponents \r\n the government is nervous \r\n according to mr. korotich who was present mr. gorbachev 's publicized <unk> of the press on oct. N was more of a plea be careful boys use good judgment \r\n we 're standing in gasoline so do n't smoke \r\n u.s. and northern european diplomats confirm mr. korotich 's assessment that glasnost is in no immediate danger \r\n in fact a very <unk> soviet official told an american official at a diplomatic dinner that no change in the policy was contemplated \r\n the day after that conversation at the residence of the u.s. ambassador the <unk> editor of pravda victor <unk> was replaced by a college <unk> of mr. gorbachev 's \r\n <unk> <unk> have more to fear from mr. gorbachev than the <unk> <unk> he gave to the press \r\n at the end of the very week in which mr. korotich was called to the central committee <unk> was again <unk> its independence by printing a poll that showed that N N of the soviet population a <unk> believed that mr. gorbachev 's economic reforms perestroika would result in only <unk> change \r\n a good measurement of the popularity of <unk> <unk> like <unk> is circulation \r\n when mr. korotich took it over in N it sold N copies today it sells N million \r\n pravda meanwhile has retained only N N of its N <unk> \r\n glasnost has made <unk> of men like mr. korotich \r\n prevented by the communist party from getting on its slate of <unk> for the new supreme soviet he stood as an independent candidate for congress from his native <unk> and won with N N of the vote \r\n the same evening that he was summoned for a warning from the party he was cheered by thousands of his supporters at a rally of what can only be called the korotich party \r\n but as <unk> as the changes that have already occurred are there is a <unk> to glasnost \r\n censorship is n't a marxist <unk> \r\n the <unk> were no civil <unk> \r\n as late as the <unk> the russian government prevented any coverage of <unk> \r\n it even directed newspapers not to publish anything that might <unk> the honor of the <unk> <unk> 's wives \r\n so glasnost is not a value <unk> with steel <unk> into the fabric of russian society \r\n it is an <unk> public relations program initiated by a single political leader during a four-year <unk> of history \r\n it is public relations of the highest <unk> that recognizes that credibility is enhanced by honesty up to a point \r\n what is that point \r\n will <unk> begin a series of reports analyzing the failures of perestroika \r\n i 'd be destroying myself replies mr. korotich who then asks what would that accomplish \r\n his answer reveals his <unk> it also draws the line that soviet society must cross to enter the normal dialogue of western culture \r\n it is the line beyond which the press can report not only on the bankruptcy of factories but on the failures of even <unk> leaders \r\n mr. <unk> is editor and publisher of the <unk> ala. star \r\n a state trial judge in illinois gave preliminary approval to a proposed settlement of a suit against a bank of new york co. unit irving trust co. over the interest rates on irving 's former one wall street account money-market deposit accounts \r\n judge albert green in cook county circuit court in chicago also recognized the suit filed last may by robert and cynthia <unk> as a class action covering thousands of irving customers \r\n the plaintiffs accused irving of paying less interest than promised in a marketing <unk> \r\n irving maintained and still does that its actions were proper under its account agreements with customers \r\n under the proposed settlement customers with valid claims to be submitted by dec. N will receive valuable bank services such as credit cards with reduced finance charges for two years \r\n larry <unk> attorney for the plaintiffs valued the settlement at between $ N million and $ N million \r\n a bank of new york spokesman in manhattan owen brady said that 's the maximum outside figure \r\n federal reserve critics used to complain of stop and go monetary policies \r\n they claimed that the fed would first give a green light to the economy by making credit readily available and then turn on the red and bring growth to a <unk> halt \r\n but under alan greenspan that has changed \r\n a <unk> cautious man the fed chairman is forever <unk> yellow \r\n indeed his caution has become legendary within the government \r\n he <unk> <unk> over economic statistics <unk> them in dozens of ways probing for hours in search of potential problems \r\n after <unk> <unk> <unk> of information he often concludes that more data are needed and when he finally decides to act his movements sometimes seem <unk> small \r\n such caution was evident after the recent friday-the-13th stock market plunge \r\n some bush administration officials urged mr. greenspan to make an immediate public announcement of his plans to provide ample credit to the markets \r\n but he refused claiming that he wanted to see what happened monday morning before making any public statement \r\n mr. greenspan 's decision to keep quiet also prompted a <unk> within the fed 's ranks \r\n a senior fed official spoke on saturday after the market <unk> to both the washington post and the new york times saying the fed was prepared to provide as much credit as the markets needed \r\n the statement angered chairman greenspan but it was greeted with applause by the bush administration and the financial markets \r\n and while the <unk> fed member has n't gone public some fed governors most notably vice chairman manuel johnson are known to have disagreed with the chairman 's decision to remain silent \r\n ironically the <unk> official 's comments have earned some <unk> for mr. greenspan who is mistakenly seen as the source \r\n at a hearing last week democratic sen. chris dodd of connecticut told treasury secretary nicholas brady that chairman greenspan 's announcement over the oct. N weekend was a very important statement \r\n mr. brady <unk> replied that he was n't sure whether mr. greenspan made a statement himself or whether that was a newspaper report \r\n the fed chairman 's caution was apparent again on the monday morning after the market 's plunge when the central bank took only modest steps to aid the markets \r\n a surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking system \r\n and by the end of that week the key federal funds interest rate which is largely controlled by the fed had settled at N N barely changed from the level of just under N N that prevailed the previous week \r\n bush administration officials appear increasingly concerned that mr. greenspan is cautious to a fault \r\n signs of growing weakness in the economy <unk> with indications that inflation is staying well under control have caused them to wonder why the fed chairman is so <unk> in reducing rates \r\n those concerns are n't expressed in public \r\n in fact the administration and the fed have been going out of their way in the past two weeks to <unk> any impression that they are at odds <unk> stories about an <unk> split added to the stock market 's jitters \r\n still the split is there \r\n the administration 's concerns are <unk> \r\n the economy is showing signs of weakness particularly among manufacturers \r\n exports which played a key role in fueling growth over the last two years seem to have stalled \r\n factory <unk> and production fell in september and the auto industry and housing are in a severe crunch \r\n but mr. greenspan remains reluctant to loosen policy partly because he faces a <unk> of presidents of regional fed banks who oppose credit easing \r\n in addition the chairman has a wary eye aimed a year or two down the road \r\n inflation may be stable at the moment running at about N N \r\n but if the fed <unk> too soon mr. greenspan fears prices may begin to accelerate again next year \r\n moreover if the fed holds tight it may be able gradually to reduce inflation moving toward the <unk> goal that the fed chairman embraced in testimony to congress last week \r\n so far mr. greenspan 's cautious approach to policy has served both him and the nation well \r\n his hand on the monetary <unk> seems one reason why the economy next month seems highly likely to begin an unprecedented eighth year of <unk> growth without a recession \r\n we 've gotten through two stock market crashes and we 've gone through an election without any major problems says david <unk> an economist of kemper financial services \r\n i think you have to give greenspan a good rating \r\n but such caution is no guarantee against mistakes \r\n the fed 's reluctance to ease credit now could be laying the <unk> for a new recession perhaps starting early next year \r\n if that happens chairman greenspan could well become an open target \r\n already congress is <unk> with legislation to curb the fed 's independence \r\n if the economy turns down such proposals could gain strong momentum \r\n the following issues were recently filed with the securities and exchange commission \r\n <unk> environmental inc. initial offering of

<unk> with some of the most technical and complex disputes <unk> \r\n a new specialty court was sought by patent experts who believed that the <unk> had <unk> too many important multimillion-dollar cases \r\n some patent lawyers had hoped that such a specialty court would be filled with experts in the field \r\n but the reagan administration thought otherwise and so may the bush administration \r\n since N the president has filled four <unk> in the federal circuit court with <unk> lawyers \r\n now only three of the N judges <unk> <unk> chief judge howard t. markey N and <unk> rich N have

associate general counsel with <unk> <unk> corp. in philadelphia \r\n dr. <unk> says the justice department interviewed him last july \r\n their effort has received a <unk> response from the justice department \r\n we do not feel that seats are reserved for patent lawyers says justice spokesman david runkel who declines to say how soon a candidate will be named \r\n but we will take it into consideration \r\n the justice department 's view is shared by other lawyers and at least one member of the court judge h. robert mayer a former civil <unk> who served at the claims court trial level before he was appointed to the federal circuit two years ago \r\n i believe that any good lawyer should be able to figure out and understand patent law judge mayer says adding that it 's the responsibility of highly paid lawyers who argue before the court to make us understand complex patent litigation \r\n yet some lawyers point to eli lilly & co. vs. <unk> inc. the patent infringement

a big kidder insider-trading scandal two years ago \r\n chief executives and presidents had come and gone \r\n now the firm says it 's at a turning point \r\n by the end of this year <unk> chairman <unk> cathcart the former chairman of illinois tool works who was <unk> as a <unk> man when ge brought him in to clean up kidder in N <unk> to his lake forest ill. home possibly to build a shopping mall on some land he owns \r\n i 've done what i came to do at kidder he says \r\n and that means <unk> michael carpenter president and chief executive since january will for the first time take complete control of kidder and try to make good on some <unk> plans \r\n mr. carpenter says he will return kidder to <unk> as a great investment bank \r\n wall street is <unk> skeptical \r\n through the first nine months of the year kidder ranks a distant <unk> among underwriters of u.s. stocks and bonds with a N N market share up slightly from N N in the year-earlier period according to securities data co \r\n it 's quite a fall from the early 1980s when kidder still was counted as an investment-banking powerhouse \r\n gary s. <unk> president of the <unk> group an executive search firm said i 'd like to see kidder succeed \r\n but they have to attract good senior bankers who can bring in the business from day one \r\n in N kidder <unk> out a $ N million profit mainly because of severe cost cutting \r\n its <unk> brokerage operation reported an estimated $ N million loss last year although kidder expects it to turn a profit this year \r\n in fact kidder is a minor player in just about every business it does except computer-driven program trading in that controversial business only morgan stanley & co. rivals kidder \r\n but even that niche is under attack as several wall street firms pulled back from program trading last week under pressure from big investors \r\n mr. carpenter a former <unk> executive who has a love for task forces says he has done a complete <unk> of kidder in recent months \r\n there have been a dizzying parade of studies of the firm 's operations \r\n more than N new managing directors and senior vice presidents have been hired since january \r\n the firm 's brokerage force has been trimmed and its <unk> staff increased to a record N people \r\n mr. carpenter says that when he assumes full control kidder will finally tap the resources of ge \r\n one of ge 's goals when it bought N N of kidder in N was to take advantage of <unk> between kidder and general electric capital corp. ge 's <unk> unit which has $ N billion in assets \r\n the leveraged buy-out group of ge capital now reports to mr. carpenter \r\n so far instead of <unk> up ge capital staffers and kidder investment bankers have <unk> \r\n yet says mr. carpenter we 've really started to exploit the <unk> between ge capital and kidder peabody \r\n the units have worked on N investment banking deals this year he says though not all of them have <unk> out \r\n we 've had a good relationship with ge which is the first time you could say that <unk> let me withdraw that \r\n it 's been a steadily improving relationship says mr. carpenter \r\n still without many actual deals to show off kidder is left to stress that it finally has a team in place and that everyone works harder \r\n a month ago the firm started serving dinner at about N each night about N to N of the N people in the investment banking operation have consistently been around that late \r\n we are working significantly longer and harder than has been the case in the past says scott c. <unk> kidder 's head of investment banking since june \r\n everywhere kidder <unk> the always working theme \r\n a new in-house magazine kidder world which will focus on the firm 's <unk> strategy says mr. carpenter <unk> that on <unk> mr. <unk> often gets <unk> ideas while flying his <unk> <unk> <unk> on the way to <unk> \r\n the firm 's new head of mergers and acquisitions under mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> talks of the opportunity to rebuild a franchise at kidder \r\n the kidder name is one of only six or seven that every ceo recognizes as a viable alternative when considering a merger deal he says \r\n now according to a kidder world story about mr. <unk> all the firm has to do is position ourselves more in the deal flow \r\n with investment banking as kidder 's lead business where do kidder 's <unk> brokerage network and its N brokers fit in \r\n mr. carpenter this month sold off kidder 's eight brokerage offices in florida and puerto rico to merrill lynch & co. <unk> speculation that kidder is getting out of the brokerage business entirely \r\n mr. carpenter denies the speculation \r\n to answer the brokerage question kidder in typical fashion completed a <unk> study \r\n the result kidder will focus on rich individual investors and small companies much closer to the <unk> of goldman sachs & co. than a <unk> firm like merrill lynch or shearson lehman hutton inc \r\n mr. carpenter notes that these types of investors also are sophisticated enough not to complain about kidder 's aggressive use of program trading \r\n as part of the upscale push kidder is putting brokers through a <unk> training course turning them into investment <unk> with knowledge of corporate finance \r\n they will get new and improved tools to sell particularly to the affluent investor says brokerage chief charles v. <unk> \r\n <unk> the brokers will then be able to <unk> leads on corporate finance opportunities to kidder 's investment bankers possibly easing the longstanding tension between the two camps \r\n however skeptics caution that this kind of <unk> between brokers and investment bankers looks great on paper but does n't always happen \r\n kidder competitors are n't <unk> hostile to the firm as many are to a tough competitor like drexel burnham lambert inc. that does n't have kidder 's long history \r\n however competitors say that kidder 's hiring binge involving <unk> staffers some with <unk> contract guarantees could <unk> unless there are results \r\n the <unk> mr. cathcart says he has no worries about kidder 's future \r\n mr. cathcart who will return to the <unk> <unk> co. board of directors in addition to his personal ventures is credited with bringing some basic <unk> and planning discipline to traditionally <unk> kidder \r\n he also improved the firm 's compliance procedures for trading \r\n mr. cathcart says he has had a lot of fun at kidder adding the crack about his being a <unk> man never bothered him \r\n it was an absolutely <unk> line and one i used many times he says \r\n smiling broadly when he talks about mr. carpenter mr. cathcart says the new kidder chief is going to be recognized shortly as one of the real leaders in the investment-banking business \r\n in coming years mr. cathcart says kidder is <unk> <unk> <unk> \r\n or as mr. carpenter again drawing on his <unk> background puts it we 're ready to implement at this point \r\n under a proposal by democrats to expand individual retirement accounts a $ N contribution by a taxpayer in the N N <unk> would save $ N on his taxes \r\n the savings was given incorrectly in friday 's edition \r\n in what could prove a major addition to the philippines ' <unk> portfolio a taiwanese company signed a $ N million construction contract to build the centerpiece of a planned petrochemical complex \r\n taiwan 's <unk> far east corp. a petrochemical company <unk> the agreement with an unidentified japanese contractor to build a <unk> <unk> according to <unk> lee who heads the philippine company set up to build and operate the complex \r\n mr. lee president of luzon petrochemical corp. said the contract was signed wednesday in tokyo with <unk> far east officials \r\n contract details however have n't been made public \r\n the complex is to be located in <unk> about N miles south of manila \r\n <unk> far east will hold a N N stake in luzon petrochemical according to papers signed with the philippine government 's board of investments \r\n the proposed petrochemical plant would use <unk> to manufacture the petrochemicals <unk> and <unk> and their <unk> <unk> <unk> and polyethylene \r\n these are the raw materials used in making plastics \r\n the contract signing represented a major step in the <unk> petrochemical project \r\n at an estimated $ N million the project would represent the single largest foreign investment in the philippines since president <unk> aquino took office in february N \r\n it also is considered critical to the country 's efforts to both attract other investment from taiwan and raise heavy industry <unk> \r\n the project has been in and out of the pipeline for more than a decade \r\n however workers ca n't break ground until legal <unk> to block the complex are resolved moves which caused the signing to remain questionable up to the last moment \r\n as previously reported a member of the philippines ' house of representatives has sued to stop the plant \r\n the legislator <unk> garcia had actively backed the plant but at the original site in his constituency northwest of manila \r\n the country 's supreme court dismissed the suit but mr. garcia late last month filed for a <unk> \r\n in addition president aquino has yet to sign into law a bill removing a stiff N N tax on <unk> the principal raw material to be used in the <unk> \r\n however at a news conference thursday mrs. aquino backed the project and said her government was attempting to <unk> the feelings of residents at the original site adjacent to the government 's major petroleum refinery in <unk> province \r\n we have tried our best to tell the people in <unk> that maybe this time it will not go to them but certainly we will do our best to encourage other investors to go to their province mrs. aquino told <unk> foreign <unk> \r\n the project appeared to be on the rocks earlier this month when the other major partner in the project china general plastics corp. backed out \r\n china general plastics another taiwanese petrochemical manufacturer was to have a N N stake in luzon petrochemical \r\n however mr. lee said that <unk> far east is confident other investors will take up the slack \r\n he said <unk> far east has applied to both the asian development bank and the world bank 's international finance corp. for

thursday 's edition it was incorrectly indicated that the union had paid a fee to former house speaker jim wright \r\n president bush insists it would be a great tool for curbing the budget deficit and <unk> the <unk> out of government programs \r\n he wants it now \r\n not so fast says rep. <unk> edwards of oklahoma a fellow republican \r\n i consider it one of the <unk> ideas of the 20th century he says \r\n it 's the line-item veto a procedure that would allow the president to kill individual items in a big spending bill passed by congress without <unk> the entire bill \r\n whatever one thinks of the idea it 's far more than the budgetary <unk> it may seem at first <unk> \r\n rather it 's a device that could send shock waves through the president 's entire relationship with democrats and republicans alike in congress fundamentally enhance the power of the presidency and transform the way the government does its business \r\n president bush badly wants a line-item veto and has long called for a law giving it to the president \r\n now the white house is declaring that he might not rely on congress which has n't shown any willingness to surrender such authority to pass the line-item veto law he seeks \r\n white house spokesmen last week said mr. bush is considering simply declaring that the constitution gives him the power exercising a line-item veto and inviting a court challenge to decide whether he has the right \r\n although that may sound like an <unk> maneuver of little interest outside washington it would set off a political earthquake \r\n the <unk> are enormous says rep. don edwards a california democrat who is a senior member of the house judiciary committee \r\n it 's a real face-to-face arm <unk> challenge to congress \r\n white house aides know it 's a step that ca n't be taken <unk> and for that reason the president may back down from launching a test case this year \r\n some senior advisers argue that with further fights over a capital-gains tax cut and a <unk> bill looming mr. bush already has enough pending <unk> with congress \r\n they prefer to put off the line-item veto until at least next year \r\n still mr. bush and some other aides are strongly drawn to the idea of trying out a line-item veto \r\n the issue arose last week when vice president dan quayle told an audience in chicago that mr. bush was looking for a test case \r\n white house press secretary marlin fitzwater confirmed that mr. bush was interested in the idea but cautioned that there was n't a firm decision to try it \r\n mr. bush former president reagan and a host of conservative activists have been arguing that a line-item veto would go a long way in restoring discipline to the budget process \r\n they maintain that a president needs the ability to <unk> remove pork-barrel spending projects that are attached to big omnibus spending bills \r\n those bills ca n't easily be vetoed in their <unk> because they often are needed to keep the government operating \r\n conservatives note that N governors have the line-item veto to use on state budgets \r\n more <unk> some conservative legal <unk> have begun arguing that mr. bush does n't need to wait for a law giving him the veto because the power already is implicit in the constitution \r\n they base their argument on a clause buried in article i section N of the constitution that states every order resolution or vote to which the <unk> of the senate and house of representatives may be necessary except on a question of <unk> shall be presented to the president of the united states and before the same shall take effect shall be approved by him or <unk> by him \r\n this clause they argue is designed to go beyond an earlier clause <unk> that the president can veto a bill and is broad enough to allow him to strike out items and riders within bills \r\n senate minority leader robert dole r. kan. for one <unk> this argument and earlier this year publicly urged mr. bush to use the line-item veto and allow the courts to decide whether or not it is constitutional \r\n there 's little doubt that such a move would be immediately challenged in court and that it would quickly make its way to the supreme court to be ultimately resolved \r\n it 's a major issue and they would n't want to leave it at a lower level says stephen <unk> a new york attorney whose <unk> have been instrumental in pushing the idea that a president already has a line-item veto \r\n rep. edwards the california democrat is one who <unk> that he would immediately challenge mr. bush in the courts arguing a line-item veto would expand a president 's powers far beyond anything the <unk> of the constitution had in mind \r\n it puts this president in the legislative business he declares \r\n that 's not what our <unk> had in mind \r\n in addition to giving a president powers to rewrite spending bills meant to be written in congress rep. edwards argues a line-item veto would allow the chief executive to <unk> lawmakers \r\n he notes that as a <unk> from the san francisco area he fights each year to preserve federal funds for the bay area rapid transit system \r\n if a president had a line-item veto and wanted to force him to support a controversial <unk> initiative rep. edwards says the president could call and declare that he would <unk> kill the bart funds unless the congressman <unk> up on the <unk> issue \r\n proponents maintain that a president would choose to use a line-item veto more <unk> than that \r\n but there may be another problem with the device despite all the political <unk> it would cause it might n't be effective in cutting the deficit \r\n big chunks of the government budget like the <unk> programs of social security and medicare would n't be affected \r\n governors have found that they have to use the device <unk> to maintain political <unk> \r\n and it is n't even clear that some pork-barrel projects can be hit with a line-item veto because they tend to be listed in informal conference reports accompanying spending bills rather than in the official bills themselves \r\n still proponents contend that the veto would have what mr. <unk> calls an important <unk> effect on all manner of appropriations bills \r\n lawmakers they say would avoid putting many spending projects into legislation in the first place for fear of the embarrassment of having them singled out for a line-item veto later \r\n whatever the outcome of a test case president bush would have to move cautiously <unk> the very attempt would <unk> not just democrats but republicans says louis fisher a scholar at the congressional research service who specializes in <unk> relations \r\n republicans have as much interest as democrats in the way the system works he notes \r\n indeed although a majority of republican lawmakers favor a line-item veto some ranging from liberal oregon sen. mark <unk> to conservative rep. edwards are opposed \r\n rep. edwards voices the traditional conservative view that it 's a mistake to put too much power in the hands of a single person \r\n conservatives pushing for a line-item veto now he notes may regret it later sometime you 're going to have a democratic president again who 'll use his expanded powers against those very same conservatives \r\n every order resolution or vote to which the <unk> of the senate and house of representatives may be necessary except on a question of <unk> shall be presented to the president of the united states and before the same shall take effect shall be approved by him or being <unk> by him shall be <unk> by two-thirds of the senate and house of representatives according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill \r\n this has n't been kellogg

mills has gained an estimated N N share so far this year mostly at the expense of kellogg \r\n each share point is worth about $ N million in sales \r\n analysts say much of kellogg 's erosion has been in such core brands as corn <unk> rice <unk> and <unk> <unk> which represent nearly one-third of its sales volume \r\n kellogg is so anxious to turn around corn <unk> sales that it soon will begin selling boxes for as little as N cents trade sources say \r\n <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> have <unk> away sales normally going to kellogg 's <unk> lines simply because they are made of <unk>

might be scaled back in any future construction \r\n initial cost estimates for the plant which was to have been built in <unk> ranged from $ N billion to $ N billion \r\n a company spokesman said it was possible but highly unlikely that the plant might never be built \r\n as we regain our leadership level where we have been and as we continue to put new products into the marketplace and need additional capacity we will look at <unk> our involvement with our plan he said \r\n the new facility was to have been the world 's most advanced cereal manufacturing plant and kellogg 's largest

indian capital market \r\n one is whether there is enough money to fund the new issues without <unk> stock trading \r\n moreover in the relatively <unk> indian stock markets investors frequently do n't know what they are getting when they subscribe to an issue \r\n a prospectus in india does n't always tell a potential investor much \r\n some of the large amounts are being raised by small firms \r\n in addition once money is raised investors usually have no way of knowing how it is spent \r\n some analysts are concerned that the mega-issues in such an <unk> environment could lead to a <unk> \r\n the rate of failures will be much more than the rate of successes in the <unk> says <unk> patel a former chairman of the giant <unk> mutual fund the unit trust of india \r\n they 're going to have <unk> \r\n the indian stock markets have been on a five-year high with <unk> and <unk> since prime minister <unk> gandhi started <unk> industry \r\n but the last stock market boom in N seems small compared with the current rush to market \r\n the $ N billion that some N companies are looking to raise in the year ending march N compares with only $ N billion raised on the capital market in the previous fiscal year \r\n in fiscal N before mr. gandhi came to power only $ N million was raised \r\n this year 's biggest issue $ N million of convertible debentures by engineering company larsen & toubro ltd. is the largest in indian history \r\n and it is n't the only giant issue together the top four issues will raise $ N billion \r\n convertible debentures bonds that can later be converted into equity shares are the most popular instrument this year though many companies are also selling <unk> bonds or equity shares \r\n these mega-issues are being propelled by two factors economic and political \r\n in the past the socialist policies of the government strictly limited the size of new steel mills petrochemical plants car factories and other industrial concerns to <unk> resources and restrict the profits businessmen could make \r\n as a result industry operated out of small expensive highly inefficient industrial units \r\n when mr. gandhi came to power he <unk> in new rules for business \r\n he said industry should build plants on the same scale as those outside india and benefit from economies of scale \r\n if the output was too great for the domestic market he said companies should export \r\n india 's <unk> businessmen had to be persuaded but they have started to think big \r\n some of the projects being funded by the new issues are the first <unk> of mr. gandhi 's policy and they require more capital than the smaller industrial units built in the past \r\n the industrial revolution has produced an explosion in the capital market which is a far cheaper source of funds than <unk> banks where interest rates for prime borrowers are around N N \r\n the second factor spurring mega-issues is political \r\n mr. gandhi has called general elections for november and many businessmen fear that he and his congress i party will lose \r\n some companies are raising money in anticipation of a government less predictable than mr. gandhi 's and possibly more restrictive \r\n the <unk> <unk> rumor mill also says that some of the money raised in the current spate of issues will be used as campaign donations before the elections \r\n no one admits to anything but india 's <unk> have a history of making <unk> campaign donations \r\n so far the mega-issues are a hit with investors \r\n earlier this year <unk> iron & steel co. 's offer of $ N million of convertible debentures was oversubscribed \r\n <unk> <unk> ltd. a marine construction company had similar success with a slightly smaller issue \r\n larsen & toubro started accepting applications for its giant issue earlier this month bankers and analysts expect it to be oversubscribed \r\n still to come are big issues by <unk> <unk> <unk> ltd. a petrochemical and <unk> company and <unk> <unk> corp india a semiconductor maker \r\n while many investors are selling parts of their portfolios to buy the new issues prices on india 's N stock exchanges are holding up so far \r\n i do n't think it will lead to any chaos in the secondary market says mr. patel only a sagging tendency \r\n says <unk> <unk> chairman of the unit trust of india the markets are headed for growth <unk> of and <unk> before \r\n but with growth come growing <unk> and never has this been <unk> on the indian capital market than now \r\n in the past the government controlled the markets indirectly through its tight grip on industry itself \r\n various ministries decided the products businessmen could produce and how much and government-owned banks controlled the financing of projects and monitored whether companies came through on promised plans \r\n the government has been content with this far-reaching <unk> form of control exercised on a <unk> basis with no clear rules or guidelines \r\n but now with large amounts being raised from investors the government 's <unk> on regulation and disclosure requirements has a more dangerous aspect \r\n the securities and exchange board of india was set up earlier this year along the lines of the u.s. securities and exchange commission but new <unk> has n't pushed the legislation to make it operational \r\n mr. dave its head acts <unk> and patient but he makes no <unk> about the need to get to work \r\n <unk> or <unk> we feel the prospectus standards need to be considerably improved he says \r\n disclosures are very poor in india \r\n he says the big questions do you really need this much money to put up these investments have you told investors what is happening in your sector what about your track record are n't asked of companies coming to market \r\n instead he says most investors have to rely on the <unk> indian press \r\n an example is the biggest offering of them all larsen & toubro 's $ N million bond issue \r\n the engineering company was acquired in a takeover earlier this year by the giant reliance textile group \r\n although larsen & toubro had n't raised money from the public in N years its new owners frequently raise funds on the local market \r\n reliance <unk> a $ N million petrochemical company in N that was at the time the largest public issue in indian history \r\n the media has raised questions about larsen & toubro 's issue pointing out that it exceeds the company 's annual sales and its market capitalization \r\n even <unk> is the case of <unk> <unk> a semiconductor company with N sales of $ N million that 's raising $ N million to build an iron plant \r\n once the money is raised it is n't always certain how it is used \r\n larsen & toubro for example says it 's raising $ N million to use as supplier credit on large engineering jobs \r\n unlike other companies it has n't <unk> specific projects for the funds \r\n and even when specific projects are described in <unk> the money often is used elsewhere according to analysts \r\n someone must monitor where the funds are deployed says mr. dave \r\n mr. patel agrees there is no proper monitoring and <unk> of the use of these funds \r\n they 're trying to plug the various <unk> but they 're totally <unk> for this \r\n because of the large amounts of money being raised the loose disclosure requirements and the casual monitoring of how the money is used some analysts fear that there could be a few <unk> which could hurt market confidence far more than the small <unk> that followed the boom of N \r\n the government insists that such a possibility is low \r\n it says that despite loose regulation of the market itself its longstanding regulation of industry will prevent such crashes \r\n <unk> <unk>

the japanese market is setting its sights on overseas expansion \r\n last year dentsu started <unk> a joint network with u.s. ad agency young & rubicam and eurocom of france \r\n a few months ago dentsu acquired N N of australian agency fortune communication holdings ltd. for N million australian dollars us$ N million \r\n dentsu has u.s. subsidiaries but they keep low <unk> \r\n now the giant marketing company which holds N N of japan 's N trillion yen $ N billion advertising industry is considering the acquisition of an advertising network in the u.s. or europe \r\n what is driving dentsu 's international expansion largely is the need to keep up with its japanese clients as they grow in the u.s. and europe \r\n if we do n't do something we wo n't be able to catch up with demand says a dentsu spokesman \r\n our president said acquisition is an effective method \r\n last year dentsu 's foreign business accounted for less than N N of total billings but the company is aiming at N N in the near future \r\n so far it appears cautious about taking the big step \r\n for example the spokesman says dentsu has been approached by banks and securities companies a number of times to invest in the troubled british marketing group saatchi & saatchi plc \r\n but he said dentsu has n't looked seriously at saatchi \r\n though dentsu says it has no concrete acquisition plans or deadlines it is laying the <unk> for international growth \r\n it is setting up a special team in charge of international markets and training workers to do business abroad \r\n for the year ended march N dentsu sales rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion and net income jumped N N to $ N million from $ N million \r\n dentsu 's billings last year were larger than those of young & rubicam the world 's second-largest ad agency according to a survey by the publication advertising age \r\n but success overseas in <unk> markets could be <unk> than for other industries such as manufacturers \r\n on its own dentsu 's muscle in japan may count for little in major foreign markets when seeking <unk> clients \r\n thus an acquisition may prove the necessary course \r\n but japanese agencies are cautious about expanding abroad because client relationships are different \r\n japanese agencies do business with rival clients in the same industry a practice that would be <unk> by traditional western conflict rules says roy <unk> the london chief executive of saatchi & saatchi 's communications division \r\n although acquiring a foreign company would expand japanese advertising agencies ' business to foreign clients many clients would also be japanese companies expanding overseas says the dentsu spokesman \r\n but the different business system would make it hard for dentsu to provide these japanese companies the same kind of services they do in japan \r\n ciba-geigy ag the big swiss chemicals company said that it agreed in a letter of intent with corning inc. to acquire corning 's N N

mr. ortega 's threat over the weekend to end a <unk> cease-fire with the rebels seeking to topple him effectively <unk> the contras as a policy priority just as they were slipping from the <unk> of their most <unk> supporters \r\n senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine said yesterday on <unk> 's meet the press that mr. ortega 's threat was a very <unk> move particularly the timing of it \r\n the threat came during a two-day celebration in costa rica to highlight central america 's progress toward democracy in the region attended by president bush canadian prime minister brian <unk> and N other western <unk> leaders \r\n mr. bush returned to washington saturday night \r\n mr. ortega announced on friday that he would end the cease-fire this week in response to the periodic contra

remaining u.s. humanitarian aid be diverted to <unk> and <unk> the rebels \r\n not only did mr. ortega 's comments come in the midst of what was intended as a <unk> for the region it came as nicaragua is under special international scrutiny in anticipation of its planned february elections \r\n outside observers are gathering in nicaragua to monitor the registration and treatment of opposition candidates \r\n and important u.s. lawmakers must decide at the end of november if the contras are to receive the rest of the $ N million in so-called humanitarian assistance under a bipartisan

honduras replaced the military aid cut off by congress in february N \r\n while few lawmakers anticipated that the humanitarian aid would be cut off next month mr. ortega 's threat practically

support to the contras through the february elections although he added that the agreement requires that the contras not <unk> any military action \r\n mr. ortega 's threat to breach the cease-fire comes as u.s. officials were acknowledging that the contras have at times violated it themselves \r\n secretary of state james baker who accompanied president bush to costa rica told reporters friday i have no reason to deny reports that some contras <unk> some sandinista soldiers \r\n mr. baker 's assistant for <unk> affairs bernard <unk> while maintaining that the sandinistas had also broken the

addition to <unk> arguments in favor of ending contra aid mr. ortega 's remarks also played to the <unk> of some u.s. officials and conservatives outside the government that he is searching for ways to manipulate or <unk> the february elections \r\n administration officials traveling with president bush in costa rica interpreted mr. ortega 's <unk> as a sign that he is n't responding to the military attacks so much as he is searching for ways to strengthen his hand prior to the elections \r\n mr. abrams said that mr. ortega is seeking to <unk> the contras prior to the elections to remove any pressure to hold fair elections \r\n my sense is what they have in mind is an excuse for <unk> down on <unk> by creating an atmosphere of a military emergency he said \r\n milton petrie chairman

cftc has N days to respond to such applications \r\n the merc first started working on developing this contract in N \r\n only three weeks earlier the merc had turned to one of its own executives 40-year-old r. patrick thompson to replace <unk> t. <unk> as president \r\n mr. thompson is believed to have a mandate from the board of directors to help improve the merc 's <unk> reputation as an exchange whose floor traders do n't follow the rules very well \r\n ms. <unk> had been forced out in july in a bitter power struggle with <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman and a longtime floor trader on the exchange \r\n mr. <unk> told one person familiar with the new york exchanges during the search for a replacement that he was looking for a president who would be responsive to the needs of the membership and the board \r\n mr. thompson first came to the exchange in N and has been executive vice president since march N \r\n he previously held posts of senior vice president of compliance and senior vice president and general counsel \r\n by contrast the comex in july imported a highly regarded outsider arnold f. <unk> as its president \r\n mr. <unk> N was a senior officer of the philadelphia stock exchange and is considered a specialist in new financial products \r\n mr. thompson is n't <unk> of experience with new products however \r\n for the past two years he said he and the exchange 's research department have been working on the new natural gas contract seeking a good delivery site and studying the natural gas market \r\n our members are eager to begin trading this contract so we expect no difficulty in attracting <unk> to the natural gas pit he said \r\n the educational effort of teaching companies in the natural gas industry how to use the futures to hedge would have to continue for another a year or two he added \r\n the merc 's extremely successful contracts in crude oil gasoline and heating oil have made it the largest futures exchange in new york and third behind the chicago board of trade and chicago mercantile exchange \r\n in a recent interview mr. thompson said the biggest problem facing all commodity exchanges was one of image \r\n earlier this year the u.s. attorney indicted N floor traders and one clerk at the two big chicago exchanges \r\n federal authorities in new york started investigating exchanges in may though no <unk> have been handed down there \r\n so far they have issued scores of <unk> some of which went to members of the new york merc \r\n mr. thompson will have to face some of the consequences of those <unk> \r\n in a recent general accounting office study the merc was found to have been the most <unk> in <unk> exchange rules \r\n it <unk> the smallest number of <unk> of traders and fines of the four largest commodity exchanges studied over the past five years \r\n it also had both the <unk> and least experienced investigators per million contracts traded \r\n the merc received considerable criticism in N when it was discovered that its compliance director kevin p. conway who then was responsible for <unk> the exchange 's busy oil and metal pits was engaged in other personal business activities on exchange time including <unk> trips according to a new york merc report prepared last year \r\n mr. conway is no longer at the exchange \r\n we had a management breakdown in N in terms of compliance mr. thompson says \r\n we recognized the problem and took care of it \r\n he says that even if the natural gas contract boosts volume at the exchange strongly the N business plan calls for having adequate compliance people to ensure that exchange rules are being followed \r\n for years the five new york exchanges have been talking about <unk> in various aspects of their business in order to improve the efficiency of their operations \r\n <unk> there has even been talk of mergers between one or more exchanges \r\n so far there is little to show for such efforts \r\n mr. thompson believes the case for working together is stronger now than ever \r\n the cost of competition has become extremely high he says \r\n we must find ways to save money for the futures commission merchants who do business on our exchanges \r\n he thinks that progress in cooperation can be made in areas where no vested interests have built up \r\n one of those areas is the development of a hand-held electronic device that would permit floor traders to enter trades as they make them \r\n the <unk> has recommended the creation of a system to record trade data so that an independent <unk> audit trail can be established to prevent customer fraud \r\n the merc is now <unk> with the comex in developing such a device to provide such an audit trail \r\n the chicago exchanges also are working on such a device \r\n another major electronics problem faces mr. thompson the creation of a 24-hour trading system that can be used outside normal trading hours \r\n in january the new york merc signed a letter of intent with the chicago merc as a preliminary step to joining their electronic system called <unk> \r\n but in may the chicago merc said it was looking into creating a common system with the chicago board of trade and it suspended negotiations with the new york merc \r\n mr. thompson says his exchange is n't waiting for the results of the chicago exchanges ' cooperation \r\n it recently began a pilot program to test an electronic trading system called <unk> the automated trading system created by the international commodities clearing house \r\n looking ahead to commodity markets this week \r\n copper \r\n michael <unk> metals trader for painewebber inc. in new york said there is good technical support between $ N and $ N a pound for december copper which

too much difficulty he said \r\n but he said it wo n't climb further and he expects it to remain in a trading range between $ N and $ N \r\n he noted that the equity markets will set the tone for the industrial metals this week and traders should keep an eye on wall street \r\n william <unk> research director for elders futures inc. in new york said for a rally to occur there must be demand from the far east \r\n he added that talk of strike settlements at producing mines has been fully discounted \r\n however to resume the bull trend according to mr. <unk> copper would have to close over $ N \r\n he said there are two reports this week that might affect prices the purchasing managers report on wednesday and the unemployment report on friday \r\n precious metals \r\n friday 's strong price gains confirmed a turnaround in the precious metals markets according to painewebber 's mr. <unk> \r\n most traders will be looking to buy on <unk> he said \r\n he thought the moves in the metals last week were most influenced by the uncertainty in the equity and other financial markets \r\n according to mr. <unk> floor traders say there is good support for december gold in the $ N to $ N per ounce

prices during the harvest \r\n traders will also watch for whether the soviet union continues its traditional fall buying of u.s. grain \r\n so far this month the soviets have bought about N million

weeks \r\n last week traders said there were three institutional sellers for every buyer \r\n every day we 're getting new bid lists from would-be sellers one trader said \r\n most dealers can not continue to absorb this supply \r\n as a result yields on long-term <unk> bonds now stand at about N N of long-term treasury yields the highest such level in more than two years \r\n there is incredible negative psychology building in the market said <unk> <unk> a vice president at merrill lynch & co \r\n people are very concerned about who is going to step up to the plate and buy municipal bonds in the absence of institutional buyers \r\n the yield on a group of N revenue bonds compiled by the bond buyer a trade publication now exceeds N N \r\n at this week 's new york city

analysts say the institutional selling was triggered by several factors \r\n big banks such as chemical bank and chase manhattan which have been taking heavy charges to expand their third world loan-loss reserves are n't looking for tax-exempt income \r\n we do n't need the shelter of tax-free bonds said a spokeswoman at chemical \r\n in recent weeks traders said chemical has sold more than

worried about the impact of a slowing economy on tax revenue at a time when many state and local governments already face budget deficits and huge spending needs \r\n the recent natural disasters and the need of many other cities to rebuild crumbling infrastructure suggests that supply of new issues will continue to rise sharply even as demand <unk> off \r\n there is just so much going on that it 's difficult to pick just one factor that 's driving the market said ronald ian heller vice president at first chicago capital markets inc. a subsidiary of first chicago corp \r\n some of the recent selling could actually be considered a positive sign \r\n mutual funds for example are said to be selling existing municipal bonds to raise cash to buy new issues \r\n because municipal bonds yields have risen at a time when interest rates generally have fallen some portfolio managers are assuming that bonds bought now will appreciate in value as the municipal bond market <unk> \r\n ms. <unk>

some issues fell nearly one point or close to $ N for each $ N face amount \r\n the sell-off in new york city bonds was triggered by concerns about the city 's financial health and political uncertainty in view of the impending mayoral election \r\n the city 's economy is growing weaker and expenditures are rising as tax revenue is falling \r\n the city has issued so much supply recently that some people are getting a little concerned \r\n they 'd like to see some other names in their portfolios said michael s. <unk> first vice president at shearson lehman hutton \r\n but he thinks investors may be <unk> to the market 's problems \r\n overall he says municipal prices are very cheap and represent an excellent buying opportunity \r\n friday 's market activity \r\n treasury bonds

billion quickly and would do so by issuing new securities this week \r\n credit market analysts expected the treasury to cancel today 's three-month and six-month sale and to sell $ N billion of cash management bills \r\n instead the treasury announced it would sell $ N billion of <unk> cash management bills today and said that the weekly sale of $ N billion of three-month and six-month bills will

N and again on oct. N as <unk> <unk> of good judgment that have only temporarily undermined a healthy stock market \r\n sure price action is volatile and that 's scary but <unk> stocks are still a good place to be they suggest \r\n the reaction to the ual debacle is <unk> says john connolly chief market strategist at dean witter \r\n ual is a small deal as far as the overall market is concerned \r\n the only way you can make it a big deal is to draw <unk> that just do n't make sense \r\n he suggests for example that investors may have assumed that just because ual could n't get financing no leveraged buy-outs can get financing \r\n carried even further some investors assumed that since leveraged buy-outs are the only thing <unk> up stock prices the market would collapse if no more lbos could be done \r\n there will still be deals argues mr. connolly \r\n there may not be as many and the buyers may not get away with some of the things they 've done in the past but deals wo n't disappear \r\n he forecasts that the emphasis in mergers and acquisitions may soon return to what he calls strategic deals in which somebody is taking over a company not to milk the cash flow but because it 's a good fit \r\n and even without deals mr. connolly figures the market would remain healthy \r\n he notes for instance that there has n't been a merger or acquisition among the N stocks in the dow jones industrial average since N yet that average only three weeks ago hit a record high \r\n those stocks are up because their earnings are up and their dividends are up he says \r\n even the volatility created by stock index arbitrage and other computer-driven trading strategies is n't entirely bad in mr. connolly 's view \r\n for the long-term investor who picks stocks carefully the price volatility can provide welcome buying opportunities as short-term players scramble <unk> to sell stocks in a matter of minutes \r\n who can make the better decision the guy who has N seconds to decide what to do or the guy with all the time in the world he says \r\n what on earth does the ual deal have to do with the price of <unk> which i was able to buy on oct.

little too <unk> says mr. <unk> \r\n it provided an excuse for people to get back to reality and to look at the economic data especially the third-quarter economic numbers and to realize that we ca n't continue to <unk> over what is going on in the junk bond market \r\n but he figures that at current levels the stock market is <unk> valued even with the economy obviously slowing \r\n just because we 've got some <unk> back in the market does n't mean it 's going lower from here he says \r\n the bottom line is that it 's healthy to have this kind of <unk> activity especially after a N N gain in stock values over the past N months \r\n he 's now estimating that after a period of consolidation the dow jones industrial average will once again forge new highs \r\n maybe maybe not \r\n <unk> joseph cohen a market strategist at drexel burnham lambert is n't nearly so <unk> about the market 's chances of surging to new highs anytime soon \r\n her view is that stock prices have three major <unk> merger and buy-out proposals earnings and the economic outlook \r\n at current levels of economic activity and earnings stocks are fairly valued she says \r\n but any chance for prices to surge above fair value lies in the speculation that <unk> a vigorous merger and buy-out business and ual has obviously put a <unk> on that \r\n stocks are n't cheap anymore there have been some judicial and legislative changes in the merger area and all of this changes the <unk> of deals she says \r\n i 'm not saying they 've stopped altogether but future deals are going to be structured differently and bids probably wo n't be as high \r\n but that 's not the only problem for stocks \r\n the other two <unk> earnings and the economic outlook are troubling too \r\n <unk> is getting all

the outlook for earnings in the fourth quarter and all of N is getting worse \r\n there are a lot more downward than upward revisions and it looks like people are questioning corporate profits as a

iowa a structural flaw that developed during the making of a titanium engine disk \r\n for several months officials at the federal aviation administration and the national transportation safety board have suspected that a <unk> flaw in the disk led to a crack that ultimately caused the <unk> engine to break apart in flight \r\n the explosion sent <unk> of metal flying <unk> the <unk> 's <unk> or

of ual corp. should have been able to detect the cracks through maintenance checks \r\n the engine involved was a <unk> made by general electric co \r\n anthony broderick the faa 's acting executive director for regulatory standards and compliance said that recent tests of the failed engine disk indicate that a flaw known as hard <unk> occurred in the titanium during its production almost N years ago \r\n he said there was n't any way to detect the flaw at that time and that the process has since been changed to decrease the chance that such flaws would occur \r\n the faa already has ordered that all N disks made by the old process be removed from the planes and <unk> to an <unk> test in a <unk> chamber \r\n such tests make the faa confident that a <unk> <unk> accident wo n't happen again said mr. broderick \r\n a spokesman for ge said that the company has been working with the faa all along on this issue and will comply fully with the required <unk> \r\n but he also pointed out that

he said \r\n a frozen <unk> in <unk> may offer an important clue about whether the earth is warming <unk> \r\n researchers at ohio state university and <unk> institute of <unk> and <unk> in china have

important piece of evidence supporting theories that the earth has <unk> considerably in recent times largely because of <unk> in the air and will warm far more in the century ahead \r\n a substantial warming would <unk> some of the earth 's <unk> ice <unk> raising the level of the <unk> and causing widespread flooding of heavily <unk> coastal areas \r\n if you can use data to <unk> what happened in the past you have much more confidence in predictions for the future said <unk> thompson a research scientist at ohio state who <unk> for and <unk> the ice samples \r\n to compare temperatures over the past N years researchers <unk> the changes in <unk> of two forms of <unk> \r\n these measurements can indicate <unk> changes researchers said because the rates of <unk> of these <unk> atoms differ as temperatures change \r\n analysis of ice from the <unk> ice cap a <unk> <unk> in <unk> N feet above sea level show that average temperatures were higher in N than in any other <unk> period since before the last ice age mr. thompson said \r\n some climate models project that interior regions of asia would be among the first to heat up in a global warming because they are far from <unk> which moderate <unk> changes \r\n but the <unk> samples are n't definitive proof that the so-called greenhouse effect will lead to further substantial global heating mr. thompson acknowledged \r\n according to greenhouse theories increased carbon dioxide emissions largely caused by burning of fossil fuels will cause the earth to warm up because carbon dioxide prevents heat from <unk> into space \r\n skeptics say that if that 's the case temperatures should have risen fairly <unk> over the past century reflecting the increase in carbon dioxide \r\n instead the <unk> <unk> record shows increasing temperatures from N through the early 1950s <unk> temperatures from the late 1950s through the mid-1970s then higher temperatures again through last year \r\n other <unk> data show similar <unk> swings \r\n climate <unk> drastically due to natural causes said mr. thompson \r\n but he said ice samples from peru <unk> and <unk> all show substantial signs of warming \r\n <unk> corp. said its

construction bill that cuts spending for new installations by N N while revamping the pentagon budget to move more than $ N million from foreign bases to <unk> projects \r\n the fiscal N measure builds on a pattern set earlier this year by house and senate defense <unk> committees and at a time of <unk> for the military and concern about the u.s. 's standing in the world economy overseas spending is most vulnerable \r\n total pentagon requests for installations in west germany japan south korea the united kingdom and the philippines for example are cut by almost two-thirds while lawmakers added to the military budget for construction in all but a dozen states at home \r\n the result is that instead of the pentagon 's proposed split of N between domestic and foreign bases the reduced funding is distributed by a ratio of approximately N \r\n the extra margin for bases in the u.s. <unk> the power of the appropriations committees meanwhile lawmakers used their positions to <unk> as much as six times what the pentagon had requested for their individual states \r\n house appropriations committee chairman jamie whitten d. miss helped secure $ N million for his state or more than double the pentagon 's budget \r\n west virginia home of senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd would receive $ N million four times the military 's request \r\n tennessee and north carolina home states of the two democratic chairmen of the house and senate military construction <unk> receive $ N million or N N above the pentagon 's request \r\n though spending for iowa and oregon was far less their increases above pentagon requests N N and N N respectively were much greater because of the influence of republicans at critical <unk> \r\n the swift passage of the bill which cleared the senate and house on simple voice votes last week contrasts with the problems still facing a more <unk> $ N billion measure funding housing environmental space and veterans programs \r\n by an N margin the senate approved the bulk of the spending friday but the bill was then sent back to the house to resolve the question of how to address budget limits on credit <unk> for the federal housing administration \r\n the house democratic leadership could seek to waive these restrictions but the underlying bill is already under attack for excesses elsewhere \r\n appropriations committees have used an <unk> of devices to <unk> as much as $ N billion in spending and as critics have <unk> to these devices the bill can seem like a <unk> <unk> trying to make it past ice and <unk> to reach safer winter <unk> \r\n much of the excess spending will be pushed into fiscal N and in some cases is temporarily <unk> in <unk> accounts in anticipation of being transferred to <unk> areas after the budget <unk> is completed \r\n for example a house-senate conference <unk> increased the national aeronautics and space administration budget for construction of facilities to nearly $ N million or more than $ N million above what either chamber had previously approved \r\n part of the increase would provide $ N million toward ensuring construction of a costly solid <unk> facility in mr. whitten 's mississippi \r\n but as much as $ N million or nearly N N of the account is marked for potential transfers to research management and flight accounts that are spent out at a faster <unk> \r\n the bill 's managers face criticism too for the unusual number of conditions openly imposed on where funds will be spent \r\n conservatives embarrassed by republican <unk> scandals at the department of housing and urban development have used the issue in an effort to shift blame onto a <unk> congress \r\n hud secretary jack kemp backed an unsuccessful effort to strike such language last week but received little support from the white house budget office which wants to protect <unk> funding in the bill and has <unk> to turn its eyes from pork-barrel amendments \r\n within discretionary funds for community development grants more than $ N million is allocated to six projects in michigan home state of a subcommittee chairman rep. bob <unk> \r\n house speaker thomas foley won $ N for a project in his district in washington state and $ N million earmarked by sen. daniel inouye amounts to a business subsidy under the title <unk> sugar mills job <unk> \r\n the powerful democrat had first wanted to add language <unk> environmental restrictions on two mills on the <unk> coast that are threatening to close \r\n when this plan met resistance it was agreed instead to take money from hud to subsidize needed improvements in two settling <unk> for the mills which employ an estimated N workers according to mr. inouye 's office \r\n dennis <unk> 's oct.

for that big factory to open river traffic to increase government spending to fund <unk> programs or public schools to educate <unk> students \r\n because we refuse to face the tough answers the

exploration and production group which finds and develops oil and gas reserves in the u.s. by as much as N N as part of a new restructuring of that sector of its business \r\n management advised employees friday that it was going to reduce employment in production operations of the group by N N or N people \r\n the exploration side of the unit has recently <unk> a similar overhaul during which it also lost as many as N employees a company spokesman said in response to questions \r\n mobil exploration & producing u.s. inc. the group involved currently has a work force of somewhat less than N \r\n a few years ago mobil restructured the entire company during an industrywide <unk> \r\n but since then u.s. oil production has declined and mobil wants to focus its <unk> efforts overseas \r\n mobil <unk> to the <unk> cuts last week when it took a $ N million charge as part of its third-quarter earnings and attributed it to a restructuring \r\n mobil officials said that it is unlikely any additional charges related to this move will be taken in future quarters \r\n on wednesday mobil will begin offering separation packages and voluntary retirement in its u.s. production operation \r\n mobil officials said they have been studying ways of streamlining these operations since early this year \r\n during the coming months <unk> of management will be <unk> away and regional offices will become more <unk> \r\n for greater efficiency employees at those locations will be <unk> into teams responsible for managing the properties under their jurisdiction mobil said \r\n the main

unit \r\n field offices at new orleans houston denver midland <unk> <unk> calif. oklahoma city and liberal kan. will be maintained \r\n but the staffs at some of those locations will be slashed while at others the work force will be increased \r\n for instance employment in denver will be reduced to N from N \r\n but on the west coast where profitable oil production is more likely than in the <unk> region the <unk> calif. office staff of N will grow by N to N \r\n the reorganization will focus on the value and potential of assets mr. <unk> said \r\n wanted an investment that 's as simple and secure as a certificate of deposit but offers a return worth getting excited about \r\n with $ N billion of cds maturing this month a lot of people have been <unk> the financial landscape for just such an investment \r\n in april when many of them bought their cds six-month certificates were yielding more than N N investors willing to look could find double-digit yields at some banks and thrifts \r\n now the nationwide average yield on a six-month cd is just under N N and N N is about the best around \r\n but investors looking for alternatives are n't finding it easy \r\n yields on most fixed-income securities are lower than several months ago \r\n and the stock market 's recent gyrations are a painful reminder of the dangers there \r\n if you 're looking for a significantly higher yield with the same level of risk as a cd you 're not going to find it says washington financial planner dennis m. <unk> \r\n there are however some alternatives that <unk> investors should consider investment advisers say \r\n short-term municipal bonds bond funds and <unk> annuities are some of the choices they mention and not just as a way to get a higher return \r\n in particular advisers say investors may want to look at securities that reduce the risk that cd holders are <unk> right now of having to reinvest the proceeds of maturing short-term certificates at lower rates \r\n a mix of cds and other holdings may make the most sense \r\n people should remember their money is n't all or nothing they do n't need to be shopping for the one <unk> investment and putting all their money in it says <unk> md. adviser karen schaeffer \r\n here 's a look at some of the alternatives \r\n short-term municipals \r\n investors with a heavy tax load should take out their <unk> \r\n yields on municipal bonds can be higher than after-tax yields on cds for maturities of perhaps one to five years \r\n that 's because <unk> interest is exempt from federal income tax and from state and local taxes too for <unk> investors \r\n for an investor paying tax at a N N rate a seemingly <unk> N N yield on a one-year <unk> is equivalent to a taxable N N \r\n rates approach N N on five-year municipals \r\n some of the more cautious cd holders might like <unk> municipals \r\n these securities get top credit ratings because the issuers have put aside u.s. bonds that will be sold to pay off holders when the municipals are retired \r\n it 's a <unk> you do n't have to worry about diversification you do n't have to worry about quality says steven j. <unk> executive vice president of the new york bond firm of <unk> <unk> & <unk> inc \r\n consider a <unk> bond portfolio with issues maturing in say N N and N advises malcolm a. <unk> a <unk> r.i. financial planner \r\n the idea is to have money rolling over each year at prevailing interest rates \r\n bond funds \r\n bond mutual funds offer diversification and are easy to buy and sell \r\n that makes them a reasonable option for investors who will accept some risk of price <unk> in order to make a bet that interest rates will decline over the next year or so \r\n buyers can look forward to double-digit annual returns if they are right \r\n but they will have disappointing returns or even losses if interest rates rise instead \r\n bond resale prices and thus fund share prices move in the opposite direction from rates \r\n the price movements get bigger as the maturity of the securities <unk> \r\n consider for instance two bond funds from vanguard group of investment cos. that were both yielding N N on a recent day \r\n the short term bond fund with an average maturity of N N years would deliver a total return for one year of about N N if rates drop one percentage point and a one-year return of about N N if rates rise by the same amount \r\n but in the same circumstances the returns would be a more extreme N N and N N for the vanguard bond market fund with its N 1\\/2-year average maturity \r\n you get <unk> returns from bonds if you guess right on rates says james e. wilson a columbia s.c. planner \r\n if interest rates do n't change bond fund investors ' returns will be about equal to the funds ' current yields \r\n deferred annuities \r\n these insurance company contracts feature some of the same tax benefits and restrictions as <unk> individual retirement accounts investment gains are compounded without tax consequences until money is withdrawn but a N N penalty tax is imposed on withdrawals made before age N N \r\n aimed specifically at cd holders are so-called <unk> annuities or certificates of annuity \r\n an interest rate is guaranteed for between one and seven years after which holders get N days to choose another guarantee period or to switch to another insurer 's contract without the surrender charges that are common to annuities \r\n some current rates exceed those on cds \r\n for instance a <unk> annuity from north american co. for life & health insurance chicago offers N N interest for one year or a N N rate for two years \r\n annuities are rarely a good idea at age N because of the withdrawal restrictions \r\n but at age N they may

deaths have occurred here \r\n the united kingdom reports came from dr. patrick toseland head of clinical chemistry at guy 's hospital in london \r\n in a telephone interview friday dr. toseland said the number of sudden <unk> deaths of diabetics he had seen this year was N compared with just two in N \r\n at least six of the deaths occurred among relatively young diabetics who had switched from animal to human insulin within the past year he said \r\n dr. <unk> <unk> director of <unk> and <unk> drug products for the u.s. food and drug administration said fda officials have discussed dr. toseland 's findings fairly <unk> \r\n while there have been no reports of similar sudden <unk> deaths among diabetics in the u.s. dr. <unk> said the fda plans to examine dr. toseland 's evidence and is considering its own study here \r\n dr. toseland a <unk> said he was preparing an article for a british <unk> medical journal raising the possibility that the deaths may have occurred after human insulin <unk> critical warning signs indicating hypoglycemia or low blood sugar which can kill diabetics \r\n the usual warning signs of hypoglycemia include <unk> anxiety and <unk> \r\n with proper warning diabetics can easily raise their blood sugar to safe levels by eating sugar or <unk> food \r\n the <unk> data certainly shows that some of the people were not aware of the rapid <unk> of hypoglycemia dr. toseland said \r\n at the u.s. national institutes of health dr. robert e. <unk> chief of the <unk> program branch said no evidence of unexpected deaths from hypoglycemia had shown up in a study of N diabetics that has been under way at nih for five years \r\n however he said officials conducting the study had n't been looking for signs of problems related to hypoglycemia <unk> \r\n we are now monitoring for it much more closely he said \r\n we do know there are slight differences in the way human and animal <unk> drive down blood sugar dr. <unk> said \r\n the <unk> drug starts the blood sugar dropping sooner and drives it down faster he said \r\n but we do n't believe there is enough of a difference to be <unk> significant dr. <unk> said \r\n reports of dr. toseland 's findings in the british press have triggered widespread concern among diabetics there \r\n both the british <unk> association and the committee on safety in <unk> britain 's equivalent of the u.s. fda recently issued statements noting the lack of hard scientific evidence to support dr. toseland 's findings \r\n on friday the american <unk> association issued a similar statement urging the six million u.s. diabetics not to <unk> to the british report \r\n a loss of the warning symptoms of hypoglycemia is a complex problem that is very unlikely to be due simply to the type of insulin used the american association said \r\n the fda already requires drug manufacturers to include warnings with insulin products that symptoms of hypoglycemia are less <unk> with human insulin than with <unk> products \r\n eli lilly & co. the <unk> drug manufacturer dominates the u.s. human insulin market with its product known as <unk> \r\n lilly is building plants to make the insulin in indianapolis and

from animal to human insulin but did n't know if the problem had caused any deaths \r\n dr. <unk> thompson a lilly group vice president said the company 's clinical trials of both its animal and <unk> <unk> indicated no difference in the level of hypoglycemia between users of either product \r\n dr. toseland said most of the british diabetics who died had been taking a <unk> insulin made by <unk> a

N \r\n defense intellectuals have complained for years that the pentagon can not determine priorities because it has no strategy \r\n last april the new defense secretary richard cheney acknowledged that given an ideal world we 'd have a nice neat orderly process \r\n we 'd do the strategy and then we 'd come around and do the budget \r\n this city does n't work that way \r\n with a five-year defense plan costing more than $ N trillion it 's about time we put together a defense strategy that works in washington \r\n this wo n't happen until strategists come down from their ivory tower and learn to work in the real world of limited budgets and uncertain futures \r\n as it is we identify national goals and the threats to these goals we shape a strategy to counter these threats we determine the forces needed to execute the strategy before finally <unk> the budgets needed to build and maintain the forces \r\n these procedures consume millions of <unk> of labor and produce tons of paper and each year their end product the five year defense plan promptly <unk> away \r\n the <unk> on the left shows how this happens see accompanying illustration wsj oct. N N \r\n compare the past eight five-year plans with actual appropriations \r\n the pentagon 's strategists produce budgets that simply can not be executed because they assume a defense strategy depends only on goals and threats \r\n strategy however is about possibilities not hopes and dreams \r\n by ignoring costs u.s. strategists <unk> their responsibility for hard decisions \r\n that puts the real strategic decisions in the hands of others <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> \r\n these people have different <unk> \r\n and as a result as the recent vote by the house to undo mr. cheney 's program <unk> suggests the <unk> of jobs is becoming the real goal of defense strategy \r\n how can we turn this situation around \r\n reform starts in the pentagon \r\n strategists should consider the impact of budget uncertainties at the beginning of the planning process \r\n they ought to examine how a range of optimistic to pessimistic budget scenarios would change the defense program \r\n they would then develop priorities by identifying the least painful program cuts as they moved from higher to lower budgets \r\n they would also identify the best way to add programs should the budget come in at higher levels \r\n this kind of <unk> analysis is common in war planning and business planning \r\n there is no reason that it can not be done for defense planning \r\n two steps are necessary to translate this idea into action \r\n step N <unk> up our books \r\n our five-year plan contains three accounting devices negative money an above <unk> management reserve and optimistic inflation estimates which <unk> the spending the pentagon has committed itself to by almost $ N billion \r\n negative money was invented in N to make the N five year defense plan conform to the numbers in president reagan 's final budget <unk> to congress \r\n that plan exceeded the numbers contained in his budget message by $ N billion \r\n to make the books balance as is required by law somebody invented a new budget line item that simply <unk> $ N billion \r\n it is known in the pentagon as the negative wedge \r\n the pentagon argues that the negative wedge is the net effect of $ N billion in the <unk> unidentified procurement reductions that it intends to find in future years and $ N billion in an above <unk> management reserve that accounts for <unk> programs that will <unk> in the future \r\n the N plan also assumes inflation will decline to N N by N \r\n most <unk> including those in the congressional budget office assume inflation will be in excess of N N in each of those five years \r\n at that rate the defense plan is <unk> by $ N billion \r\n by adding the negative wedge and <unk> the remaining program using a more probable inflation estimate we arrive at a baseline program costing $ N trillion between N and N \r\n step N <unk> how four <unk> lower budget scenarios would change the baseline and how these changes would affect our national security \r\n the <unk> on the right which assumes a N N rate of inflation places these scenarios in the context of recent appropriations see accompanying illustration wsj oct. N N \r\n note how the baseline program assumes a sharp increase in future appropriations \r\n step N will answer the question what happens if these increases do not <unk> \r\n scenario N known as the constant dollar freeze <unk> the pentagon for inflation only it <unk> upward at N N per year \r\n this scenario has been the rough position of the u.s. senate since N and it reduces the baseline by $ N billion between N and N \r\n scenario N the current dollar freeze has been the <unk> position of the house of representatives for about four years \r\n it <unk> the budget at its current level and forces the pentagon to eat the effects of inflation until N \r\n this reduces the baseline by $ N billion \r\n scenario N <unk> the recent <unk> between the house and the senate it <unk> the difference between scenarios N and N by increasing the budget at N N per year \r\n it reduces the baseline by $ N billion \r\n finally scenario N reduces the budget by N N per year for the next five years a total reduction of $ N billion \r\n this can be thought of as a pessimistic prediction perhaps driven by the <unk> effects of the gramm-rudman deficit reduction law or possibly a <unk> of <unk> with the soviet union \r\n the strategic planners in the joint chiefs of staff would construct the most effective defense program for each scenario <unk> strengths and <unk> weaknesses \r\n they would conclude their efforts by producing a comprehensive net assessment for each plan including the assumptions made an analysis of its deficiencies and limitations the impact on national security and the best strategy for working around these limitations \r\n this exercise would reveal the true cost of a particular program by forcing the strategists to make hard decisions \r\n if for example they choose to keep the b-2 <unk> bomber they would have to sacrifice more and more other programs such as carrier <unk> or army divisions as they moved toward lower budget levels \r\n these <unk> would <unk> priorities by <unk> when the cost of the b-2 became <unk> \r\n some may be <unk> to argue that the idea of a strategic review merely <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> concept of the carter administration \r\n but <unk> did not involve the strategic planners in the joint chiefs of staff and therefore <unk> into a <unk> drill driven by budget politics \r\n anyway <unk> 's procedures were so <unk> that everyone involved was crushed under a burden of <unk> \r\n a strategic review is fundamentally different \r\n it would be run by the joint chiefs under simple <unk> produce the best possible force for each budget scenario and provide the secretary of defense with a comprehensive net assessment of how that force could be used to achieve u.s. goals \r\n it might be feared that even thinking about lower budgets will hurt national security because the door will be opened to <unk> budget cutting by an irresponsible congress \r\n this argument plays well in the atmosphere of <unk> and <unk> <unk> the pentagon and congress and unfortunately there is some truth to it \r\n but in the end it must be rejected for logical as well as moral reasons \r\n to say that the pentagon should act <unk> because acting <unk> will <unk> congress into acting <unk> leads to the conclusion that the pentagon should deliberately <unk> its needs in the national interest in other words that it is justified in committing a crime lying to congress because it is morally superior \r\n strategy is not a game between the pentagon and congress it is the art of the possible in a world where constraints force us to choose between <unk> or <unk> alternatives \r\n if we want meaningful priorities we must understand the <unk> they <unk> before we make commitments \r\n strategy is not a separate event in an <unk> <unk> of <unk> events it is a way of thinking that <unk> threats to our interests in a manner consistent with our financial cultural and physical limitations \r\n mr. <unk> is a permanent pentagon official \r\n this is a <unk> version of an <unk> that will appear in the january issue of the naval institute proceedings \r\n the views expressed do not reflect the official policy of the department of defense \r\n although bullish dollar sentiment has <unk> many currency analysts say a massive sell-off probably wo n't occur in the near future \r\n while wall street 's tough times and lower u.s. interest rates continue to undermine the dollar weakness in the pound and the yen is expected to offset those factors \r\n by default the dollar probably will be able to hold up pretty well in coming days says <unk> <unk> a foreign-exchange adviser at credit suisse \r\n we 're close to the bottom of the near-term ranges she contends \r\n in late friday afternoon new york trading the dollar was at N marks and N yen off from late thursday 's N marks and N yen \r\n the pound strengthened to $ N from $ N \r\n in tokyo monday the u.s. currency opened for trading at N yen down from friday 's tokyo close of N yen \r\n the dollar began friday on a firm note gaining against all major currencies in tokyo dealings and early european trading despite reports that the bank of japan was seen unloading dollars around N yen \r\n the rise came as traders continued to dump the pound after the sudden resignation thursday of british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson \r\n but once the pound <unk> with help from purchases by the bank of england and the federal reserve bank of new york the dollar was dragged down traders say by the stock-market slump that left the dow jones industrial average with a loss of N points \r\n with the stock market <unk> and dollar buyers discouraged by signs of u.s. economic weakness and the recent decline in u.s. interest rates that has diminished the <unk> of dollar-denominated investments traders say the dollar is still in a <unk> position \r\n they 'll be looking at levels to sell the dollar says james <unk> a foreign-exchange marketing representative at bank of montreal \r\n while some analysts say the dollar eventually could test support at N marks and N yen mr. <unk> and others do n't see the currency <unk> sliding under support at N marks and N yen soon \r\n predictions for limited dollar losses are based largely on the pound 's weak state after mr. lawson 's resignation and the yen 's inability to strengthen substantially when there are dollar <unk> \r\n with the pound and the yen lagging behind other major currencies you do n't have a confirmation that a sharp dollar downturn is in the works says mike <unk> senior currency analyst at <unk> inc. in chicago \r\n as far as the pound goes some traders say a slide toward support at $ N may be a favorable development for the dollar this week \r\n while the pound has attempted to stabilize currency analysts say it is in critical condition \r\n sterling plunged about four cents thursday and hit the week 's low of $ N when mr. lawson resigned from his <unk> post because of a policy <unk> with other cabinet members \r\n he was succeeded by john major who friday expressed a desire for a firm pound and supported the relatively high british interest rates that he said are working exactly as intended in reducing inflation \r\n but the market remains uneasy about mr. major 's policy strategy and the prospects for the pound currency analysts contend \r\n although the bank of england 's tight monetary policy has fueled worries that britain 's slowing economy is headed for a recession it is widely believed that mr. lawson 's willingness to <unk> up the pound with interest-rate increases helped stem pound selling in recent weeks \r\n if there are any signs that mr. major will be less inclined to use interest-rate boosts to rescue the pound from another plunge that currency is expected to fall sharply \r\n it 's fair to say there are more risks for the pound under major than there were under lawson says malcolm roberts a director of international bond market research at salomon brothers in london \r\n there 's very little upside to sterling mr. roberts says but he adds that near-term losses may be small because the selling wave that followed mr. major 's appointment apparently has run its course \r\n but some other analysts have a <unk> forecast for the pound particularly because britain 's inflation is <unk> at a relatively <unk> annual rate of about N N and the nation is <unk> with a struggling government and large current account and trade deficits \r\n the pound likely will fall in coming days and may trade as low as N marks within the next year says nigel <unk> an international economist at james capel & co. in london \r\n the pound was at N marks late friday off sharply from N in new york trading a week earlier \r\n if the pound falls closer to N marks the bank of england may raise britain 's base lending rate by one percentage point to N N says mr. <unk> \r\n but such an increase he says could be viewed by the market as too little too late \r\n the bank of england indicated its desire to leave its monetary policy unchanged friday by declining to raise the official N N <unk> rate that it charges discount houses analysts say \r\n pound concerns aside the lack of strong buying interest in the yen is another <unk> for the dollar many traders say \r\n the dollar has a natural base of support around N yen because the japanese currency has n't been purchased heavily in recent weeks says ms. <unk> of credit suisse \r\n the yen 's softness she says apparently stems from japanese investors ' interest in buying dollars against the yen to purchase u.s. bond issues and persistent worries about this year 's upheaval in the japanese government \r\n on new york 's commodity exchange

N i was able to stand <unk> before my <unk> finance students and <unk> that the findings of your <unk> experiment on stock picking is completely consistent with what they have been taught in the

an investor who invested $ N a year ago in the first four stocks selected by your pros and then sold those one month later purchasing the four new pro picks and repeated this process for the year would have accumulated $ N excluding account dividends taxes and commissions \r\n in contrast an investor holding the dow jones portfolio over the year would have accumulated only $ N \r\n accepted theories of asset pricing offer a perfectly legitimate explanation \r\n accepted theories state that investors require higher returns on riskier investments \r\n thus rather than seeing the excess returns to the <unk> portfolio as being <unk> i see those returns as simply <unk> for taking on added risk \r\n i believe the risk for each individual stock selected by your pros is very large \r\n if you asked me to select a stock with the highest expected return i would select a stock with the greatest amount of <unk> risk as i am sure your pros do \r\n your hypothetical investor is simply being <unk> for taking on this added risk \r\n moreover your hypothetical investor has <unk> the gains to be had in reducing risk by diversifying his portfolio \r\n a <unk> portfolio is still exposed to a great deal of unnecessary risk \r\n this means the returns can vary a great deal \r\n mr. dorfman provides confirming evidence of this phenomenon when he reports that your staff of <unk> <unk> would

\r\n the fact that stock pickers have <unk> a <unk> selected portfolio in eight of N months has no bearing on the <unk> theory \r\n what matters is that the stocks recommended by your pros tend to be substantially riskier than a diversified portfolio \r\n for example your pickers ' recommendations for the coming month are on average N N riskier than holding the market portfolio according to value

\r\n they ought to be able to do this \r\n but airlines say it would be too expensive and cause too many delays if they started using computerized <unk> to check tickets at the gate \r\n texans get reasonable car rental insurance \r\n consumer advocates have long claimed that car rental companies charge too much for car rental insurance \r\n now a new law in texas seems to be providing the proof \r\n the law the first of its kind requires car rental companies in texas to charge only reasonable rates for <unk> waiver insurance \r\n specifically the law says the rates must closely reflect what the company 's actual expenses have been to replace damaged cars \r\n before the law went into effect last month car rental companies were charging as much as $ N a day for the waiver in texas \r\n now they 're charging as little $ N a day \r\n if they 're telling the truth now then they 've been charging N N more than what is reasonable says steve <unk> an assistant state attorney general in texas \r\n a spokesman for hertz corp. acknowledges the waiver is n't a source of protection for consumers but a source of revenue \r\n but hertz points out that at least it 's now charging only $ N a

airlines sometimes make flight attendants work N hours or more straight despite union contracts at some airlines limiting duty time to N hours \r\n some flight attendants on charter planes are putting in <unk> work days the study found \r\n this happens because the faa does n't have any rules on duty time for flight attendants by contrast it strictly restricts duty time for pilots and air traffic

if there 's an evacuation \r\n in response to the study the faa says it is considering changing its policy or lack of it on flight attendants \r\n the agency may not have much choice a congressional

capital-gains plan is a temporary reduction when it is not \r\n i think the reason is that you are confusing tax rates with tax payments \r\n your sept. N page-one story on the house-passed capital-gains plan is a good example \r\n you lead readers to believe that the house reduced the capital-gains tax for two years only \r\n you virtually ignore the <unk> power of indexation which in many cases is more substantial than a lower rate \r\n the monetary tax benefit of indexation for all gains in excess of inflation can be measured using the following equation tax rate times inflation rate times basis for the gain \r\n depending on the size of the gain and the rate of inflation indexation can mean a lower tax payment than using the N N rate without indexation \r\n but in any event and this is the important point tax payments on capital gains will be lower with indexation than under current law even though the tax rate is the same under both systems \r\n as you can see the capital-gains reduction plan adopted by the house would not be temporary but permanent \r\n i hope that you begin talking about the plan 's permanent and in my view most beneficial feature indexation \r\n rep. robert k. <unk> r. calif washington \r\n that the <unk> for the two-year reduction to N N is budgetary does not mean it is not in the public interest \r\n the reduction <unk> the burden on portfolio changes and <unk> capital to seek more productive or more appropriate uses \r\n but what is really significant is the indexation of capital gains after N \r\n to argue that this is not likely to affect the economy in positive ways is contrary both to recent experience with capital-gains tax cuts and to common sense \r\n a large part of the long-term appreciation of assets reflects inflation and the taxation of <unk> capital gains is <unk> \r\n does the journal really believe that people ignore the prospect of having a substantial part of their capital confiscated when they decide whether to save or how to invest \r\n under current law it is not financially rational to <unk> consumption \r\n real <unk> returns from financial assets are on

financial instruments \r\n but the chief <unk> body for accountants backed off one part of its original proposal made earlier this year that would have required a breakdown of certain <unk> items related to <unk> sheet instruments \r\n the <unk> detail was opposed by many banks and thrifts that felt the cost of supplying such data was n't worth the value of the disclosures \r\n under the initial proposal for example banks would have been required to disclose that portion of <unk> for loan losses that reflects specific letters of credit for which customers had defaulted \r\n the final rule wo n't require such a breakdown of the <unk> for loan losses which appears on the balance sheet \r\n the fasb rule will cover such financial instruments as interest rate swaps financial guarantees <unk> interest rate contracts loan contracts loan commitments and options written on <unk> held \r\n it will require companies to <unk> out in more detail collateral <unk> and <unk> of

accounting loss that would occur if the outside party involved in the instrument failed to perform and the company 's policy for requiring collateral or other security for the instrument \r\n scott

the researchers reported in this week 's issue of the journal science \r\n the current vaccine for whooping cough or pertussis is part of the <unk> for <unk> pertussis <unk> shot given most <unk> and young children \r\n the vaccine is effective in preventing a disease that still <unk> about N million children a year world-wide causing an estimated one million deaths \r\n the vaccine however causes <unk> reactions that can be fatal \r\n the reactions stem from the fact that the vaccine contains multiple copies of the whole <unk> pertussis bacterium which causes whooping cough \r\n this bacterium produces a toxin that if used as a vaccine can induce <unk> to whooping cough \r\n unfortunately the toxin is also <unk> \r\n the <unk> scientific team said they had succeeded in getting bacteria to produce a <unk> version of the pertussis toxin which could be used as a safe vaccine \r\n the researchers reported they have been able to <unk> the five genes that produced the toxin out of the pertussis bacterium \r\n it turned out that although it took all five genes to produce the toxin only one was responsible for the toxin 's <unk> \r\n ordinarily in genetic engineering each of these genes minus the one that caused the <unk> would have been transferred to another bacterium called e. <unk> which would then produce a <unk> version of the toxin \r\n the researchers said they did this but the toxin did n't induce <unk> to whooping cough \r\n the scientists then took the five toxin genes and triggered a <unk> in the one gene that caused <unk> \r\n then using a new technique called <unk> <unk> for introducing genes into cells they transferred all five genes to bacteria closely related to the pertussis <unk> \r\n these <unk> <unk> ordinarily do n't make the toxin \r\n but the genes were accompanied by a piece of dna called a <unk> that turns the genes on \r\n the new bacteria recipients of the genes began producing pertussis toxin which because of the <unk> <unk> gene was

management \r\n at the time we had only daughters explains the <unk> <unk> so we had to close the bank \r\n much of the family 's <unk> remained \r\n although its <unk> residence was destroyed by

indeed the competition is n't greatly concerned \r\n it would be surprising if they did n't come to frankfurt in time for N and they bring an interesting tradition \r\n but the market really is n't going to be stood on its head said a banker at one of frankfurt 's big three banks \r\n the return of the rothschilds is modest \r\n the new representative office with one manager and two <unk> none a

average rallied almost all of the way back \r\n paul <unk> who manages more than $ N billion of investments at <unk> capital management inc. blames futures markets for leading the way \r\n the fundamentals do n't change in an hour he says \r\n i think they should close down the futures exchange and then we could get back to investing \r\n index arbitrage the <unk> buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in futures is frequently blamed for adding to stock market volatility \r\n although index arbitrage is said to add liquidity to markets john <unk> managing partner of edward d. jones says too much liquidity is n't a good thing \r\n the kind of instant liquidity that is implied by index futures is that you can buy a portfolio over two years and get out in one day \r\n it 's too <unk> he says \r\n it is n't investing \r\n but stock-index futures have plenty of support \r\n defenders say futures make markets more efficient and provide ways for investors to reduce risks \r\n they note that stocks experienced volatile swings long before futures \r\n and defenders say few people complain about futures when stock prices are rising \r\n louis <unk> managing director in charge of equity options and futures at salomon inc. says that trading baskets of stocks began in the 1970s a decade before the advent of futures \r\n futures he says merely cut down on trading costs \r\n he says blaming futures is like blaming the <unk> \r\n since stock-index arbitrage merely narrows the gap between prices in the futures and stock markets it ca n't add to volatility he says \r\n futures do n't need defending says andrew <unk> a spokesman for the chicago mercantile exchange which trades the s&p N by far the largest stock-index futures contract \r\n despite the current outcry over stock market volatility few people expect stock futures to disappear \r\n for one thing the chicago futures exchanges have political and financial clout including many friends in congress \r\n and traders say that futures have become an accepted part of the financial landscape \r\n all life is about change either you <unk> or die says one chicago futures trader \r\n if futures are n't permitted here we 'll take it to australia or tokyo \r\n average daily volume in s&p N futures last year was N contracts \r\n based on yesterday 's closing price of the s&p the average value of one day 's trading amounts to $ N billion \r\n by contrast average dollar volume on the big board last year was $ N billion \r\n many investment managers say futures are useful as a way to hedge portfolios \r\n if managers fear that the overall stock market will fall but want to continue owning stocks they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts \r\n average daily volume in s&p N futures last year was N contracts \r\n based on yesterday 's closing price of the s&p the average value of one day 's trading amounts to $ N billion \r\n by contrast average dollar volume on the big board last year was $ N billion \r\n many investment managers say futures are useful as a way to hedge portfolios \r\n if managers fear that the overall stock market will fall but want to continue owning stocks they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts \r\n and although criticism of futures generally comes from wall street one chicago futures trader notes that brokerage firms rely on futures as hedging tools when they buy and sell big blocks of stocks from institutions \r\n one reason futures are said to add volatility is that unlike in stocks people can speculate in futures with little money down \r\n margin requirements for speculators on the chicago mercantile exchange are currently about N N \r\n for $ N million you can move $ N million of stocks a specialist on the big board <unk> \r\n that gives futures traders a lot more power \r\n by contrast an investor in stocks must put up N N in cash \r\n some critics say futures encourage people to think of stocks as a single commodity rather than as investments in individual businesses \r\n thus they say futures inhibit the basic purpose of the stock market to accurately price securities so that capital and investment flows where it 's needed most \r\n the s&p N index futures transferred the identity of N stocks into one unit making them a simple commodity to trade says george <unk> senior vice president at a. webster <unk> in philadelphia \r\n it took away the need to know the bad third-quarter report of ibm for example mr. <unk> says \r\n of course portfolio trading the increasingly common practice of buying or selling baskets of actual stocks also <unk> stocks as <unk> commodities \r\n there is a class of investor that wants to be exposed to the whole market says <unk> <unk> assistant vice president at travelers investment management co \r\n the s&p futures are merely a cheaper and <unk> way to get access to all N stocks he says \r\n the big board yesterday began trading in its own basket trading vehicle representing the s&p N stocks \r\n but owning index futures is n't the same as owning the underlying stocks \r\n stockholders as a group can win because they own a share of corporate earnings which can grow and boost stock prices \r\n futures on the other hand are a zero sum game a market for making side bets about the direction of stock prices \r\n you do n't own anything says stephen boesel a money manager for t. rowe price in baltimore \r\n you 're making a pure bet on the market \r\n the european community commission challenged an agreement on routes and fares between france 's two largest airlines on antitrust grounds \r\n meeting in <unk> wednesday the commission voted as expected to formally object to the accord between air france the state-owned airline and state-controlled domestic carrier air <unk> \r\n an ec spokesman said the two companies will be notified so they can begin negotiations with brussels on how to modify the pact \r\n at issue is an accord dating back to march in which air france gained access to five domestic french routes under air <unk> 's flight numbers and the domestic airline got to fly to five cities outside of france under the flag of air france \r\n the two shared results from this route swap and followed rules on ticket pricing \r\n the ec commission decided that such an accord does n't benefit consumers enough to merit an exemption from antitrust law \r\n the airlines presented it as offering consumers more choice and better flight connections \r\n an air france spokeswoman said we 're absolutely ready to study all solutions \r\n an air <unk> spokesman said because they the ec have doubts we will work again on the text and the

exposure \r\n the judge handling the case in state supreme court a trial court had <unk> out the jury <unk> ruling that the matter should have been handled under federal <unk> safety and health administration rules \r\n but the appellate division of state supreme court held that federal law did n't <unk> the states from such a prosecution \r\n elizabeth <unk> district attorney for brooklyn n.y. said the appellate division has agreed with our view that despite federal <unk> laws state prosecutors have the power to protect working people \r\n lawyers for the company and executives could n't be reached for comment \r\n the executives face five to N years in prison and fines of $ N or double the profit made by failing to comply with the rules \r\n the company could be fined a maximum of $ N or double the profit \r\n general motors corp. wants to buy as much as N N of jaguar plc marking its first <unk> in a possible <unk> battle against ford motor co. for control of the british car maker \r\n gm sought u.s. antitrust clearance last week to purchase more than $ N million worth of jaguar shares but does n't own any yet according to gm officials here and at the company 's detroit headquarters \r\n the no. N u.s. auto maker then wrote jaguar that it intends to go to that N N level once it wins the u.s. clearance to go beyond $ N million a jaguar spokesman said yesterday \r\n the gm move follows tuesday 's declaration by ford which holds an unwelcome N N stake in jaguar that it is prepared to bid for the entire company \r\n gm is close to completing a friendly deal with jaguar that is likely to involve an eventual N N stake and joint manufacturing ventures \r\n speculative investors betting on an imminent clash between ford and gm pushed up jaguar 's share price five pence eight u.s. cents to a <unk> N pence $ N in late trading on london 's stock exchange yesterday \r\n since tuesday the shares have gained nearly N N \r\n but an <unk> bidding war between the world 's top auto giants for britain 's leading luxury-car maker seems unlikely \r\n we will not go over a certain level said david n. <unk> ford 's vice president for finance at a news conference yesterday in dearborn mich \r\n there 's some price at which we 'd stop bidding \r\n he would n't specify what it was \r\n and powerful political pressures may convince the conservative government to keep its so-called golden share which limits any individual holding to N N until the restriction expires on dec. N N \r\n i really do n't see the government doing something that jaguar does n't want over the next N months said kenneth warren a conservative member of parliament and chairman of the select committee on trade and industry in britain 's house of commons \r\n the golden share is a single share but it is the magic share \r\n the government retained the single share after selling its stake in jaguar in N part of a <unk> practice of protecting former government-owned enterprises to <unk> criticism of privatization \r\n the N N restriction covers any would-be suitor british or foreign \r\n ford is willing to bid for N N of jaguar 's shares if both the government and jaguar shareholders agree to relax the anti-takeover barrier <unk> \r\n as jaguar 's biggest holder and britain 's biggest car maker ford could turn up the heat by <unk> a special shareholders ' meeting and urging holders to drop the limits early \r\n ford might succeed because many shareholders are speculators keen for a full bid or institutional investors unhappy over jaguar management 's handling of its current financial difficulties \r\n the government probably would n't give in readily to a hostile <unk> by ford however \r\n it has <unk> a golden share only once before during british petroleum co. 's # N billion $ N billion takeover of <unk> plc in N \r\n in wooing british lawmakers gm has pointed out that its willingness to settle for a minority stake would keep jaguar <unk> and independent \r\n this week the u.s. auto giant paid for N house of commons members and two house of <unk> members to fly to detroit and tour its operations there \r\n while the visit was unrelated to jaguar gm chairman roger smith answered the legislators ' questions about it over lunch tuesday \r\n he said jaguar should n't be <unk> by anyone else recalled one participant \r\n politics also influences the government 's thinking on the anti-takeover restriction \r\n the conservatives do n't <unk> jeopardize marginal <unk> seats in <unk> where jaguar has headquarters nor can the government easily back down on promised protection for a privatized company while it proceeds with controversial plans to <unk> most of britain 's water and electricity industries \r\n prime minister margaret thatcher might however be <unk> to any request by jaguar chairman sir john <unk> for the restriction 's early removal to let gm <unk> more than N N or mount a friendly suitor bid against ford \r\n in the end sir john rather than the government or jaguar shareholders may hold the key that <unk> the golden share \r\n swedish <unk> and <unk> group ab skf said its pretax profit rose N N to N billion kronor $ N million in the first nine months from one billion kronor $ N million in the corresponding period a year earlier \r\n skf said sales increased N N to N billion kronor from N billion \r\n earnings per share were N kronor compared with N kronor \r\n skf said demand for the group 's main product rolling bearings remained favorable in europe which accounts for slightly more than two-thirds of group sales \r\n latin american markets continued their recovery after a weak start to the year skf said \r\n the company said the situation in the u.s. is still uncertain as reduced production in the country 's automotive industry has resulted in weakened demand for rolling bearings \r\n analysts said skf 's results for the first nine months lived up to market expectations as brokerage firms had predicted a pretax profit of N billion to N billion kronor \r\n the three business areas engaged in rolling bearing operations continued to show favorable sales development \r\n sales of rolling bearings increased N N to N billion kronor from N billion kronor in the corresponding period the previous year \r\n we read with interest robert <unk> 's sept. N page-one article on robert redford the <unk> kid gets little respect around <unk> \r\n <unk> conversations with us mr. <unk> argued that mr. redford 's environmental views are at odds with utah residents \r\n this may have been true N years ago but times have changed even in utah \r\n mr. redford no longer stands out as an <unk> \r\n he has not changed but those around him have \r\n many of his views on the protection of <unk> areas <unk> and <unk> are now embraced by mainstream conservative <unk> \r\n recently some N environmental and <unk> groups representing such <unk> points of view as the sierra club the league of women voters and the national <unk> association joined together to request a <unk> of the environmentally <unk> central utah project \r\n while utah is not yet a haven for environmentalism public views toward the environment have significantly improved \r\n in one of the most conservative republican states in the entire nation the <unk> of robert redford 's neighbors is the real story that mr. <unk> missed \r\n <unk> <unk> sam <unk> gary <unk> <unk> city utah \r\n if mr. redford wanted to be accepted by the people of utah he should have taken an advisory role instead of one of forcing his personal preferences \r\n furthermore his actions <unk> that it is too damaging or costly for society to provide jobs through <unk> construction coal mining or to build roads for public safety because of the adverse impact on the environment but it is just fine and <unk> for him to transform a mountain high in the <unk> range into a ski resort \r\n it <unk> me he can <unk> his <unk> and greedy actions in utah \r\n an excellent environmental actor he is \r\n david <unk> <unk> student university of colorado <unk> <unk> \r\n mr. redford like it or not is like a <unk> system on a runaway truck kind of slowing it down into control \r\n he 's rich famous and <unk> and has the time to do something that not even the federal government will do \r\n mr. redford is slowing down a <unk> speeding <unk> known as the progress of <unk> \r\n personally i 'm glad there are people like him around to slow down the profit <unk> and those who are in such a blind hurry for something that may appear to benefit them in the immediate future not <unk> about the <unk> implications \r\n ron <unk> \r\n when president bush <unk> to costa rica today he 'll go with little of the fanfare that <unk> many of his foreign <unk> \r\n but the two-day trip still has managed to fuel controversy over his administration 's policies in central america \r\n some conservatives say mr. bush should n't make the trip during which he will participate in costa rica 's celebration of N years of democracy \r\n these critics object to mr. bush 's participation in a meeting that includes nicaraguan president daniel ortega among the guests \r\n in addition they argue he wo n't help washington 's standing in the region by <unk> the u.s. commitment to democracy less than a month after his administration played an <unk> role in the failed coup attempt in panama \r\n i believe it will do more damage than good because it will <unk> people like daniel ortega says <unk> windsor who served as u.s. ambassador to costa rica during the reagan administration \r\n mr. windsor among other analysts connected to the conservative heritage foundation fears the gathering of N leaders mostly from central american nations will force mr. bush to explain and redeem himself in the wake of charges that the u.s. failed to do enough to aid the removal of panamanian dictator manuel noriega \r\n at the same time liberal and moderate democrats note the irony of mr. bush 's joining a celebration of costa rican democracy at a time his administration has sought sharp cuts in u.s. aid to the tiny country \r\n the administration proposed only $ N million in so-called economic support funds for costa rica this year down from the $ N million the u.s. provided last year \r\n the administration said improvements in costa rica 's economic condition warrant the cut in aid which the country uses mainly to make payments on its $ N billion foreign debt \r\n but costa rican officials argue that the recent drop in coffee prices combined with the country 's continuing struggle to <unk> its economy make the support as necessary as ever \r\n we are crossing the river and we need a little more help to get to the other side said <unk> <unk> an economic affairs specialist at the costa rican embassy in washington \r\n democrats argue that costa rica deserves more assistance for the same reason that mr. bush is attending the celebration this weekend to reward the country for its stability in a region <unk> with turmoil and for its efforts to promote peace in nicaragua \r\n however peace efforts by costa rican president <unk> arias have n't always helped the country 's cause in washington \r\n mr. arias 's <unk> refusal to support the u.s. 's campaign against leftist nicaragua earned him the <unk> of the reagan white house \r\n and more recently he insisted on signing a <unk> agreement intended to <unk> nicaragua 's <unk> contra rebels faster than the bush administration would prefer \r\n i think bush 's going there is a helpful sign said sen. terry sanford d. n.c a member of the foreign relations committee who pushed to provide costa rica about the same amount of aid as it received last year \r\n lawmakers in both houses support the higher level \r\n administration officials defend mr. bush 's decision to make the trip \r\n while they acknowledge the president will attend several meals and a working session also attended by mr. ortega they insist that mr. bush wo n't be extending the nicaraguan leader any special <unk> \r\n the administration also made clear its continuing <unk> for the leftist nicaraguan government in recent days <unk> a package of electoral aid to the nicaraguan opposition renewing the u.s. trade <unk> against the country and continuing to complain that the country supports rebel groups in the region \r\n officials also insist mr. bush will use the trip to highlight his own initiatives for pushing democracy in the region fighting illegal drugs and <unk> the less developed countries \r\n let me say there is a <unk> component to this trip secretary of state james baker told reporters wednesday \r\n there wo n't be any formal resolutions or <unk> i do n't think \r\n but we still see this as an opportunity to discuss many many very important issues \r\n in N the presidents commission of the ncaa which oversees most u.s. <unk> sports contracted with the washington-based american institutes for research to do a survey on the college <unk> of what the body chooses to call <unk> \r\n a brief executive summary was issued last april and attracted some but not much attention \r\n <unk> reports followed and attracted even less notice \r\n i suspect i may be one of the few people to have read them all \r\n the sixth and last report now is out and it puts the effort in perspective \r\n titled comments from students it focuses on the real shame of college sports what happens to young athletes once they enter <unk> \r\n it 's little less than a cry for help from those who make the costly show possible \r\n the previous five reports were mainly statistical but clear enough in <unk> \r\n they showed that participants in division i football and men 's basketball the big-time revenue sports entered school with poorer high-school grades and test scores than <unk> <unk> and students who participated in other <unk> activities and they got lower grades once they got there at least partly because of the athletic demands placed on them \r\n the football and basketball players spent more time on their sports in season than they did on class attendance and <unk> combined N hours a week <unk> N \r\n almost half N N reported suffering mental abuse from coaches and almost <unk> N N said they had been pressured to ignore injuries \r\n but even those numbers do n't describe the situation as well as the athletes do in their own words \r\n the composite portrait that emerges is n't of a <unk> <unk> marking time until he can land a <unk> pro contract he 's part of a tiny minority \r\n rather it 's of a kid we 're talking about N to N year <unk> here having a tough time making the best of what will probably be his one shot at college \r\n the <unk> question coming at the end of a lengthy confidential <unk> was this are there things about your college life you would like to tell us that we did n't ask about \r\n of the almost N athletes surveyed N took the time to respond \r\n here are a few of their answers they say that i am a <unk> but really i 'm an <unk> \r\n they <unk> to me on the recruiting trip \r\n football is the no. N thing here \r\n junior football player \r\n being a <unk> at college is a lot different from high school \r\n first the sport you play is no longer a game it becomes a job \r\n your coaches demand a lot more out of you even though some of them are not willing to take the time to watch you progress \r\n you become <unk> \r\n your interest is not taken to heart because people only care about your performance \r\n freshman basketball player \r\n the coaches should have a more personal and sympathetic attitude toward the athletes not treat us like pieces of meat \r\n they always say to get a degree first but they do n't allow us time or to <unk> practice to study for a test \r\n they just want to get their job done at any cost to the <unk> \r\n freshman football player \r\n the pressure put on us to win at all times has resulted in physical violence such as <unk> and <unk> by coaches \r\n some days the coaches make you feel as though you are part of a large <unk> of animals \r\n in other words they treat you like a piece of meat \r\n <unk> football player \r\n playing <unk> sports does n't give you a lot of time to spend with others \r\n we are almost left out of campus social activities \r\n this mostly happens because we go from football in the fall to lifting in the winter to football again in the spring \r\n freshman football player \r\n you talk about free time <unk> free time \r\n time to relax and enjoy ourselves is always taken up by something to do with football meetings lifting <unk> <unk> or films \r\n there is no recovery period it 's go go go \r\n abuse to our bodies is overwhelming \r\n with our schedule it 's hard to sleep well knowing what is going to happen the next day \r\n junior football player \r\n physical <unk> and depression are common in my life and in some of my <unk> ' lives \r\n football player class unspecified \r\n more often than not college athletes go through college never really experiencing <unk> life to the <unk> \r\n one has to establish one 's own identity away from athletics and make athletics only a part not a whole of the <unk> 's life \r\n <unk> basketball player \r\n somehow and i do n't know how the game needs to be played for fun again and not for the big bowl revenues or lucrative tv contracts \r\n <unk> football player \r\n there have been <unk> that at long last changes may be in the works \r\n the knight foundation of <unk> ohio has established a national commission to look into <unk> reform and the ncaa presidents commission earlier this month recommended cutting spring football practice in half moving the start of basketball practice back by a month and reducing maximum schedules in that sport to N games from N \r\n the key word in that <unk> though is may \r\n ncaa executive director richard <unk> in accepting a place on the knight commission urged that the panel take a balanced view which looks for all the world like a plea not to rock the boat too much and the presidents ' recommendations could face considerable opposition at the ncaa 's full convention in january which will vote on them \r\n i read that one <unk> athletics director predicted that the <unk> proposal could fail because of real world <unk> economic considerations \r\n but the real world also includes the <unk> truth that colleges are cheating the athletes they have <unk> and won \r\n if they wo n't change their ways voluntarily maybe somebody bigger congress should make them \r\n they want <unk> <unk> to the <unk> labs \r\n they want a 24-hour library \r\n and like college <unk> everywhere they are talking about a demonstration where protesters would gather quietly near the science building and raise their hands classroom style \r\n such is the fiber of the <unk> that <unk> intellectuals let fly at <unk> of harvard university 's new society of <unk> and <unk> or song \r\n <unk> are mad as <unk> about campus <unk> and they are n't going to take it anymore at least not without trying a few really neat ideas first \r\n we could have called ourselves the academic intellectual society but then everyone would have said oh you mean the <unk> club <unk> <unk> song 's <unk> adviser told N <unk> at the club 's <unk> meeting earlier this month \r\n membership has since swelled to between N and N \r\n some people may think of <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> individuals with <unk> <unk> for their pencils and a <unk> with computers and matters <unk> \r\n <unk> by at least one definition are <unk> circus <unk> \r\n but song founder <unk> <unk> a harvard junior thinks of <unk> and <unk> more as <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> \r\n one of the group 's first projects is a <unk> hot line that students could call when they have an urge to delay studying \r\n the club plans to show <unk> movies such as real <unk> in which physics <unk> pop corn with <unk> and naturally the <unk> of the <unk> a tale of college males with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> \r\n one of its more ambitious goals is to get <unk> <unk> the los angeles high-school <unk> teacher featured in the film stand and deliver to come to harvard for a guest <unk> \r\n <unk> and <unk> sometimes find themselves a bit isolated at harvard \r\n so mr. <unk> says high priority is being given to creating a computerized <unk> service where instead of being matched for eye color you could be matched for similar intellectual interests \r\n for instance \r\n i 'm a <unk> major but i want to know about <unk> \r\n hopefully i 'd find someone in <unk> who wanted to know more about <unk> \r\n it could work \r\n meanwhile finding a volunteer to write the computer program is n't a problem \r\n <unk> savings bank of new york was cleared by the federal deposit insurance corp. to acquire <unk> savings bank of

alternative fuels that do n't <unk> as much as fuel refined from heavy <unk> generally high in <unk> \r\n over the years the world 's stream of oil has been growing heavier \r\n so the scramble is on

\r\n venezuela has also earmarked $ N million in new money for <unk> exploration \r\n and some oil companies are trying to lock in future supplies \r\n typical is <unk> <unk> <unk> italy 's

for the cleaner fuels that will be required says john h. <unk> the president of the petroleum industry research foundation \r\n it will go for work ranging from refinery <unk> to changes in the distribution system including the way service stations pump fuel into cars \r\n in the u.s. the search for oil had been headed toward environmentally sensitive areas believed to have vast reserves \r\n alaska 's arctic national wildlife refuge alone is thought to hide more than three billion barrels of oil \r\n until the tanker spill big oil was slowly convincing authorities it could <unk> produce from such places \r\n now the wildlife refuge has been closed to the industry possibly for years \r\n similarly a group of companies led by chevron corp. has been unable to pump oil found off

worsening economy leading reformers have drawn up a blueprint for change designed to push the nation much closer to a free-market system \r\n the proposals go far beyond the current and rather confused policies of perestroika mikhail gorbachev 's restructuring of the economy \r\n they lay out a clear timetable and <unk> for <unk> the system of setting prices breaking up huge industrial monopolies and putting unprofitable state-owned companies out of business \r\n they also address such <unk> subjects as the likelihood of unemployment and high inflation and recommend ways to soften

political topic is far more precise than the vague plans announced by mr. gorbachev in N and later dropped \r\n but the proposals also display political <unk> <unk> some of the most controversial ideas in cautious language so as not to <unk> powerful conservatives in the government who stand to lose out if they are implemented \r\n seeking a middle path between opponents of change and <unk> who demand overnight solutions the article advocates what it calls a <unk> approach \r\n the document is to be discussed at a conference of leading economists late this month and will probably be presented to the soviet parliament for consideration this year \r\n as <unk> draw up proposals for the next five-year plan which starts in N the blueprint represents a powerful first shot in what is likely to be a fierce battle over economic reform \r\n the authors make a gloomy assessment of the economy and concede that quick and easy <unk> to success simply do n't exist \r\n instead they <unk> out a strategy in several <unk> from now until N \r\n most of the measures would probably only start to have an effect on beleaguered soviet consumers in two to three years at the earliest \r\n the key steps <unk> include property \r\n rigid ideological restrictions on property ownership should be abandoned \r\n the document proposes breaking up the <unk> system of state-owned enterprises and farms and allowing a big private sector to <unk> helped by tough <unk> legislation \r\n the economy would be thrown open to numerous types of ownership between now and N including factories leased by workers or owned by shareholders cooperatives and joint ventures \r\n some forms of private property would be <unk> \r\n such moves would greatly reduce the power of government ministries who now <unk> guard their turf and are seen as one of the major obstacles blocking economic reform \r\n finances \r\n emergency measures would be introduced to ease the country 's financial crisis notably its $ N billion budget deficit \r\n by the end of next year all <unk> state enterprises would be put out of business or handed over to workers who would buy or lease them or turn them into cooperatives \r\n similar steps would be taken to liquidate unprofitable state and collective farms by the end of N \r\n a unified system of taxation should be introduced rapidly \r\n to <unk> up some of the N billion rubles in circulation the government should encourage home ownership including issuing bonds that guarantee holders the right to purchase an apartment \r\n labor \r\n a genuine market for labor and wages would replace the present rigid <unk> system \r\n <unk> from decades of soviet <unk> the new system would lead to big differences in pay between workers and almost certainly to unemployment \r\n to cushion the <unk> the government would introduce a minimum wage and unemployment benefits \r\n prices \r\n the entire system of <unk> set prices would be <unk> and free-market prices introduced for most wholesale trade and some retail trade \r\n consumers would still be able to buy some food and household goods at subsidized prices but luxury and imported items including food would be sold at market prices \r\n wholesale prices would be divided into three categories raw materials sold at fixed prices close to world levels <unk> procurement prices for a small number of key products and free prices for everything else to be determined by contracts between suppliers and purchasers \r\n inflation-adjusted social benefits would ensure that the poor and elderly do n't suffer <unk> \r\n foreign trade \r\n the current <unk> and <unk> of foreign trade would be taken much further \r\n soviet companies would face fewer obstacles for exports and could even invest their hard currency abroad \r\n foreigners would receive greater incentives to invest in the u.s.s.r. \r\n alongside the current <unk> ruble a second currency would be introduced that could be freely exchanged for dollars and other western currencies \r\n a domestic foreign exchange market would be set up as part of an overhaul of the nation 's banking system \r\n the blueprint is at its <unk> when referring to the fate of the two powerful economic institutions that seem likely to oppose such sweeping plans the state planning committee known as <unk> and the state committee for material supply or <unk> \r\n but it hints strongly that both organizations would increasingly lose their clout as the changes particularly the introduction of wholesale trade and the breakup of state monopolies take effect \r\n ready willing and unable i always lift the <unk> when my car does n't start if <unk> at home do n't work i <unk> take them apart \r\n i 'll admit there 's nothing wrong that i ever do find but it 's nice when people say i appear <unk> inclined \r\n <unk> adams \r\n <unk> shock \r\n at the movies today in detail you see what the <unk> would n't show in <unk> three \r\n robert gordon \r\n <unk> comment \r\n do n't worry people will learn to read as long as there are tv program listings \r\n john <unk> \r\n albert engelken and robert thomson had never met though for N years their lives had been <unk> in a way <unk> to the sports world \r\n mr. engelken now a <unk> executive in washington d.c. and mr. thomson a <unk> salesman in <unk> n.j. had n't even talked to each other \r\n but one recent day they became much closer \r\n mr. engelken a <unk> baseball fan <unk> over the sports pages to chart the <unk> of my favorite and <unk> teams and players \r\n he often <unk> he says at the clutter of sports stories about drugs alcohol gambling and some player 's <unk> about the <unk> millions he is offered to play the game \r\n his morning paper the washington post even carries a sports column called <unk> that <unk> the latest <unk> and convictions of players and team managers \r\n like many sports <unk> mr. engelken has turned <unk> \r\n but his is a story about a hero in an era of sports <unk> and about what <unk> ruth mr. engelken <unk> us once called the only real game in the world \r\n to mr. engelken it is also a story about love because i 'm <unk> to have a wife who still thinks her slightly <unk> husband 's <unk> birthday deserves the ultimate present \r\n to understand what mr. engelken means one must go back to a <unk> october afternoon in N at new york 's <unk> grounds stadium where it can be argued the most dramatic moment in baseball history was played out \r\n it was the ninth inning of the third game of a <unk> <unk> between the brooklyn <unk> and the new york giants the predecessor to the san francisco giants scheduled to play in tonight 's world series \r\n baseball fans throughout new york had <unk> out a long summer with their teams and now it had come to this a battle between the two for the national league <unk> down to the last inning of the last game no less \r\n some N fans <unk> the stands and shouted at the top of their <unk> \r\n mr. engelken was doing the same across the hudson river in new jersey where with his nose pressed against the front window of the <unk> national bank he watched the <unk> on a television set the bank set up for the event \r\n the <unk> series had <unk> the <unk> giants fan \r\n the giants struck first winning the <unk> N on a <unk> homer off <unk> <unk> ralph <unk> mr. engelken recalls with precision today \r\n the giants got <unk> in the second game N and trailed N going into the bottom of the ninth of the third and deciding game \r\n the giants scored once and had <unk> on second <unk> <unk> and third <unk> <unk> as bobby thomson advanced to the plate \r\n the rest as they say is history \r\n mr. thomson a tall <unk> <unk> <unk> stepped into the <unk> 's box \r\n thomson took a called strike mr. engelken <unk> \r\n the tension mounted as ralph <unk> again on the <unk> <unk> down the <unk> \r\n he wound up and let loose a <unk> \r\n the pitch <unk> toward bobby thomson high and inside and then with a crack of the bat was sent <unk> back into the lower <unk> stands \r\n giants fans went into euphoria says mr. engelken \r\n and bobby thomson was made a <unk> \r\n the same bobby thomson it turns out who sells those <unk> today \r\n there ca n't be an older baseball fan alive who does n't clearly remember that bobby thomson homer who ca n't tell you where he was when he heard the famous <unk> <unk> radio broadcast the one that concluded with mr. <unk> shouting over and over the giants win the <unk> the giants win the <unk> \r\n mr. engelken and mr. thomson drifted in different <unk> in the subsequent years and the <unk> grounds located under <unk> 's <unk> in upper manhattan was replaced by a <unk> project \r\n mr. thomson played <unk> and third base until N posting a lifetime N <unk> average and <unk> up N home runs before retiring and going into <unk> sales \r\n mr. engelken moved south to washington but he took with him <unk> memories of the homer of N \r\n when his wife <unk> came down the <unk> on their <unk> day in N mr. engelken no <unk> on the romantic front gave her the ultimate <unk> you look <unk> than bobby thomson 's home run \r\n the couple 's first dog homer was named after the great event though <unk> friends assumed he was the <unk> of the <unk> \r\n and when mr. engelken 's sister <unk> who was born two days before the home run reached her <unk> birthday mr. engelken wrote his sports hero to tell him of the <unk> of events \r\n mr. thomson sent off a card to <unk> it does n't seem like N years since i hit that home run to <unk> your birth it read \r\n <unk> was pleased but nowhere near as much as mr. engelken \r\n the family license plate reads <unk> N the first three letters of the family name and no surprise here bobby thomson 's uniform number \r\n and on mr. engelken 's <unk> birthday his wife bought a book detailing the big homer and sent it off to mr. thomson to be <unk> \r\n what could have been better asks mr. engelken \r\n <unk> engelken asked the same question earlier this year when her husband was about to turn N \r\n she had an idea \r\n on her husband 's <unk> birthday after an <unk> N years of marriage it should be noted <unk> al and their <unk> son set out for new york to visit <unk> university \r\n mrs. engelken had scheduled a stop on the new jersey turnpike to she told her husband pick up some papers for a neighbor \r\n the papers would be handed over at a bank of telephone <unk> just off exit N \r\n it sounded like something out of ian fleming mr. engelken recalls \r\n at the appointed exit the family pulled over and mrs. engelken went to get her papers \r\n mr. engelken turned off the motor and rolled down the window \r\n in a matter of minutes she was back with a tall <unk> man in <unk> \r\n she <unk> down by the car window and addressed her husband with her favorite <unk> \r\n <unk> she said happy <unk> birthday \r\n this is bobby thomson \r\n and there he was recalls mr. engelken \r\n the hero of my youth the one person in history i 'd most like to meet \r\n keep your thomas <unk> or st. <unk> or <unk> i 'd take baseball 's flying <unk> without <unk> \r\n they talked of the home run \r\n i thought it was in the upper deck said bobby thomson now N years old \r\n they talked of the aftermath \r\n i never thought it would become so <unk> bobby <unk> \r\n mr. engelken says his wife was <unk> by the whole thing \r\n it was worth it just for the look on albert 's face \r\n the two men spent an hour at exit N <unk> the event <unk> the <unk> dream of a young boy now turned N mr. engelken says \r\n his hero signed photographs of the homer and <unk> called ralph <unk> a very fine <unk> \r\n and when mr. engelken asked him why he took time off from work for somebody he did n't even know bobby thomson replied you know albert if you have the chance in life to make somebody this happy you have an obligation to do it \r\n in an interview mr. thomson who is married and has three grown children says he has few ties to baseball these days other than playing <unk> games now and again \r\n but his fans to his constant <unk> never let him forget the famous <unk> \r\n his mail regularly recalls my one event and has been growing in recent years \r\n in response to the letters mr. thomson usually sends an <unk> photo with a <unk> note and rarely <unk> a <unk> \r\n but when <unk> engelken wrote him saying she could stop near his new jersey home it seemed different \r\n what a good feeling it would be for me to do that he says he thought \r\n when the engelken family got back from its trip up north mr. engelken wrote it all down just to make sure no detail was missed \r\n on the way home his notes recall it took concentrated effort to keep that car pointed south \r\n my mind was miles north at a place called <unk> 's <unk> where a real sports hero had captured the <unk> of a kid who never fully grew up and is all the richer for it \r\n take heart sports fans he wrote \r\n real heroes exist \r\n you might not find one in the <unk> column \r\n but who knows \r\n you might meet up with him at that bank of telephone <unk> just off exit N of the new jersey turnpike \r\n southam inc. said its unprofitable weekly newspaper the financial times of canada is up for sale \r\n analysts said the announcement the latest in a series of <unk> and restructuring moves is aimed at improving southam 's earnings before the expiration in june of a standstill pact with <unk> corp \r\n when that agreement expires <unk> will be free to increase its N N stake in southam or to make an offer for the whole company \r\n <unk> of the southam family hold an additional N N stake in the toronto-based company canada 's largest newspaper publisher \r\n the newspaper could fetch between N million and N million canadian dollars us$ N million to $ N million said one analyst who asked not to be identified \r\n a spokesman for southam declined to comment on the price the company is seeking or on estimates of the paper 's annual losses which most analysts place at between c$ N million and c$ N million \r\n yesterday southam reported third-quarter earnings of c$ N million on revenue of c$ N million down from c$ N million on revenue of c$ N million in the year-ago quarter \r\n to be profitable the paper requires more circulation and building circulation is an expensive undertaking said john <unk> the paper 's publisher \r\n southam said the level of future investment required by the paper would have restricted its options in other areas \r\n the acquisition of the financial times of canada is well within reach for any number of media companies both public and private said james <unk> an analyst with toronto-based <unk> james capel inc \r\n possible bidders include christopher <unk> a toronto financier and vice chairman of hees international bancorp inc. a holding company controlled by toronto 's bronfman family \r\n mr. <unk> sold his stake in <unk> corp. to hees earlier this year and is said to be seeking a media acquisition \r\n mr. <unk> could n't be reached for comment but roy <unk> chairman of <unk> media a closely held concern that publishes two business magazines said his company would take a close look at the newspaper \r\n mr. <unk> said the sale of the <unk> financial times which southam has owned since N is consistent with southam 's strategy of cutting costs to obtain maximum profits from its operations while <unk> of <unk> <unk> assets \r\n southam agreed to sell its N N stake in <unk> communications ltd. a broadcasting concern to <unk> hunter ltd. for about c$ N million last year \r\n this year it has moved to cut costs in its newspaper division through layoffs and asset sales while reaching joint venture and acquisition agreements in other areas \r\n the financial times of canada has no links to the british daily newspaper the financial times \r\n norton co. said net income for the third quarter fell N N to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or $ N a share \r\n operating profit for the <unk> engineering materials and petroleum services concern was $ N million or N cents a share up N N from $ N million or N cents a share \r\n the company had a tax credit of $ N million \r\n in the year-earlier quarter the tax credit was $ N million \r\n sales rose N N to $ N million from $ N million \r\n operating profit in the company 's <unk> segment rose N N while operating profit in the engineering materials segment rose N N \r\n however the company 's petroleum services segment while profitable was hurt by high financing costs associated with the company 's buy-out of a N N stake in eastman <unk> co. from texas eastern corp. last june \r\n norton and texas eastern had each held a N N stake in eastman in a joint venture \r\n norton announced earlier this month that it was exploring the possible sale of all or part of eastman <unk> \r\n for the nine months norton had net of $ N million or $ N a share and a tax credit of $ N million \r\n in the year-earlier period the company had net of $ N million or $ N a share and a tax credit of $ N million \r\n norton had operating profit of $ N million or $ N a share up N N from $ N million or $ N a share \r\n sales rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion \r\n <unk> park and her family <unk> for four years to buy a tiny apartment here but found that the closer they got to saving the $ N they originally needed the more the price rose \r\n by this month it had more than doubled \r\n now the <unk> <unk> whose husband earns a modest salary as an assistant professor of economics is saving harder than ever \r\n i am determined to get an apartment in three years she says \r\n it 's all i think about or talk about \r\n for the parks and millions of other young koreans the <unk> dream of home ownership has become a <unk> illusion \r\n for the government it has become a highly volatile political issue \r\n last may a government panel released a report on the extent and causes of the problem \r\n during the past N years the report showed housing prices increased nearly <unk> \r\n the report laid the blame on speculators who it said had pushed land prices up <unk> \r\n the panel found that since N real-estate prices rose nearly N N in a speculative fever fueled by economic prosperity the N seoul olympics and the government 's pledge to rapidly develop korea 's southwest \r\n the result is that those rich enough to own any real estate at all have boosted their holdings substantially \r\n for those with no holdings the prospects of buying a home are ever <unk> \r\n in N a quarter of the population owned N N of the nation 's N square <unk> of private land the report said and N N of the population owned N N of the land devoted to housing \r\n meanwhile the government 's land bureau reports that only about a third of korean families own their own homes \r\n <unk> have soared along with house prices \r\n former national <unk> hong <unk> now a radio <unk> says the problem is <unk> for many people \r\n i 'm afraid of a popular <unk> if this situation is n't corrected he adds \r\n in fact during the past three months there have been several demonstrations at the office complex where the land bureau is <unk> and at the national assembly demanding the government put a stop to real-estate speculation \r\n president roh <unk> woo 's administration has been studying the real-estate crisis for the past year with an eye to partial land <unk> \r\n last week the government took three bills to the national assembly \r\n the proposed legislation is aimed at <unk> some of the <unk> in the current <unk> system \r\n <unk> of the bills as currently <unk> are a restriction on the amount of real estate one family can own to N square <unk> in the nation 's six largest cities but more in smaller cities and rural areas \r\n the government will <unk> offenders but wo n't <unk> property \r\n a tax of between N N and N N on property holdings that exceed the <unk> ceiling \r\n taxes of between N N and N N a year on excessive profits from the resale of property or the sale of idle land to the government \r\n the government <unk> excessive profits as those above the average realized for other <unk> properties in an area \r\n grace periods ranging from two to five years before the full scope of the penalties takes effect \r\n the administration says the measures would stem rampant property speculation free more land for the government 's ambitious <unk> program designed to build two million apartments by N and perhaps boost the popular standing of president roh \r\n but opposition legislators and others calling for help for south korea 's <unk> say the proposed changes do n't go far enough to make it possible for ordinary people to buy a home \r\n some want lower limits on house <unk> others insist on <unk> higher taxation for larger homes and lots \r\n the citizens coalition for economic justice a <unk> group leading the charge for radical reform wants restrictions on <unk> high taxation of capital gains and drastic revamping of the <unk> system on which property taxes are based \r\n but others large <unk> real-estate developers and business leaders say the government 's proposals are <unk> \r\n led by the federation of korean industries the critics are lobbying for the government to weaken its proposed restrictions and penalties \r\n government officials who are urging real-estate reforms <unk> at the arguments of business leaders and <unk> at their pressure \r\n there is no violation of the <unk> principle of private property in what we are doing says lee <unk> <unk> director of the government 's land bureau which drafted the bills \r\n but he adds the constitution <unk> the government to impose some controls to <unk> the shortage of land \r\n the land available for housing construction stands at about N square <unk> a person N N lower than in taiwan and only about half that of japan \r\n mr. lee estimates that about N property speculators are operating in south korea \r\n the chief <unk> he says are big companies and business groups that buy huge amounts of land not for their corporate use but for resale at huge profit \r\n one research institute calculated that as much as N N of <unk> land is held by N companies and that as little as N N of that is used for business \r\n the government 's office of bank supervision and examination told the national assembly this month that in the first half of N the nation 's N largest business groups bought real estate valued at $ N billion \r\n the ministry of finance as a result has proposed a series of measures that would restrict business investment in real estate even more tightly than restrictions aimed at individuals \r\n under those measures financial institutions would be restricted from owning any more real estate than they need for their business operations \r\n banks investment and credit firms would be permitted to own land equivalent in value to N N of their capital currently the proportion is N N \r\n the maximum <unk> property holdings for insurance companies would be reduced to N N of their total asset value down from N N currently \r\n but mrs. park acknowledges that even if the policies work to slow or stop speculation apartment prices are unlikely to go down \r\n at best she <unk> they will rise more slowly more slowly she hopes than her family 's income \r\n <unk> corp. <unk> n.j. declared its initial quarterly of five cents a share payable dec. N to stock of record nov. N \r\n the maker of specialty chemicals has about N million shares outstanding \r\n the company said the move recognizes its strong financial position \r\n although profits were squeezed in N mainly as a result of higher <unk> costs the company said it is confident about future earnings and cash flow for N and beyond \r\n in national over-the-counter trading yesterday <unk> shares rose N cents to close at $ N a share \r\n the justice department said it is seeking to join a private lawsuit challenging a pittsburgh suburb 's <unk> ordinance that sharply restricts the locations available to group homes for the handicapped \r\n this would be the department 's first suit challenging a local <unk> ordinance under N amendments to the fair housing act \r\n under those amendments which took effect in march of this year the federal government can intervene in private <unk> lawsuits \r\n the ordinance in moon township prohibits <unk> a group home for the handicapped within a mile of another such facility \r\n in papers filed with the federal district court in pittsburgh the justice department alleged that the ordinance by limiting the number of group homes that can be established in the township makes housing unavailable on account of <unk> \r\n the private suit was brought by three <unk> <unk> people who live in a group home in moon \r\n <unk> smith moon township manager said the ordinance is intended to prevent the concentration of group homes for the <unk> <unk> from changing the character and flavor of the neighborhood \r\n he said the ordinance also will benefit the <unk> <unk> \r\n our intent is to spread them out to insure they are well integrated into the community he said \r\n energetic and concrete action has been taken in colombia during the past N days against the <unk> of the drug trade but it has not been sufficiently effective because unfortunately it came too late \r\n ten years ago the newspaper el espectador of which my brother <unk> was editor began warning of the rise of the drug <unk> and of their leaders ' aspirations to control colombian politics especially the congress \r\n then when it would have been easier to resist them nothing was done and my brother was murdered by the drug <unk> three years ago \r\n the most <unk> <unk> have not <unk> their press more <unk> than the drug <unk> <unk> colombia 's \r\n the censorship is <unk> through terrorism and assassination \r\n in the past N years about N journalists have been <unk> forever murdered \r\n within the past two months a bomb exploded in the offices of the el espectador in <unk> destroying a major part of its installations and equipment \r\n and only last week the newspaper <unk> liberal in the city of <unk> was <unk> and its installations destroyed \r\n journalists and their families are constantly threatened as are the newspaper distribution outlets \r\n distribution centers are <unk> and advertisers are <unk> \r\n censorship is imposed by terrorism \r\n if the colombian media accept this new and <unk> censorship there is little doubt that the drug mafia 's terrorism someday will extend to all the newspapers published in the free world \r\n the solidarity of the <unk> media world-wide against drug terrorism is the only way press freedom can survive \r\n the american people and their government also <unk> up too late to the <unk> drugs posed to the moral structure of their country \r\n even now the american attack upon this tremendous problem is <unk> in <unk> to the magnitude of the threat \r\n i can <unk> that a recent colombian <unk> to the u.s. was offered drugs three times in the few blocks ' walk between grand central terminal and the <unk> <unk> hotel in <unk> manhattan \r\n colombia alone its government its people its newspapers does not have the capacity to fight this battle successfully \r\n all <unk> countries must jointly decide to combat and punish the consumers and distributors of drugs \r\n the u.s. as the major drug consumer should lead this joint effort \r\n reduction if not the total <unk> of drug consumption is the requirement for victory \r\n much is being done in colombia to fight the drug <unk> mafia \r\n <unk> homes and <unk> have been <unk> by the military authorities and sophisticated and powerful communications equipment have been seized \r\n more than N planes and <unk> have been <unk> at airports and a large number of vehicles and <unk> has been confiscated \r\n the military has also captured enormous <unk> of powerful and sophisticated weapons <unk> and other <unk> <unk> \r\n much has been accomplished and public opinion <unk> supports the government and the army but on the other hand none of the key drug <unk> have been captured \r\n there has been a lot of talk that a large portion of the colombian economy is sustained by the laundering of drug money \r\n in my opinion this is not true \r\n <unk> drug money has served only to increase <unk> the price of real estate creating serious problems for low-income people who <unk> to own their own homes \r\n drug money has also gone to buy expensive cars airplanes <unk> and <unk> where drugs are consumed \r\n but most of the drug money is kept in investments and in financial institutions outside colombia \r\n in fact the cooperation of those financial institutions is essential to the success of the drug battle \r\n what is of much more importance to the colombian economy than the supposed benefits of <unk> drug money is higher prices for colombia 's legitimate products \r\n the price of coffee has gone down almost N N since the beginning of the year to the lowest level after inflation since the great depression \r\n market conditions point to even lower prices next year \r\n the <unk> coffee <unk> had to be formally <unk> this summer \r\n as a result colombia will earn $ N million less from its coffee this year than last \r\n our coffee growers face reductions in their income and this <unk> them to <unk> <unk> <unk> crops for coffee \r\n u.s. interests occasionally try to impose barriers to the import of another important colombian export cut flowers into the american market \r\n a just price and an open market for what colombian produces and exports should be the policy of the u.s. \r\n i take advantage of this opportunity given to me by the wall street journal to make a plea to the millions of readers of this newspaper to become soldiers dedicated to the fight against the use of drugs \r\n each <unk> of cocaine consumed is a deadly bullet against those in our country and in the rest of the world who fight this terrible <unk> \r\n a crusade of no to the consumption of drugs is <unk> \r\n mr. <unk> is president of el espectador a newspaper founded by his <unk> \r\n it has more drug users than boston has people \r\n <unk> thousand of its children live in foster homes while N residents have no homes at all \r\n its tax base is shrinking a $ N billion budget deficit looms and the city faces contract negotiations with all major municipal unions next year \r\n this is new york city \r\n when the dust and <unk> settle in an <unk> mayoral race the man most likely to gain custody of all this is a career politician named david dinkins \r\n running the nation 's largest and most <unk> city may be no treat but at least mr. dinkins knows what to expect from it \r\n as the campaign hits the home stretch however voters still have very little idea what they can expect from him \r\n after N years in city politics david dinkins remains an <unk> \r\n the <unk> <unk> manhattan borough president the first black man to win the democratic nomination for mayor here does n't have a single prominent political enemy \r\n while he is widely described as a man with deep convictions he has few major political programs that he can call his own \r\n asked about his greatest achievement in public life he first speaks about the quality of his staff \r\n now as election day <unk> even some supporters wonder what he will do if he wins the <unk> on nov. N \r\n they wonder whether he can be firm with his longtime allies including union leaders and political <unk> who may seek a place at the trough \r\n they wonder whether he has the economic know-how to steer the city through a possible fiscal crisis and they wonder who will be advising him \r\n will he if he wins be in the <unk> of the most liberal of his allies who advocate such policies as rent control for commercial buildings or will he tilt toward the real-estate interests that have <unk> money into his campaign \r\n after his decisive primary victory over mayor edward i. koch in september mr. dinkins <unk> until recently on a <unk> lead over his republican opponent rudolph giuliani the former crime <unk> who has proved a something of a <unk> as a candidate \r\n but mr. dinkins has <unk> in the past two weeks over his campaign 's payments to a black activist who is a convicted <unk> and over his handling of a stock sale to his son \r\n polls also have recorded some <unk> in mr. dinkins 's support among jewish voters and <unk> projections now put his lead at between four and N percentage points \r\n in an interview with reporters and editors of the wall street journal mr. dinkins appears quite confident of victory and of his ability to handle the <unk> \r\n a lot of people think i will give away the store but i can assure you i will not he says \r\n i am aware we have real budgetary problems \r\n the city is full of aging bridges water <unk> and roadways that are in need of billions of dollars worth of repair \r\n renewed efforts to fight drugs and crime will be costly \r\n but city officials say tax revenues are lagging \r\n and after a decade of explosive job growth on wall street a period of <unk> is under way \r\n mr. koch already has announced he will drop N jobs from the city payroll but that wo n't be enough \r\n new york state comptroller edward <unk> predicts a $ N billion budget gap for the city 's next fiscal year a gap that could grow if there is a recession \r\n if elected mr. dinkins will probably have no choice but to raise taxes on <unk> businesses or cut spending in already <unk> neighborhoods \r\n he is going to face a mess says city council president andrew stein \r\n his supporters are not <unk> but their solution to everything will be to spend more money and he wo n't have any money \r\n by and large mr. dinkins has <unk> the touchy question of whose <unk> he would <unk> \r\n instead of focusing on the financial future mr. dinkins has sold himself as a <unk> for a city recently touched by racial violence and as a <unk> <unk> to N years of <unk> generated by mayor koch \r\n the thing about the dinkins <unk> is that it offers hope to a broad range of people says <unk> <unk> a real-estate executive and former aide to gov. mario <unk> \r\n it is a <unk> <unk> \r\n no doubt mr. dinkins has been a <unk> influence \r\n he is an <unk> figure who <unk> the <unk> of colleagues ' children opens doors for women and almost never has a bad word to say about anybody \r\n more important he emerged as a <unk> last summer after the central park rape of a white <unk> in which a group of <unk> <unk> was charged and the racial murder of a black <unk> in the white brooklyn neighborhood of <unk> \r\n rather than scaring off white voters as many predicted he would mr. dinkins attracted many whites precisely because of his reputation for having a cool head \r\n keeping cool is a dinkins priority on <unk> days this summer he was known to change his <unk> suits as many as four times a day \r\n but even in his <unk> campaign he has shown signs of the <unk> and confusion that some say has plagued his tenure as manhattan borough president and might <unk> him as mayor \r\n over the last few weeks he has <unk> away roughly half of what was once a <unk> lead in the polls over mr. giuliani \r\n a story about how he <unk> the sale to his son of his stock in a media company controlled by his political <unk> <unk> sutton was allowed to <unk> a full week before mr. dinkins faced the media \r\n he has canceled numerous campaign appointments and was largely <unk> to the media until the stock story broke \r\n his campaign was caught <unk> amid allegations it paid almost $ N for what it said was a <unk> effort by black activist <unk> carson a convicted <unk> who later said publicly that he is <unk> \r\n critics have said the payment looked like an attempt by the dinkins camp to get mr. carson to stop leading <unk> demonstrations <unk> the <unk> murder protests the campaign may have feared could cause some white voters to turn from a black candidate \r\n mr. dinkins also has failed to <unk> jewish voters ' fears about his association with the rev. <unk> jackson despite the fact that few local <unk> politicians have been as <unk> for jewish causes in the past N years as mr. dinkins has \r\n these campaign problems have <unk> difficulties mr. dinkins has run into before \r\n a former u.s. marine mr. dinkins got off to a quick start in politics joining a local democratic political club in the 1950s linking up with black urban leaders such as charles <unk> <unk> paterson and mr. sutton and getting himself elected to the state assembly in N \r\n but his chance to become deputy mayor under mayor <unk> <unk> a plan boosted by mr. sutton was <unk> because of mr. dinkins 's failure still largely <unk> to file income tax returns for four years running \r\n i always thought of this as a thing that could always be done tomorrow he said at the time \r\n later mr. dinkins became more deeply <unk> to mr. sutton and other city <unk> including <unk> council president paul <unk> when they helped him get appointed city clerk a largely <unk> post responsible for the city 's marriage bureau among other things \r\n mr. <unk> is now one of the lawyers for mr. sutton 's media company \r\n the debt rose further in N when mr. sutton resigned his position as manhattan borough president to run for mayor \r\n mr. sutton recalls when i left i sat down with charlie <unk> <unk> paterson and david and david said who will run for borough president and i said you will \r\n david <unk> mayor koch 's longtime media adviser says of mr. dinkins he really is the <unk> of the <unk> system \r\n but the guy is so personally decent people tend to forget that \r\n mr. dinkins lost twice by wide margins before finally getting elected borough president in N \r\n but by most accounts he made little of the post and was best known among city politicians for his problems making up his mind on matters before the city 's board of estimate the body that votes on crucial budget and <unk> matters \r\n colleagues today recall with some humor how meetings would <unk> into the early morning hours as mr. dinkins would march his staff out of board meetings and into his private office to discuss en <unk> certain controversial proposals \r\n he taught me how to drink <unk> tea instead of coffee at N a.m. i 'll give him that says deputy mayor robert <unk> \r\n often mr. dinkins 's <unk> prevented him from having a say in the way things turned out critics claim \r\n on the campaign <unk> he often points out that he was the only board of estimate member to vote against a controversial real-estate project at manhattan 's columbus circle \r\n but board members say he took so long to decide how to vote that by the time he decided it was too late to try to draw other members to his position \r\n says one city official everybody else had brought in the <unk> and made their deal \r\n he would have got a lot more done if he made up his mind faster \r\n one board member bronx borough president ferdinand <unk> was said to be so <unk> with mr. dinkins 's behavior at many meetings that he withheld his support for mr. dinkins 's mayoral effort until late in the primary campaign \r\n i had some problem from time to time on the length of time he would take to make up his mind mr. <unk> admits but he maintains that he did n't delay his support of mr. dinkins and that he backs the democratic candidate <unk> \r\n mr. dinkins 's campaign manager and former chief of staff bill lynch denies that the manhattan borough president has taken too long to decide important issues \r\n we did n't <unk> everything that came to us mr. lynch says \r\n on some occasions when mr. dinkins has discussed the issues during the campaign he has run into a familiar kind of trouble \r\n some supporters were stunned this summer when mr. dinkins suggested weakening the law <unk> public employees to go on strike \r\n he withdrew the remark \r\n when he later <unk> with striking hospital workers some allies <unk> a little more concerned that mr. dinkins was setting the wrong tone for coming contract negotiations with city employees \r\n then two days before receiving an endorsement from environmental groups mr. dinkins promised he would issue a three-year <unk> on construction of <unk> plants \r\n that announcement was <unk> criticized by mayor koch who has endorsed mr. dinkins because the city faces a garbage crisis and has already spent $ N million planning for an incinerator that would be scrapped under mr. dinkins 's proposal \r\n while his public statements have at times been confusing mr. dinkins 's position papers have more consistently reflected <unk> sentiment \r\n he favors a form of commercial rent control which the financial community believes would make it more difficult to attract investment in the city \r\n in the midst of a labor shortage he proposes linking city subsidies to businesses to their record of hiring new york city residents \r\n with an <unk> local labor pool many experts believe that policy could drive businesses from the city \r\n and he favors a more cooperative approach toward the neighboring states of new jersey and connecticut in the battle over companies thinking of moving employees out of new york city \r\n many <unk> officials say the koch administration 's aggressive approach helped save N chase manhattan bank jobs from moving across the hudson \r\n but mr. dinkins 's economic <unk> do n't seem to bother the business community where he draws significant support \r\n steven <unk> president of the real estate board of new york an industry organization says mr. dinkins 's economic development program is <unk> but when it comes down to it he can be reasonable \r\n mr. dinkins 's inner circle of advisers appears to include both <unk> and <unk> leaving voters with little clue as to who will be more influential \r\n the key man seems to be the campaign manager mr. lynch \r\n a <unk> <unk> son of a long island potato farmer mr. lynch is a veteran union <unk> who worked on the presidential campaigns of sen. edward kennedy and mr. jackson \r\n but as the dinkins campaign hit tough times this month andrew <unk> the politically <unk> son of the new york governor is also said to have taken a more active role on strategy \r\n another close ally is ruth <unk> a manhattan city <unk> some of whose programs such as commercial rent control have made their way into mr. dinkins 's position papers \r\n if she remains influential with mr. dinkins as some suggest she will his <unk> may take on a more <unk> flavor \r\n but lincoln center president nathan leventhal who would head a dinkins transition team is more mainstream as is real-estate executive anthony <unk> another insider \r\n mr. dinkins also has said he would receive economic advice from a board that would include american express co. chairman james d. robinson iii investment banker <unk> <unk> <unk> specialist <unk> lewis and attorney joseph flom \r\n some business leaders and others also believe that mr. dinkins would place significant responsibility in the hands of a deputy mayor with a strong administrative background \r\n names of possible deputies that have surfaced include former mayoral candidate richard <unk> former schools chancellor frank <unk> and messrs. leventhal and <unk> \r\n then there are mr. dinkins 's <unk> <unk> colleagues such as u.s. rep. <unk> former deputy mayor paterson and mr. sutton \r\n having <unk> positions of real influence or wealth these men constitute the old guard of new york city black politics they are less <unk> than the younger more activist black political community that has been based largely in brooklyn \r\n part of mr. dinkins 's strength is his ability to win the support of both the brooklyn and <unk> <unk> \r\n we know there are <unk> for the city out there says mr. paterson mr. dinkins 's former law partner \r\n if any of us think we 're going to <unk> david 's determination to be the best possible mayor because of his obligations to us we are making a sad mistake \r\n adds ms. <unk> who is expected to win the borough president 's job mr. dinkins is <unk> you have to remember david is a <unk> \r\n but mr. dinkins 's sense of <unk> often comes across more as an insider 's determination not to upset the political apple <unk> \r\n he is taken <unk> in an interview when asked whether as mayor he plans on <unk> the political <unk> that <unk> the <unk> <unk> of new york 's school system \r\n i will sit down and talk some of the problems out but take on the political system <unk> he says with a shake of the head \r\n despite many doubts about his <unk> white new <unk> who gave mr. dinkins N N of their votes in the primary are n't expected to desert in sufficient numbers to turn the election to mr. giuliani \r\n the former u.s. attorney who prosecuted targets ranging from mafia <unk> to wall street executives has succeeded in raising questions about mr. dinkins 's ethical standards but so far has failed to generate excitement about his own <unk> \r\n as a republican in an <unk> democratic city mr. giuliani has an inherent <unk> \r\n as a first-time candidate he has been slow to learn the <unk> of new york city <unk> \r\n mr. giuliani is finding that mr. dinkins in his many years in public life has built up considerable good will that so far has led many voters to <unk> certain <unk> \r\n the bottom line is that he is a very genuine and decent guy says malcolm <unk> a jewish community leader \r\n in the end i think david will be <unk> for being david \r\n <unk> johnson pulls a tape measure across the front of what was once a <unk> <unk> home \r\n a deep <unk> now runs along its north wall exposed when the house <unk> two feet off its foundation during last week 's earthquake \r\n a side <unk> was <unk> away \r\n the <unk> is a pile of bricks on the front lawn \r\n the remainder of the house <unk> <unk> against a <unk> oak tree \r\n the <unk> <unk> ms. johnson dressed in jeans and a <unk> as she <unk> through the steady afternoon rain is a claims adjuster with aetna life & casualty \r\n she has been on the move almost <unk> since last thursday when an army of adjusters employed by major insurers <unk> the san francisco area to help policyholders <unk> through the rubble and restore some order to their lives \r\n equipped with cellular telephones laptop computers <unk> and a pack of blank checks they parcel out money so their clients can find temporary living quarters buy food replace lost clothing repair broken water <unk> and <unk> walls \r\n some of the funds will used to <unk> unstable buildings and clear sites for future construction \r\n many adjusters are authorized to write checks for amounts up to $ N on the spot \r\n they do n't <unk> at writing them \r\n that 's my job get policyholders what they 're entitled to says bill schaeffer a claims supervisor who flew in from aetna 's <unk> conn. office \r\n the <unk> house that ms. johnson is <unk> has been deemed <unk> by town officials \r\n but she asks a <unk> <unk> the bricks from the lawn to give her a boost through an open <unk> window \r\n once inside she spends nearly four hours measuring and <unk> each room in the <unk> house gathering enough information to estimate what it would cost to rebuild it \r\n she <unk> photos of the <unk> floors and the <unk> that has fallen away from the walls \r\n while she works inside a <unk> returns with several friends to collect furniture and clothing \r\n one of the friends <unk> broken <unk> and shattered glass from a <unk> and starts to pack what can be <unk> from the kitchen \r\n others grab books records photo <unk> <unk> and chairs working <unk> in the fear that an <unk> will jolt the house again \r\n the owners william and <unk> hammack are <unk> than many others \r\n a few years ago mrs. hammack insisted on buying earthquake insurance for this house which had been converted into apartments \r\n only about N N of california home and business owners carried earthquake coverage \r\n the <unk> ' own home also in los <unk> suffered <unk> minor damage \r\n ms. johnson who works out of aetna 's office in <unk> creek an east bay suburb is <unk> by the earthquake 's <unk> force \r\n it really brings you down to a human level she says \r\n it 's hard to accept all the suffering people are going through but you have to \r\n if you do n't you ca n't do your job \r\n for aetna and other insurers the san francisco earthquake hit when resources in the field already were stretched \r\n most companies still are trying to sort through the <unk> caused by hurricane hugo in the carolinas last month \r\n aetna which has nearly N adjusters had deployed about N of them in charlotte columbia and charleston \r\n adjusters who had been working on the east coast say the insurer will still be processing claims from that storm through december \r\n it could take six to nine months to handle the earthquake-related claims \r\n when the earthquake rocked northern california last week aetna senior claims executives from the san francisco area were at the company 's hartford conn. headquarters for additional training on how to handle major catastrophes including earthquakes \r\n since commercial airline flights were disrupted the company chartered three planes to fly these executives back to the west coast and bring along portable computers cellular phones and some claims adjusters \r\n because of the difficulty of assessing the damages caused by the earthquake aetna pulled together a team of its most experienced claims adjusters from around the country \r\n even so few had ever dealt with an earthquake \r\n some adjusters like alan singer of san diego had been working in charleston for nearly four weeks \r\n he returned home last thursday packed a bag with fresh clothes and reported for duty friday in <unk> creek \r\n offices were set up in san francisco and san jose \r\n in a few <unk> aetna knew it would probably be <unk> out big <unk> even before a client called or <unk> in a claim \r\n for example officials at <unk> creek office learned that the <unk> hotel near the san francisco airport which is insured by aetna was badly damaged when they saw it on network television news \r\n the secret to being a good adjuster is counting says <unk> <unk> an aetna adjuster from santa ana \r\n you have to count everything \r\n adjusters must count the number of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> \r\n but they must also <unk> a price to each of these items as well as to floors <unk> <unk> and <unk> to come up with a total value for a house \r\n to do that they must think in terms of <unk> by the square foot carpeting by the square yard <unk> by the roll <unk> by the linear foot \r\n using a <unk> and a <unk> guide for such jobs as painting plumbing and <unk> in each major region of the country adjusters can figure out the value of a home in today 's market and what it would cost to rebuild it \r\n sometimes repairs are out of the question \r\n when aetna adjuster bill schaeffer visited a retired couple in oakland last thursday he found them living in a mobile home <unk> in front of their yard \r\n the house itself located about N yards from the collapsed section of <unk> highway interstate N was pushed about four feet off its foundation and then collapsed into its <unk> \r\n the next day mr. schaeffer presented the couple with a check for $ N to help them build a new home in the same neighborhood \r\n he also is working with a real-estate agent to help find them an apartment to rent while their home is being built \r\n many of the adjusters employed by aetna and other insurers have some experience with construction work or <unk> \r\n but such skills were <unk> to <unk> johnson \r\n four years ago she was managing a <unk> shop and was totally <unk> \r\n a friend mentioned that she might want to look into a position at aetna if she was interested in a job that would constantly challenge her \r\n she signed up starting as an inside adjuster who <unk> minor claims and does a lot of work by phone \r\n a year later she moved to the commercial property claims division \r\n she spent a month at an aetna school in <unk> pa. learning all about the construction trade including <unk> plumbing and electrical <unk> \r\n that was followed by three months at the aetna institute in hartford where she was <unk> in learning how to read and interpret policies \r\n her new line of work has some <unk> \r\n recently a contractor saved her from falling three stories as she investigated what remained of an old <unk> house <unk> by an <unk> \r\n i owe that contractor \r\n i really do she says \r\n as ms. johnson stands outside the hammack house after <unk> up her chores there the house begins to <unk> and <unk> \r\n the ground <unk> <unk> her \r\n it is an <unk> one of about N since the earthquake and it makes her uneasy \r\n the next day as she prepares a $ N check for the <unk> which will cover the cost of <unk> the house and clearing away the debris she <unk> at the <unk> noise \r\n on further reflection she admits that <unk> inside the <unk> ' house the previous day was n't such a great idea \r\n during her second meeting with the <unk> ms. johnson reviews exactly what their policy covers \r\n they would like to retrieve some appliances on the second floor but wonder if it 's safe to venture inside \r\n ms. johnson tells them that if the appliances ca n't be <unk> their policy covers the replacement cost \r\n mr. hammack is eager to know what aetna will pay for the house which has to come down \r\n when will i get that check for a million dollars he jokes \r\n the adjuster had n't completed all the calculations but says we 're talking policy limits \r\n in this case that 's about $ N \r\n it suddenly <unk> on mr. hammack that rebuilding the house in los <unk> an affluent community in santa clara county may cost more than aetna 's policy will pay \r\n we can lose money on this he says \r\n and you did n't want me to buy earthquake insurance says mrs. hammack reaching across the table and gently <unk> his hand \r\n earthquake insurance costs about $ N to $ N annually for every $ N of value and high <unk> mean it generally pays only when there is a catastrophe \r\n so many californians believe they can get by without it \r\n even ms. johnson herself made that assumption \r\n i always knew that the big one was coming but not during my lifetime she says \r\n now she says she 's thinking of <unk> her own insurance agent \r\n for ms. johnson dealing with the earthquake has been more than just a work experience \r\n she lives in oakland a community hit hard by the earthquake \r\n she did n't have hot water for five days \r\n the apartment she shares with a <unk> daughter and her sister was rattled books and crystal hit the floor but nothing was severely damaged \r\n her sister cynthia wishes <unk> had a different job \r\n we worry about her out there cynthia says \r\n last sunday ms. johnson finally got a chance to water her plants but stopped abruptly \r\n i realized i could n't waste this water when there are people in <unk> who do n't have fresh water to drink \r\n she has n't played any music since the earthquake hit out of respect for those who died on interstate N where the roadway collapsed \r\n the federal communications commission allowed american telephone & telegraph co. to continue offering discount phone services for <unk> customers and said it would soon <unk> its regulation of the long-distance market \r\n the fcc moves were good news for at&t which has been <unk> since the breakup of the phone system for greater <unk> in pricing and reduced regulation \r\n alfred <unk> the new fcc chairman <unk> deregulation of at&t at his last job as head of a commerce department telecommunications agency \r\n but it has been an open question whether mr. <unk> an extraordinarily cautious man would continue pushing deregulation at the fcc in the face of what is likely to be great political pressure \r\n it means that <unk> is serious about the deregulation of long distance said jack <unk> a telecommunications analyst at painewebber inc. who attended the fcc meeting \r\n all the commissioners were in amazing agreement to <unk> regulation for only having been together for a few months \r\n the fcc took three specific actions regarding at&t \r\n by a N vote it allowed at&t to continue offering special discount packages to big customers called tariff N rejecting appeals by at&t competitors that the discounts were illegal \r\n then by a separate N vote it chose the <unk> possible grounds to strike down a different discount plan called tariff N that at&t offered to holiday corp \r\n at&t gave a N N to N N discount to the memphis tenn. company that oversees holiday <unk> in response to a similar discount offered to holiday corp. by mci communications corp \r\n the agency said that because mci 's offer had expired at&t could n't continue to offer its discount plan \r\n but the agency specifically did n't rule whether at&t had the right to match offers by competitors if that means giving discounts not generally available to other phone users \r\n indeed joe <unk> at&t 's vice president for <unk> services said at&t offered a similar tariff N discount to resort <unk> international of indianapolis to meet another mci bid \r\n the fcc did n't say i could n't do it again he said \r\n apart from those two actions mr. <unk> and the three other commissioners said they expect to <unk> how at&t is regulated since competition has increased \r\n richard <unk> chief of the fcc 's <unk> bureau said he expected the agency to propose new rules next year \r\n at&t <unk> the fcc 's actions \r\n the time is long overdue to take a look at the fierce competition in the long-distance business and the rules governing it the new york telecommunications firm said in a statement \r\n but mci of washington was <unk> with the fcc decision concerning tariff N arguing that at&t can not be allowed to <unk> fcc rules \r\n united telecommunications inc. 's us <unk> unit said it was obviously disappointed with the fcc decision on tariff N \r\n us <unk> said was it will petition the fcc decision in federal court \r\n we believe that the court will find it unlawful said a us <unk> spokesman \r\n separately at&t filed a <unk> against mci <unk> it of misleading consumers through allegedly false and deceptive advertising \r\n the at&t action was the most recent blow in a nasty fight \r\n earlier this month mci sued at&t in federal district court claiming that at&t 's ads are false \r\n at&t assembled three of its top executives in washington all <unk> angry to try to <unk> mci 's charges \r\n mci has made <unk> out of the upper <unk> of at&t said painewebber 's mr. <unk> who said he expected at&t to become increasingly aggressive in dealing with its longtime <unk> \r\n <unk> <unk> <unk> in philadelphia also contributed to this article \r\n billions of investors ' dollars are pouring out of the nation 's junk-bond mutual funds <unk> a <unk> of support in the already reeling junk market \r\n last week alone an <unk> $ N billion <unk> out of the junk funds or nearly N N of their total assets according to estimates by <unk> financial services inc. a boston research firm \r\n in the past two months the nation 's N junk funds have lost a total of about $ N billion more than N N of assets through sales or transfers of <unk> shares <unk> says \r\n it made the estimates based on data collected from more than a dozen big junk funds \r\n interviews with three major fund groups fidelity investments vanguard group inc. and t. rowe price associates inc. confirm the trend \r\n their junk funds combined have had net outflows totaling nearly $ N million or about N N of their junk fund assets in the past two months \r\n some fund managers say negative publicity has <unk> investors ' concern about recent declines in junk-bond prices \r\n people have been seeing headline after headline after headline and saying i ca n't take it anymore i 'm getting out says kurt brouwer of brouwer & <unk> a san francisco investment adviser \r\n the withdrawals could <unk> trouble for the $ N billion junk market \r\n if the heavy outflows continue fund managers will face increasing pressure to sell off some of their junk to pay <unk> investors in the weeks ahead \r\n such selling could erode prices of high-yield junk bonds already weakened by a rash of corporate credit problems \r\n mutual fund groups have n't lost control of much of the <unk> money says louis <unk> <unk> 's president \r\n mutual fund officials say that investors have transferred most of it into their money market accounts and to a lesser extent <unk> funds \r\n so the impact on the $ N billion mutual fund industry as a whole probably will be slight \r\n but tremors are likely in the junk-bond market which has helped to finance the takeover boom of recent years \r\n mutual funds are the among the largest holders of junk accounting for more than a quarter of the entire high-yield high-risk market \r\n the N mutual funds investing solely in junk bonds hold assets of about $ N billion \r\n other funds hold a <unk> of junk bonds too \r\n the $ N billion fidelity high income fund has had a net <unk> of about $ N million in the past two months \r\n about $ N million <unk> out last week alone double the level of the week following last month 's campeau corp. credit squeeze \r\n about N N of the <unk> was transferred to other fidelity funds says neal <unk> a fidelity vice president marketing with most going into money market funds \r\n you get a news item it hits you have strong redemptions that day and for two days following then go back to normal says mr. <unk> \r\n the fund with a cash cushion of more than N N has met all the redemptions without having to sell one thing mr. <unk> says \r\n he adds our fund has had positive net sales every month for the last three years until this month \r\n vanguard 's $ N billion high yield bond portfolio has seen $ N million flow out since early september $ N million of that <unk> out friday oct. N alone \r\n still two-thirds of the <unk> has been <unk> into other vanguard portfolios says brian <unk> a vice president \r\n the fund now holds a cash position of about N N \r\n at the $ N million t. rowe price high yield fund investors <unk> out about $ N million in the past two months \r\n those withdrawals most of which were transferred to other t. rowe price funds followed little change in the fund 's sales picture this year through august \r\n the last two months have been the whole ball game says steven <unk> a vice president \r\n <unk> holders have barely broken even this year as fat interest payments barely managed to offset declining prices \r\n through oct. N high-yield funds had an average N N total return the price change plus dividends on fund shares according to lipper analytical services inc \r\n that 's even less than the N N total return of the merrill lynch high-yield index \r\n fidelity 's junk fund has fallen N N this year through oct. N lipper says the vanguard fund rose N N and the t. rowe price fund edged up N N \r\n people who remain in junk funds now could get hit again some analysts and fund specialists say \r\n many funds in recent weeks and months have been selling their <unk> junk issues such as rjr nabisco to raise cash to meet expected redemptions \r\n funds might be forced to accept lower prices if they expand their selling to the securities of <unk> borrowers \r\n and then asset values of the funds could plunge more than they have so far \r\n says michael <unk> chief investment officer of republic national bank and manager of the <unk> group in new york it 's a time bomb just waiting to go off \r\n the surprise resignation yesterday of british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson sent sterling into a tailspin against the dollar by creating uncertainties about the direction of the british economy \r\n the u.s. unit also firmed against other currencies on the back of sterling 's tumble as market participants switched out of pounds \r\n the pound also dropped <unk> against the mark falling below the key <unk> level to N marks from N marks late wednesday \r\n mr. lawson 's resignation shocked many analysts despite the recent <unk> speculation of a <unk> between the chancellor and prime minister margaret thatcher \r\n indeed only hours earlier mrs. thatcher had called mr. lawson 's economic policies sound and said she has always supported him \r\n there was a general feeling that we 'd seen the worst said patrick foley deputy chief economic adviser for <unk> bank in london \r\n the resignation came as a great surprise \r\n graham <unk> manager of foreign-exchange operations at hong kong & shanghai banking corp. in new york added that mrs. thatcher 's comments reinforced the market 's growing confidence about sterling and compounded the unit 's later decline \r\n the market was caught totally the wrong way \r\n everyone was extremely long on sterling mr. <unk> said \r\n in late new york trading yesterday the dollar was quoted at N marks up from N marks late wednesday and at N yen up from N yen late wednesday \r\n sterling was quoted at $ N sharply down from $ N late wednesday \r\n in tokyo friday the u.s. currency opened for trading at N yen up from thursday 's tokyo close of N yen \r\n few analysts had much good to say about the pound 's near-term prospects despite the fact that most do n't anticipate a shift in mrs. thatcher 's economic policies \r\n mr. foley of <unk> noted that mr. lawson 's replacement john major the british foreign minister will take time to establish his credibility and in the meantime sterling could trend downward in volatile trade \r\n but mr. foley predicted few economic policy changes ahead commenting that mr. major shares a very similar view of the world with mr. lawson \r\n bob <unk> chief economist at <unk> bank in new york also noted that the pound 's sharp decline is pegged more to uncertainty in the market than a vision of altered united kingdom economic policies \r\n unless mr. lawson 's resignation leads to a change in british interest-rate policy mrs. thatcher 's administration firmly supports high interest rates to keep inflation in check or <unk> toward full <unk> in the european monetary system 's exchange-rate mechanism mr. lawson 's withdrawal will have little long-term impact on exchange rates mr. <unk> concluded \r\n also announcing his resignation thursday was alan walters mrs. thatcher 's economic adviser and mr. lawson 's <unk> \r\n the pound which had been trading at about $ N in new york prior to mr. lawson 's announcement sank more than two cents to $ N prompting the federal reserve bank to buy pounds for dollars \r\n the fed 's move however only proved a <unk> to the pound 's slide and the fed intervened for a second time at around $ N according to new york traders \r\n meanwhile dollar trading was relatively <unk> throughout the session according to dealers who noted that thursday 's release of the preliminary report on the u.s. third-quarter gross national product was something of a <unk> \r\n u.s. gnp rose at an annual rate of N N in the third quarter \r\n the implicit price deflator a measure of inflation was down to a N N annual rate of increase in the quarter from a N N rate of gain in the second quarter \r\n in europe the dollar ended lower in <unk>

senate intelligence committee hangs a quote from chairman david boren do n't hold your ticket <unk> the show 's over \r\n he once used that line in a <unk> meeting on panama meaning do n't shrink from taking action against manuel noriega \r\n so how did a good senator like this end up <unk> a policy that required the u.s. to warn mr. noriega of any coup plot against him \r\n i agree it 's ridiculous says mr. boren and indeed by now ridiculous may be the only way to describe how the u.s. decides to take or rather not to take covert action \r\n george bush disclosed the policy last week by reading it to gop senators perhaps as a way of shifting blame for the panama <unk> to congress \r\n but the broader truth is more complicated and <unk> \r\n the policy was contained in an exchange of letters last october between the senate intelligence committee and the cia and national security council \r\n staff lawyers for both sides were busy agreeing with one another about what the u.s. could not do to oust the panamanian <unk> \r\n they simply got carried away with <unk> what the executive order banning assassinations really meant \r\n mr. boren himself did n't discover the <unk> <unk> until mr. bush told him privately at the white house last week \r\n it 's ironic that david boren should be in the center of this <unk> \r\n a former oklahoma governor he 's a <unk> <unk> of presidential powers in foreign policy \r\n he 's a rare democratic <unk> \r\n he 's the senator most like arthur <unk> the gop senator from michigan who worked to forge a bipartisan foreign policy in the <unk> \r\n <unk> and <unk> are heroes of mine mr. boren says referring as well to sam <unk> the democratic house speaker who <unk> with president <unk> \r\n they allowed this country to be credible \r\n i really want to see that happen again \r\n if this were N mr. boren might even succeed \r\n but in N most senators have other ideas \r\n last july his committee rejected a reagan administration plan to support a coup in panama \r\n ohio democrat howard <unk> refused to support any plan that might get people hurt a <unk> notion for a great power \r\n maine republican william cohen said the plan might violate the assassination ban \r\n so the administration dropped it \r\n by october when the committee rejected a much more modest covert proposal even the administration was agreeing little should be done \r\n mr. boren does n't think all this influenced the failed coup this month but he does concede that congress has made mistakes \r\n in the aftermath of vietnam in the aftermath of iran-contra i can understand some people might think that if they plan a coup they have to bring their lawyers he says \r\n but even mr. boren <unk> congressional oversight \r\n writing in the harvard international review he says that his committee approves covert operations only when there 's a consensus \r\n so what does consensus mean \r\n it does n't mean <unk> he insists though he implies it means a bipartisan majority \r\n the <unk> of u.s. foreign policy is essential he explains \r\n why was <unk> so successful \r\n because it had bipartisan support \r\n mr. boren is confusing consensus on general principles with agreement on specific actions \r\n elliott abrams a veteran of intelligence committee debates doubts that even <unk> or the <unk> <unk> would have taken place if consensus had been required \r\n <unk> and <unk> were <unk> enough to leave specific operations to presidents modern senators mr. boren notwithstanding are less modest \r\n the result is that the senate committee has what amounts to veto power over every covert action \r\n i would n't say it 's quite a veto mr. boren <unk> \r\n but would n't a president who acted despite senate objections be taking grave political risks \r\n he would agrees the chairman \r\n but that is something the president ought to know before he goes ahead \r\n mr. boren even <unk> a silver <unk> \r\n he figures the episode will help clarify any <unk> between the committee and administration \r\n he points to a letter on his desk his second in a week from president bush saying that they do n't disagree \r\n more broadly mr. boren hopes that panama will shock washington out of its fear of using military power \r\n maybe this will jolt us out of the <unk> syndrome that we never are prepared to use force he says \r\n maybe if every senator shared the principles of mr. boren \r\n but it 's just as <unk> to argue that if even david boren can get mired in this sort of mess the problem goes beyond legal interpretation \r\n maybe the problem is a political system that wo n't act without an exchange of letters that insists on running foreign policy by committee that <unk> a president as just another guy at the table \r\n the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> is that we ca n't abolish these oversight committees because we 've seen too many abuses of executive power \r\n but panama illustrates that their substitute is a system that produces an absurd gridlock \r\n the lawyers are now in charge of our national security \r\n in panama the u.s. interests at stake were <unk> minor the only people killed were foreigners <unk> enough to trust american will \r\n americans may not be so lucky the next time \r\n i was impressed by the <unk> of your sept. N story rural enterprise tough row to <unk> \r\n we lived in rural areas many years but now live in st. louis county <unk> \r\n this morning as i drove the N miles to my law office and <unk> the routine heavy traffic during that <unk> <unk> i thought of how <unk> it was that we made the decision to be residents of an expanding community with so many opportunities and where so much is happening \r\n the presence of so many people cars and competing businesses is evidence of a healthy economy in a place where people want to live \r\n i thought back to our time in small <unk> <unk>

projects \r\n yet when my youngest child died two years ago i buried him in the church cemetery of a small missouri town \r\n so after all even the <unk> critic of rural exclusivity harbors a

of waertsilae marine oy a major shipyard that filed for bankruptcy protection this week amid confusion and mounting doubts that collapse of the nation 's entire shipbuilding industry can be <unk> \r\n at stake are almost N jobs in an industry that has been the mainstay of finland 's <unk> economic revival \r\n shipbuilding became a point of pride as finnish <unk> remained profitable long after rivals collapsed all over europe \r\n but if as many now fear waertsilae marine joins the ranks of failed <unk> it might turn out to be remembered most as a <unk> on finland 's international reputation \r\n the shipyard 's N billion finnish <unk> $ N billion backlog includes about N ships ordered by big international shippers including three for carnival cruise lines inc \r\n miami-based carnival said the first of the three ships is scheduled to be delivered next month just in time for the winter tourist season in the caribbean \r\n the second ship is scheduled to be delivered in fall N and the third in fall N \r\n one analyst said the first ship probably will be delivered close to schedule but that carnival may have to pay up to N N more to get the second and third ships \r\n all the ships are covered by loan guarantees from a state export financing agency even though it 's not clear whether they will actually be built \r\n bankers worry that if the government makes good a threat to withdraw its guarantee commitments shippers will counter with a <unk> of lawsuits \r\n state loan guarantees are rarely a source of controversy \r\n however some bankers cited possible parallels between the waertsilae marine case and the collapse of norway 's state-owned <unk> <unk> as two years ago \r\n in that case international banks and investors incurred big losses because they incorrectly believed the company 's debt carried implicit state guarantees \r\n doubts about the quality of state credit guarantees could reduce the competitive strength of finnish companies in world markets where financing often is the key to winning orders analysts warn \r\n moreover state-owned finnish companies lacking formal state guarantees could face greater difficulty raising funds in international financial markets bankers say \r\n the decision by a majority of <unk> waertsilae marine directors monday to file for bankruptcy was an abrupt <unk> from previous government policy \r\n in august the government played a major part in a sweeping restructuring of the troubled shipyard \r\n at the time <unk> by oy waertsilae a conglomerate the shipbuilding unit faced potential losses estimated at one billion <unk> and was on the brink of liquidation \r\n under the rescue plan waertsilae sold N N of its stake to a group of banks and pension funds \r\n the government in turn guaranteed financing to complete the order backlog and took control of the board \r\n government officials were expected to combine waertsilae marine with two other struggling firms and thus ensure finland 's survival as a shipbuilding nation \r\n the government spent most of last year attempting to carry out such a plan but was <unk> when the parent waertsilae concern pulled out at the last minute \r\n after the restructuring of waertsilae marine and bolstered by state loan guarantees two big bank creditors union bank of finland and state-controlled <unk> resumed lending the shipyard working capital \r\n but the bankers got cold feet recently as government officials complained they had been <unk> about the shipyard 's actual financial condition and hinted the credit guarantees might be withdrawn \r\n people familiar with monday 's board meeting said it was the state 's refusal to <unk> <unk> the credit guarantees that led union bank and <unk> to halt lending to waertsilae marine \r\n then in a <unk> <unk> <unk> directors voted to file for bankruptcy apparently under instructions from finland 's industry minister <unk> <unk> \r\n analysts say mr. <unk> had grown increasingly worried about the state 's potential financial exposure as waertsilae marine 's losses <unk> to more than double the figure estimated in august \r\n noting that sweden wound up <unk> state subsidies of about N billion swedish kronor $ N billion during the 1970s in a <unk> attempt to salvage its shipbuilding industry one analyst suggested that mr. <unk> may have decided to cut finland 's losses once and for all \r\n senior ministry officials <unk> with creditors during the week in an attempt to agree on some form of restructuring that would keep waertsilae marine operating \r\n the talks may drag on for weeks before any concrete result is announced people familiar with them said \r\n one solution would be to sell the shipyard to an outsider \r\n but there appear to be few if any suitors \r\n indeed the potential losses make any rescue scheme unlikely unless the politicians once again change <unk> and agree to pick up the bill analysts said \r\n meantime shippers with vessels on order from waertsilae marine will remain in limbo \r\n turner broadcasting system inc. said it expects to report an extraordinary loss of about $ N million in the fourth quarter due to early retirement of debt \r\n the cable <unk> said the loss will consist primarily of prepayment penalties and <unk> issue discount and costs related to its <unk> $ N billion refinancing of its long-term debt and some preferred stock in one of its subsidiaries \r\n a turner spokesman would n't speculate on the extent of the charge 's effect on the quarter 's earnings but said the company continues to expect to report a net loss for N \r\n the company said the repayment or redemption of the long-term debt and the outstanding class a cumulative <unk> preferred stock of cable news network was made possible by an offering of about $ N million of debentures and notes and $ N million in bank borrowings \r\n the offering included $ N million of N N senior subordinated debentures

friday qintex entertainment inc. its <unk> u.s. tv production and distribution affiliate filed for chapter N protection \r\n the government is <unk> its newest weapon against white-collar defendants the power to prevent them from paying their legal bills \r\n and defense lawyers are warning that they wo n't stick around if they do n't get paid \r\n the issue has come to a <unk> in newark n.j. where federal prosecutors have warned lawyers for eddie antar that if the founder and former chairman of crazy eddie inc. is indicted the government may move to seize the money that mr. antar is using to pay legal fees \r\n the warning by the u.s. attorney 's office follows two decisions by the u.s. supreme court last june \r\n in those cases the high court ruled that federal law gives prosecutors broad authority to seize assets of people accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes including fees paid to lawyers before an indictment \r\n if the government succeeds in <unk> mr. antar 's assets he could be left without <unk> legal representation because his attorneys are likely to quit according to individuals familiar with the case \r\n a seizure also would make the case the largest and one of the first in which lawyers ' fees have been confiscated in a prosecution unrelated to drugs \r\n the people who suffer in the short run are defendants but the people who suffer in the long run are all of the people because there wo n't be a vigorous private bar to defend the bill of rights says gerald <unk> a criminal defense attorney who says he has turned down a number of cases to avoid possible fee seizures \r\n mr. antar is being investigated by a federal grand jury in newark where prosecutors have told him that they may soon seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges \r\n under the <unk> influenced and corrupt organizations law or rico the government has the authority to seek to freeze or seize a defendant 's assets before trial \r\n according to individuals familiar with mr. antar 's case prosecutors issued their warning this week after one of mr. antar 's attorneys asked whether legal fees might be subject to seizure \r\n in a letter prosecutors told mr. antar 's lawyers that because of the recent supreme court rulings they could expect that any fees collected from mr. antar may be seized \r\n prosecutors have told mr. antar 's attorneys that they believe mr. antar 's allegedly <unk> gains are so great that any money he has used to pay attorneys <unk> from illegal activities \r\n therefore they said the money can be taken from the lawyers even after they are paid \r\n justin <unk> and jack <unk> attorneys for mr. antar both declined to comment on the matter \r\n in newark u.s. attorney samuel a. <unk> said i do n't think there 's any legal reason to limit forfeiture of attorney 's fees to drug cases \r\n mr. <unk> said his office just responded to an attorney 's question about whether we would go after attorney 's fees and that is different from actually doing it although we reserve that right \r\n mr. antar was charged last month in a civil suit filed in federal court in newark by the securities and exchange commission \r\n in that suit the sec accused mr. antar of engaging in a massive financial fraud to <unk> the earnings of crazy eddie edison n.j. over a three-year period \r\n through his lawyers mr. antar has denied allegations in the sec suit and in civil suits previously filed by shareholders against mr. antar and others \r\n the sec has alleged that mr. antar aimed to pump up the company 's stock price through false financial statements in order to sell his stake and reap huge profits \r\n mr. antar the sec said made more than $ N million from the sale of his shares between N and N \r\n the justice department has emphasized that the government 's <unk> power is to be used <unk> \r\n according to department policy prosecutors must make a strong showing that lawyers ' fees came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts at seizure are made \r\n still criminal defense lawyers worry that defendants are being deprived of their sixth amendment right to counsel and a fair trial if the government can seize lawyers ' fees \r\n they also worry that if the government applies <unk> laws broadly the best defense lawyers will be unwilling to take criminal cases unless they are assured of being paid \r\n the stock market correction of oct. N N was a grim reminder of the oct. N N market collapse \r\n since like earthquakes stock market <unk> will always be with us it is prudent to take all possible <unk> against another such market collapse \r\n in general markets function well and adjust smoothly to changing economic and financial circumstances \r\n but there are times when they seize up and <unk> sellers can not find buyers \r\n that 's just what happened in the october N crash \r\n as the market tumbled <unk> market conditions prevailed the margins between buying bids and selling bids widened trading in many stocks was suspended orders took <unk> long to be executed and many specialists stopped trading altogether \r\n these failures in turn contributed to the fall in the market averages uncertainty <unk> an extra risk premium and <unk> triggered additional selling pressures \r\n the situation was like that of a <unk> who is thrown slightly off balance by an unexpected <unk> on the <unk> \r\n his <unk> spread <unk> and <unk> apart just as <unk> spreads widen during a financial panic and soon he is out of control \r\n unable to stop his accelerating <unk> he crashes \r\n after the N crash and as a result of the recommendations of many studies circuit breakers were devised to allow market participants to <unk> and restore orderly market conditions \r\n it 's doubtful though whether circuit breakers do any real good \r\n in the additional time they provide even more order imbalances might pile up as would-be sellers finally get their broker on the phone \r\n instead an appropriate institution should be charged with the job of preventing chaos in the market the federal reserve \r\n the availability of timely assistance of a <unk> can help markets retain their resilience \r\n the fed already buys and sells foreign exchange to prevent <unk> conditions in foreign-exchange markets \r\n the fed has assumed a similar responsibility in the market for government securities \r\n the stock market is the only major market without a <unk> of <unk> liquidity or a buyer of last resort \r\n this does not mean that the federal reserve does not already play an important indirect role in the stock market \r\n in N it pumped billions into the markets through open market operations and the discount window \r\n it lent money to banks and encouraged them to make funds available to brokerage houses \r\n they in turn lent money to their customers who were supposed to recognize the opportunity to make a profit in the turmoil and buy shares \r\n the fed also has the power to set margin requirements \r\n but would n't it be more efficient and effective to supply such support to the stock market directly \r\n instead of flooding the entire economy with liquidity and thereby increasing the danger of inflation the fed could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the futures market thus stabilizing the market as a whole \r\n the stock market is certainly not too big for the fed to handle \r\n the foreign-exchange and government securities markets are <unk> larger \r\n daily trading volume in the new york foreign exchange market is $ N billion \r\n the daily volume for treasury securities is about $ N billion \r\n the combined value of daily equity trading on the new york exchange the american stock exchange and the nasdaq over-the-counter market ranges between $ N billion and $ N billion \r\n the $ N billion the fed <unk> into the money markets after the N crash is more than enough to buy all the stocks traded on a typical day \r\n more carefully targeted intervention might actually reduce the need for government action \r\n and taking more direct action has the advantage of avoiding sharp increases in the money supply such as happened in october N \r\n the fed 's stock market role ought not to be very ambitious \r\n it should seek only to maintain the <unk> of markets not to <unk> up the dow jones or new york stock exchange averages at a particular level \r\n the fed should guard against <unk> risk but not against the risks inherent in individual stocks \r\n it would be inappropriate for the government or the central bank to buy or sell ibm or general motors shares \r\n instead the fed could buy the broad market <unk> in the futures market \r\n the increased demand would <unk> trading and stabilize prices \r\n stabilizing the derivative markets would tend to stabilize the primary market \r\n the fed would eliminate the cause of the potential panic rather than attempting to treat the <unk> the liquidity of the banks \r\n <unk> market conditions could be observed quite frequently in foreign exchange markets in the 1960s and 1970s \r\n but since the member countries of the international monetary fund agreed to the guidelines to floating in N such difficulties have been avoided \r\n i can not recall any <unk> in currency markets since the N guidelines were adopted \r\n thus the mere existence of a <unk> agency helps to avoid panic in <unk> \r\n the old saying advises if it ai n't broke do n't fix it \r\n but this could be a case where we all might go broke if it is n't fixed \r\n mr. heller now at visa international was a governor of the federal reserve board from N until earlier this year \r\n this is adapted from a speech to the commonwealth club in san francisco \r\n bank of england governor robin <unk> urged banks to be cautious in financing leveraged buy-outs \r\n caution should be the rule of the day said mr. <unk> in a speech to the association of corporate <unk> ' annual dinner \r\n it would be damaging to industry and to the financial sector in general to say nothing of banks if <unk> does not guide the financing of leveraged transactions \r\n his remarks were distributed to the press before chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson announced his resignation last evening \r\n bank of england officials said the central bank had no comment on mr. lawson 's resignation \r\n mr. <unk> reiterated that the exposure of united kingdom banks to leveraged deals have n't yet reached worrying levels \r\n however in light of the risks involved in such transactions banks should satisfy themselves that they have the skills to participate in this market and clear policy guidelines on acceptable levels of exposure to such transactions he said \r\n in other comments he said takeovers may not always be the most efficient way of <unk> a change of corporate direction or strategy \r\n a similar result could sometimes be achieved at less cost by changing <unk> he said \r\n intel corp. 's most powerful computer chip has flaws that could delay several computer makers ' marketing efforts but the bugs are n't expected to hurt intel and most computer makers \r\n computer experts familiar with the flaws found in intel 's N chip say the defects do n't affect the average user and are likely to be cleared up before most computers using the chip as their brains appear on the market sometime next year \r\n intel said that last week a customer discovered two flaws in its N microprocessor chip 's <unk> unit a set of circuits that do certain calculations \r\n on friday intel began <unk> customers about the bugs which cause the chip to give wrong answers for some <unk> calculations \r\n but while international business machines corp. and compaq computer corp. say the bugs will delay products most big computer makers said the flaws do n't affect them \r\n bugs like this are just a normal part of product development said richard <unk> director of hewlett-packard co. 's advanced systems development \r\n <unk> announced last week that it planned to ship a computer based on the N chip early next year \r\n these bugs do n't affect our schedule at all he said \r\n likewise <unk> research inc. and sun microsystems inc. said the bugs wo n't delay their development of <unk> machines \r\n we have n't modified our schedules in any way said a sun spokesman \r\n to switch to another vendor 's chips would definitely not be an option he said \r\n nonetheless concern about the chip may have been responsible for a decline of N cents in intel 's stock to $ N a share yesterday in over-the-counter trading on volume of N shares and partly responsible for a drop in compaq 's stock in new york stock exchange composite trading on wednesday \r\n yesterday compaq plunged further closing at $ N a share off $ N a share on volume of N shares \r\n most of compaq 's decline is being attributed to a third-quarter earnings report that came in at the low end of analysts ' expectations \r\n intel said it had corrected the problems and would start producing <unk> chips next week \r\n we should not be seeing any more said bill rash intel 's director for the N chip \r\n what 's more the bugs only emerge on <unk> applications such as <unk> design and scientific calculations he said and then very seldom \r\n these <unk> do not affect business programs he said \r\n the bugs will cause problems in specific and rare circumstances that will not occur in typical applications such as <unk> and <unk> said michael <unk> editor of the microprocessor report an industry newsletter \r\n sun hewlett-packard and others say intel is n't wholly to blame for the <unk> \r\n the real <unk> they said are computer makers such as ibm that have jumped the gun to unveil <unk> products \r\n the reason this is getting so much <unk> is that some started shipping and announced early availability said hewlett-packard 's mr. <unk> \r\n you can do that but you 're taking a risk \r\n those companies are paying the price for taking the risk \r\n in late september ibm began shipping a <unk> card that <unk> its <unk> model <unk> from a N machine to an N machine \r\n an ibm spokeswoman said the company told customers monday about the bugs and temporarily stopped shipping the product \r\n ibm has no plans to recall its <unk> cards the spokeswoman said and could probably <unk> the bugs without long product delays \r\n we do n't look at this as a major problem for us she said \r\n compaq which said it discovered the bugs still plans to announce new N products on nov. N \r\n because of the <unk> however the company said it does n't know when its machine will be <unk> available \r\n that 's a break from compaq tradition because the company does n't announce products until they 're actually at the dealers \r\n the problem is being <unk> experts say because the N is intel 's future flagship \r\n intel 's microprocessors are the chips of choice in many of today 's personal computers and the N microprocessor is the <unk> of the company 's bid to guard that spot in the next generation of machines \r\n although these sorts of bugs are not at all uncommon the N is an extremely <unk> product said mr. <unk> the newsletter editor \r\n intel 's N chip is the <unk> of intel 's microprocessors a <unk> <unk> chip that only the most <unk> computer users are likely to buy for at least several years \r\n unveiled last april the chip <unk> N million <unk> on a <unk> of silicon more than four times as many as on intel 's earlier model N \r\n intel <unk> the chip 's speed at N million instructions per second or mips \r\n that 's four times as fast as the N \r\n machines using the N are expected to challenge <unk> work stations and minicomputers in applications such as so-called <unk> which <unk> groups of computers together and in <unk> design \r\n but while the chip 's speed in processing power is <unk> it 's real strength lies in its software <unk> \r\n the N is the <unk> of a long series of intel chips that began <unk> the market ever since ibm picked the <unk> N chip for its first personal computer \r\n a <unk> microprocessor processes N pieces of data at a time and is slower than newer <unk> chips \r\n since then intel has <unk> a large part of the market with <unk> generations of <unk> and <unk> chips all of which can run software written for previous models \r\n that 's what will keep computer makers coming in spite of the <unk> of bugs \r\n big personal computer makers and many makers of engineering workstations are developing <unk> machines which are expected to reach the market early next year \r\n of the big computer makers only apple computer co. bases its machines on motorola chips instead \r\n the N is going to have a big impact on the industry said hewlett-packard 's mr. <unk> \r\n it 's going to be the leading edge technology in personal computers for the next few years \r\n this <unk> is not going to have any affect on that at all \r\n andy <unk> in dallas contributed to this article \r\n bethlehem steel corp. has agreed in principle to form a joint venture with the world 's second-largest steelmaker <unk> of france to modernize a portion of bethlehem 's ailing <unk> division \r\n the venture which involves adding sophisticated equipment to make <unk> mill rolls is part of a <unk> effort to shore up a division that has posted continuing operating losses for several years \r\n the other element includes consolidating <unk> 's <unk> operations \r\n the entire division employs about N workers \r\n while the joint venture affects only a small part of bethlehem 's operations it is significant because it marks the first time the nation 's no. N steelmaker has joined forces with a foreign partner \r\n wall street analysts have criticized bethlehem for not following its major competitors in linking with a foreign company to share costs and provide technology to modernize old facilities or build new ones \r\n we think it 's a step in the right direction for bethlehem said <unk> <unk> <unk> group 's international steel analyst \r\n it 's important to share the risk and even more so when the market has already peaked \r\n he said the move could be the beginning of a broader relationship between the two companies one that could open up new markets for bethlehem \r\n bethlehem had little choice but to go with a european steelmaker because its competitors already have tapped the japanese and south korean industry leaders analysts noted \r\n under terms of the agreement <unk> 's <unk> unit and bethlehem would establish a <unk> facility to make <unk> mill rolls at the company 's <unk> shop here \r\n terms for the venture which would be jointly owned by both companies were n't disclosed \r\n the <unk> unit has agreed to provide technology and expertise to install a so-called spin <unk> by early next fall \r\n the <unk> improves the <unk> quality of the iron mill rolls which are basically huge rolling <unk> used to <unk> or shape steel products \r\n bethlehem is also working with the united steelworkers union to consolidate <unk> 's two machine shops and four <unk> facilities of the <unk> operations \r\n once the consolidation is complete bethlehem plans to concentrate its <unk> business on nuclear fabrication <unk> steel and <unk> steel rolls for rolling mills and selected <unk> applications \r\n bethlehem said earlier this year that it planned to restructure the <unk> division to improve its cost structure \r\n in the second quarter bethlehem posted a $ N million charge related to its plans to <unk> the division \r\n if you 're still wondering about the causes of the slump in the junk-bond market consider the case of columbia savings & loan \r\n the california thrift has just announced a $ N million third-quarter loss \r\n how did this happen \r\n well when congress in its recent s&l bailout mandated that the thrifts sell off all their junk-bond holdings by N it not only artificially increased the supply of these bonds in the market but also eliminated one of the few profitable investments thrifts have made \r\n but there is a <unk> ironic twist to the columbia loss \r\n as <unk> of the debate over a capital-gains tax cut know there is much talk in congress and indeed all over washington about the need to encourage long-term investment and discourage the financial sector 's presumed <unk> with the short term \r\n now we regard this as a largely phony issue but the long term is nonetheless a big salon topic all around the <unk> \r\n it turns out that columbia had this huge loss in large part because the new <unk> mandated rules forced it to adjust the book value of its <unk> junk bonds to the lower of either their cost or market value \r\n they could no longer be classified as what columbia regarded them namely long-term investments \r\n congress 's <unk> treatment of the existing structure of junk-bond holdings <unk> us of a story in the journal earlier this year about the baby bell companies ' desire to have the <unk> bans lifted on offering information services \r\n the issue of seeking relief from congress was raised to <unk> <unk> the chairman of nynex \r\n mr. <unk> replied legislation tends to be <unk> \r\n i believe we have to take a shot at getting as much done as we can through the court through justice and through state and federal regulatory agencies \r\n i see congress as a last resort \r\n healthy thrifts such as columbia or the junk-bond market itself should have been so lucky \r\n the reality of life in modern america is that if you want to <unk> something that works let it fall into the hands of congress \r\n exxon corp. said it will move its headquarters from manhattan to dallas \r\n most of the N employees at the oil company 's <unk> headquarters building including much of senior management were <unk> of the plan until informed at a morning meeting by chairman lawrence g. <unk> \r\n the shift wo n't affect operations \r\n as part of its restructuring several years ago exxon moved most of those out of the city and sold its <unk> rockefeller center <unk> to a japanese company \r\n but the pullout is an embarrassment to new york city officials coming at a time of high office building vacancy rates and departures by other major companies \r\n mobil corp. is in the process of <unk> its headquarters here and huge operations like j.c. penney & co. and trans world airlines have recently left \r\n new york authorities informed yesterday about the move reacted with concern and even some anger to the idea of the nation 's third-largest corporation leaving without giving them an opportunity to accommodate it \r\n we are <unk> but there 's nothing we can do about it now said stanley <unk> new york city deputy mayor for finance and economic development \r\n meanwhile dallas welcomed the move \r\n city officials there had been were aware that a large company was moving in but negotiations had all been conducted through a law firm and under the code name <unk> \r\n when we were told it was exxon it was beyond all expectations what a coup said tom lewis senior vice president of dallas partnership the economic development affiliate of the city 's chamber of commerce \r\n dallas its economy based on oil and real estate has been in a slump \r\n exxon said it will build a new headquarters on a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> las <unk> complex in the suburb of irving \r\n until the building is completed exxon will rent part of an existing office tower \r\n las <unk> once a huge texas ranch is a <unk> complex of office buildings homes and recreational facilities that its developers have been struggling to <unk> in recent years \r\n exxon officials said it will cost less to run its headquarters at las <unk> than in new york \r\n the company wo n't say how much it will save but during at its interim location sources say it will likely pay rent of $ N to $ N per square foot \r\n owners of the building in new york say they will be asking $ N per square foot for rent to fill the space that exxon is <unk> \r\n in texas taxes and development costs are also lower they said \r\n plus one exxon official said by eliminating the typically long new york <unk> between office and home management will expect employees to work N hours a week in dallas rather than a <unk> work week in new york \r\n canadian production of market pulp rose N N in september from a year earlier as the industry operated at N N of capacity \r\n the canadian pulp and paper association an industry group said canadian mills produced N metric tons of market pulp in september compared with

and <unk> n. klein along with five other ima <unk> were named to join american medical 's <unk> board \r\n the completion of the merger agreement follows months of <unk> and turns \r\n in january american medical brought in a new chief executive officer richard a. <unk> N who will remain as chairman president and chief executive \r\n a few days later american medical announced sharply lower earnings taking charges of $ N million for insurance reserves and canceled real estate leases \r\n in march american medical received a $ <unk> offer to take the company private from an investor group including large holder m. lee pearce \r\n it also was considering a restructuring to help boost the stock price \r\n a group including several members of the the bass family of texas urged the company to take some steps to maximize shareholder value \r\n the following month the company put itself up for sale \r\n it received more offers but the auction was surprisingly won by ima which bid $ N a share and asked mr. <unk> to stay on as an equity participant \r\n he indicated that some assets might be sold off to service the debt \r\n then after extending its offer four times waiting for a congressional tax ruling ima early this month lowered its offer to $ N a share amid turbulence in the junk bond market \r\n american medical accepted the offer meanwhile indicating it had heard from two other suitors \r\n but they never materialized and ima completed the purchase yesterday \r\n other new board members include john s. harrison and mark a. <unk> of first boston james f. <unk> william s. goldberg and harold s. <unk> \r\n treasury secretary nicholas brady said that congress should grant the securities and exchange commission the power to close the stock markets in periods of crisis \r\n in testimony to the senate securities subcommittee mr. brady disputed the view of sec chairman richard breeden who told a house panel wednesday that he does n't want the ability to halt the markets \r\n mr. breeden contended that discretionary power could have an impact on the markets if rumors were to <unk> about when the exchanges might be closed \r\n he added that the president already has the power to close the markets in an emergency \r\n but mr. brady argued that the sec is closer to the markets and in a better position to understand when the exchanges are under such stress that they should be closed \r\n separately mr. brady said he asked the working group on financial markets to determine whether futures margins are too low \r\n he noted that some minimum margin requirements have been reduced to levels below those before the N crash \r\n this raises questions whether futures and equity margin requirements are consistent at these levels and whether futures margins are adequate mr. brady said \r\n margins are the amount of money an investor needs to put up to buy or sell a futures contract \r\n margins on the futures exchanges typically are raised and lowered according to market volatility \r\n the chicago mercantile exchange margins for the standard & poor 's N stock-index futures stood at $ N a contract for speculators and $ N for <unk> before oct. N N that day the hedging margin was raised to $ N \r\n margins were raised or lowered about a dozen times since the crash oct. N N \r\n currently they stand at $ N for speculators who are typically individuals and <unk> traders and $ N for <unk> which are usually institutions and have offsetting positions in the underlying stocks \r\n mr. brady also said he expects the leveraged buy-out phenomenon to end under its own weight \r\n asked whether there is anything congress should do to curb the lbo boom mr. brady responded i think the lbo phenomenon while it wo n't stop completely will be a thing of the past \r\n before taking any action he advised the panel to see what the market has produced as a cure \r\n mr. brady also agreed with senators ' concerns about recent stock-market volatility and said he <unk> that the gyrations are scaring investors from investing in stocks \r\n but he added that individuals still are participating in the equity market indirectly through mutual funds and pension funds \r\n the former wall street executive refused to offer an opinion on the controversy surrounding program trading which has recently become a larger part of the trading in the market and has been blamed for accelerating the drop two weeks ago \r\n i do not have a view of whether we should do anything about program trading at this time he said \r\n but mr. brady endorsed the <unk> bill that both houses of congress will try to push through this session \r\n that bill proposed by the sec last year would require brokerage firms to disclose the financial positions of their holding companies mandate large traders ' reporting of program or block trades and improve clearing and settlement of trades between the futures and stock markets \r\n the bill also would give the sec the power to close the markets a discretion that former sec chairman david <unk> wanted but mr. breeden does n't \r\n mr. brady and senators agreed to have their staffs meet within the next week to start <unk> the bill \r\n the senate agriculture committee is responding to trading abuses in the futures markets with a far-reaching bill that would become the futures trading practices act of N \r\n the proposed legislation has a <unk> goal to assure the integrity of the u.s. futures markets \r\n however as is common with sweeping legislation the proposal contains many provisions that could destroy important parts of the system it sets out to preserve \r\n the complex bill introduced by sens. patrick <unk> d. <unk> richard <unk> r. ind. and bob <unk> d. neb. covers a wide range of provisions that would affect the funding and authority of the commodity futures trading commission and would <unk> change the way the industry is regulated \r\n these include provisions relating to the technology and systems that must be employed by exchanges oversight and disciplinary procedures for exchange trading practices the relationship between commodity brokerage firms and floor traders and exchange <unk> \r\n the bill also <unk> even minor rule <unk> to <unk> and provides for recovery of punitive damages in civil lawsuits and arbitration cases without any showing of willful misconduct \r\n many aspects of the bill are <unk> providing appropriate public <unk> that can and should be instituted throughout the industry \r\n indeed some of the bill 's requirements including broad representation on the exchanges ' boards of directors and strong measures to prevent conflicts of interest already have been put in place by the coffee sugar & cocoa exchange and other futures exchanges \r\n other aspects of the bill however are either structured in ways that create unnecessary burdens for the industry or actually are harmful to the exchanges the industry and ultimately the general public \r\n one of the most prominent features is the requirement that in three years all exchanges have in place a system that records all trades by a source independent of the executing broker \r\n the new york futures exchanges have been working together to develop a trade recording system much like the one called for in the bill \r\n we would be <unk> to have such a system in place today \r\n but is it realistic for congress to mandate by a rigid deadline a system that has not yet been <unk> to <unk> studies \r\n what if the system does n't work \r\n what if the only system that does work is so expensive that at best only the largest exchanges can afford it \r\n cost is a key consideration because of the global sweep of the financial markets \r\n the u.s. futures exchanges compete world-wide as never before \r\n today trading in almost any commodity can be diverted from u.s. markets with just a few strokes of a <unk> \r\n all foreign markets are aggressively <unk> u.s. business \r\n in fact several london markets already offer lower costs for trading in the same or very similar contracts \r\n the u.s. exchanges need both market integrity and <unk> long-term growth depends on it \r\n the senate bill contains many provisions that will increase the costs of trading \r\n the most <unk> of these is the <unk> of service fees which will directly widen the cost spread between u.s. and foreign markets \r\n other provisions have a more <unk> but nonetheless real and <unk> effect on the international position of u.s. exchanges \r\n these include the extension of liability into areas beyond those established by judicial precedent and the expansion of liability to include punitive damages \r\n in addition to increasing costs as a result of greater financial exposure for members these measures could have other far-reaching <unk> \r\n one section of the bill would make all commodity brokerage firms and floor brokers liable for damages without willful misconduct \r\n nowhere in the federal securities law is simple negligence or <unk> action a source of liability under similar circumstances \r\n it is only logical to assume that the enactment of this provision will lead to increased litigation \r\n in an already <unk> business commodity brokerage firms may well decide to eliminate the risk and expense of dealing with the retail public <unk> the private individual of access to the markets \r\n another measure makes commodity brokerage firms liable for violations committed by independent floor brokers who execute trades for them \r\n this <unk> concept would <unk> these firms to potentially <unk> punitive damages \r\n faced with the virtually impossible task of <unk> the execution of each trade many commodity brokerage firms are likely to stop doing business with <unk> and instead hire their own <unk> floor brokers \r\n this would force out of business many of the individuals and small firms that function as floor brokers \r\n a consequence of their departure could be a serious <unk> of market liquidity \r\n finally under the bill a number of legitimate longstanding business practices would be <unk> banned unless the cftc were to take specific and timely action to permit them to continue \r\n in other words regulation will occur through <unk> and <unk> rather than through a normal <unk> procedure \r\n the affected practices include the placing of oral orders which is the way most public customer orders are placed and trading between affiliated brokers even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client \r\n also <unk> would be dual trading <unk> a broker trades for customers as well as his own account a practice that provides needed liquidity to the markets \r\n all u.s. futures exchanges agree that these and other trading practices require proper regulation and supervision \r\n nonetheless each has too much potential value to the system to be banned by legislative fiat before the cftc carefully considers all the consequences of a ban and what the regulatory alternatives are \r\n the markets are complex as is the environment in which they function \r\n when problems surface the temptation becomes strong to <unk> overhaul a market system that has served for more than N years \r\n that temptation must be put aside to permit careful consideration of all the implications positive and negative of the proposed resolutions to those problems and to avoid creating a marketplace where no one trades \r\n mr. <unk> is chairman of the coffee sugar & cocoa exchange in new york and director of commodity administration at shearson lehman hutton \r\n initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted N for the week ended oct.

N N N and N respectively \r\n it also provides for benefit adjustments including a partial restoration of <unk> and holidays as well as <unk> changes to increase productivity \r\n ground zero of the hud scandal is the secretary 's discretionary fund a <unk> pot used to fund projects that were n't approved through normal hud channels \r\n jack kemp wants to abolish it \r\n instead congress 's idea of reform is to increase this <unk> fund by $ N million \r\n and transfer control of much of it to capitol hill \r\n the hud scandals will simply continue but under new <unk> \r\n after one of the most amazing debates we 've ever seen on the cable channel <unk> the house voted N to N on wednesday to order $ N million in spending for a new jersey arts center a michigan library and N other pet projects out of the same discretionary fund that was supposed to have been so abused during sam <unk> 's tenure \r\n hud has no paper work <unk> on N of the projects none of the others has been approved and not a single congressional hearing has been held on any of them \r\n however four are in the michigan district of rep. bob <unk> the chairman of the house subcommittee that writes the hud spending bill \r\n of course this kind of <unk> congressional <unk> is called <unk> service by members while the same kind of <unk> <unk> at hud is labeled influence peddling \r\n unlike those awful republican consultants members do n't profit directly from hud projects \r\n they merely collect campaign contributions from developers that help keep them in office \r\n the N pet projects were discovered buried in the appropriations bill for hud and some other agencies after it returned from a conference committee that was called to resolve differences between the house and senate versions \r\n conference committees are breeding grounds for <unk> \r\n they are often closed to the public and no minutes are taken \r\n members find it easy to doctor legislation by slipping in special provisions that could never survive in the cold light of day \r\n in this case the members <unk> themselves \r\n rep. <unk> recently purchased an <unk> building lot on the island \r\n this is slightly adapted from remarks oct. N by former secretary of state george p. <unk> to an <unk> gathering at the stanford business school where he has returned to the faculty \r\n i was struck a couple of years ago by the <unk> effort in the <unk> \r\n we had <unk> during the year an estimated $ N billion street value of cocaine \r\n i do n't know how much got through \r\n nobody has any credible estimate \r\n the gnp of the <unk> is probably somewhere between one and two billion dollars \r\n so you get an idea of the leverage there and elsewhere that our market for drugs has brought about \r\n i welcome the emphasis that is now being put on the drug problem \r\n the efforts to get to the people who are <unk> try to <unk> them if they can not be <unk> at least to contain them to educate people to strongly discourage use of drugs by people who are casual users and first users to stop this process among the young all of these things i think are extremely important \r\n but i have to tell you that it seems to me that the conceptual base of the current program is flawed and the program is not likely to work \r\n the conceptual base a <unk> approach is the same that i have worked through before in the nixon administration when i was budget director and secretary of the treasury with jurisdiction over the customs \r\n we designed a comprehensive program and we worked hard on it \r\n in the reagan administration we designed a comprehensive program we worked very hard on it \r\n our international efforts were far greater than ever before \r\n you 're looking at a guy whose <unk> was attacked in <unk> by the drug <unk> so i 'm personally a veteran of this war \r\n what we have before us now is essentially the same program but with more resources <unk> into all of the efforts to enforce and control \r\n these efforts wind up creating a market where the price <unk> exceeds the cost \r\n with these incentives demand creates its own supply and a criminal network along with it \r\n it seems to me we 're not really going to get anywhere until we can take the <unk> out of the drug business and the incentives for <unk> out of it \r\n frankly the only way i can think of to accomplish this is to make it possible for <unk> to buy drugs at some regulated place at a price that <unk> their cost \r\n when you do that you wipe out the criminal incentives including i might say the incentive that the drug <unk> have to go around and get kids <unk> so that they create a market for themselves \r\n they wo n't have that incentive because they wo n't have that market \r\n so i think the conceptual base needs to be thought out in a different way \r\n if i am catching your attention then read a bold and <unk> article in this september 's issue of science by <unk> <unk> on this subject \r\n we need at least to consider and examine forms of controlled <unk> of drugs \r\n i find it very difficult to say that \r\n sometimes at a reception or <unk> party i advance these views and people head for somebody else \r\n they do n't even want to talk to you \r\n i know that i 'm shouting into the <unk> here as far as what we 're doing now \r\n but i feel that if somebody does n't get up and start talking about this now the next time around when we have the next <unk> of these programs it will still be true that everyone is scared to talk about it \r\n no politician wants to say what i just said not for a minute \r\n the u.s. economy grew at a moderate N N annual rate in the third quarter the same pace as the second quarter despite the worst trade performance in six years the commerce department reported \r\n personal spending buoyed by a burst of automobile buying was the main catalyst to the economy 's expansion \r\n but trade one of the economy 's main forces in the past few years showed a sharp deterioration \r\n imports of goods and services soared while exports were flat \r\n some economists found the <unk> <unk> \r\n for the past two years the foreign trade sector has been a major <unk> to economic growth \r\n you ca n't rely now solely on consumer spending to sustain the economy on a solid growth path said norman robertson chief economist at mellon bank in pittsburgh \r\n although the economy showed no change of pace from the second quarter many analysts expect it to slow considerably in the fourth quarter as demand for autos falls partly because of higher prices on models introduced last month \r\n many economists think the rise in the value of the u.s. dollar this year will further <unk> progress in trade because it makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper \r\n and business investment which slowed in the third quarter according to yesterday 's report is expected to continue to be sluggish \r\n a sharp reduction in inflation was by far the <unk> spot in the report on the real gross national product the inflation-adjusted market value of all the goods and services the economy produced \r\n an inflation gauge that measures the quarterly change in prices of an array of goods and services slowed its growth to a N N annual rate in the third quarter from N N in the second \r\n much of the <unk> came from declining energy prices which have since turned up a bit analysts said \r\n consequently michael <unk> undersecretary for economic affairs at the commerce department said inflation probably will edge up from the third-quarter rate in the final three months of N \r\n but he said he believes the second quarter 's N N rate will prove to have been this year 's peak quarterly inflation rate \r\n generally the bush administration expressed satisfaction with the economy 's progress as it heads into its eighth year of sustained growth next month \r\n treasury secretary nicholas brady called the N N pace good solid growth although he said he expects the expansion to slow in the fourth quarter \r\n he added inflation is lower than i think people expected it to be and i think that 's good news \r\n but administration officials were concerned over the bleak trade report which showed the deficit in the country 's trade of goods and services swelling to a $ N billion annual rate in the third quarter from a $ N billion rate in the second quarter \r\n mr. <unk> called it a disappointment but predicted exports will pick up again \r\n we were <unk> for the deterioration in net exports said daniel van <unk> vice president of u.s. forecasting at bank of america in san francisco \r\n i ca n't believe it will continue he added noting that the economies of the country 's major trading partners are strong and prices of u.s. products are still competitive \r\n some analysts also were <unk> by a pickup in the growth of business inventories \r\n while a buildup of these stocks adds to gnp it can hurt the economy because a <unk> of <unk> goods can lead to production cuts and layoffs \r\n according to the report inventories outside the farm sector grew at an annual rate of $ N billion in the third quarter up from a $ N billion pace in the second quarter \r\n manufacturers ' stocks <unk> at an $ N billion annual rate up from $ N billion \r\n that suggests there is a little more inventory <unk> than some people expected said edward boss senior financial economist at continental bank in chicago \r\n i do n't think it 's anything that 's going to cause a downturn in economic activity \r\n but it will slow production \r\n devastation from hurricane hugo which <unk> into the southeast coast in late september diminished personal income by about $ N billion the department said but it called the effect on the roughly $ N trillion economy negligible \r\n except for the loss from the hurricane all the figures were adjusted for seasonal factors and inflation \r\n here are some of the major components of the gross national product expressed in seasonally adjusted annual rates in billions of constant N dollars \r\n in the third quarter the implicit price deflator fell to N N of the N average from N N in the previous quarter \r\n northrop corp. received a $ N million contract by the u.s. air force for production <unk> and test equipment for the <unk> rainbow <unk> missile \r\n

N \r\n the company has about N million ordinary shares outstanding \r\n on the toronto stock exchange hudson 's bay shares closed at c$ N up N cents \r\n hudson 's bay said that <unk> co. which currently holds about N N of the ordinary shares will subscribe for all the shares to which it is entitled and for any shares that are n't otherwise taken up \r\n <unk> is a holding company owned by toronto 's thomson family \r\n hudson 's bay said it will redeem N million series <unk> preferred shares on oct. N at a price of c$ N each \r\n the move was approved at a special shareholders ' meeting yesterday \r\n gary <unk> chief financial officer said redemption of the preferred shares originally issued at

into a <unk> saw a defense department spending freeze \r\n iverson 's earnings plunged N N to $ N million \r\n the troubles continued in this year 's first half when profit plunged N N to $ N \r\n iverson technology is one of many small defense contractors besieged by the slowdown in defense spending \r\n unlike larger contractors with a broad enough base to weather the downturn easily these companies are suffering big drops in business as <unk> specialty <unk> in the massive military market erode or even disappear \r\n companies that only recently were thriving find themselves scrambling to survive \r\n as their <unk> strategies suggest there is more than one way to respond to a disaster though it 's too soon to tell whether the changes will pay off \r\n for many companies the <unk> first response is to cut costs \r\n others are trying to find specialty defense work <unk> by the slowdown or new <unk> created by <unk> \r\n more <unk> businesses are applying their skills in commercial fields \r\n <unk> international inc. which provides professional and technical services to the military is refining its defense niche not retreating from it \r\n after <unk> annual earnings over four years to $ N million in N the <unk> va. company posted a N N drop in earnings for this year 's first half \r\n in the belief that development of advanced military technology will remain a top defense department priority <unk> last year acquired <unk> <unk> associates a technical and scientific analysis company with contracts under the strategic defense initiative \r\n while the sdi

inc. an <unk> md. contractor that earned $ N million on revenue of $ N million in N has gone even further in <unk> its military business \r\n as orders for its aircraft and <unk> parts <unk> three years of steady growth ended with a N N drop in income in this year 's first half \r\n the company hit on a new strategy if the defense department is so intent on saving money why not make money off that trend \r\n among the company 's current efforts <unk> old parts at N N of the cost of replacing them \r\n <unk> also is selling new parts if needed directly to the military instead of through a prime contractor \r\n at as little as one-third of the government 's cost the company is running a program to train army helicopter pilots \r\n it is also taking over the maintenance of certain navy aircraft with N N fewer people than the military used \r\n in another approach tiny iverson technology is trying to resume its growth by <unk> the new world of commercial products \r\n donald iverson chairman says he hopes the company can eventually get up to half of its revenue from commercial markets \r\n for now he says we 're looking at buying some small companies with niche markets in the personal-computer business \r\n earlier this month mr. iverson agreed to buy exclusive rights to a software system developed by <unk> systems inc. salt lake city \r\n the product <unk> an array of functions performed at small to <unk> printing companies \r\n mr. iverson says there are N potential customers for the software in the washington d.c. area alone \r\n <unk> inc. falls church va. also

of shell oil co. recently <unk> a process for producing plastic food containers that wo n't <unk> in microwave <unk> \r\n we 're trying to take the <unk> and talent of our engineers and come up with new processes for industry says vincent <unk> <unk> 's chief executive \r\n it is an effort to branch out from the government which is very difficult for a defense contractor \r\n mr. <unk> should know \r\n instead of helping his company in the defense spending slowdown dynamic engineering inc. a troubled subsidiary that makes wind <unk> for the space industry contributed to much of <unk> 's $ N million loss on $ N million in revenue last year \r\n in january mr. <unk> sold the unit \r\n it was our first acquisition he says and it was a mistake \r\n some companies are cutting costs and hoping for the best \r\n <unk> corp. a santa <unk> calif. provider of <unk> and <unk> services to the military enjoyed steady growth until this year \r\n following a <unk> of earnings to $ N million on a doubling of revenue to $ N million over four years earnings in the company 's fiscal first quarter which ended june N plunged N N to $ N \r\n a one-time write-off for <unk> <unk> revenue was partly to blame but so were lower profits from a <unk> contract with the army and delays in getting paid \r\n <unk> responded by combining three of its five divisions to reduce expenses and bring more focus to potentially fewer bidding opportunities says lin <unk> <unk> chairman and controlling shareholder \r\n it 's evident we 're entering a more competitive era he says \r\n <unk> corp. a sherman <unk> calif. defense contractor that earned $ N million on revenue of $ N million in N provides a more dramatic example of cost-cutting \r\n the company not only merged three <unk> manufacturing operations but also closed an unrelated plant that makes <unk> devices used in fighter planes and missiles \r\n the closing contributed to a $ N million loss in the fiscal first quarter ended july N its first quarterly loss since N \r\n our <unk> business has been hurt very badly by the slowdown says <unk> <unk> <unk> 's chairman \r\n i would n't say we 're out of the business \r\n but we 're not

we like to make our own judgments about mr. morishita says christopher <unk> christies ' group managing director \r\n people have a different reputation country by country \r\n mr. morishita is a leading figure among japan 's N <unk> which lend to small companies and <unk> which lend to individuals \r\n many of these financiers lend freely often without demanding collateral \r\n but the interest rates they charge are often near japan 's N N legal limit says <unk> <unk> a lawyer specializing in loan troubles \r\n aichi is a <unk> mr. <unk> says and one of the nasty ones \r\n in

this man was and what his intentions were \r\n we 're an investor mr. morishita says sitting back in his <unk> gallery filled with some N <unk> and <unk> \r\n in the long run the stock prices will go up \r\n it 's not clear whether <unk> plans to buy more shares \r\n but christies mr. morishita insists is happy to see him become a long-term <unk> \r\n mr. morishita considers himself a <unk> of art

authorities over a two-year period \r\n the tokyo regional taxation office declines to comment and mr. <unk> the <unk> 's secretary says the problem simply resulted from a difference of opinion over what was considered income \r\n the small <unk> mr. morishita comes across as an outspoken man of the world \r\n stretching his arms in his <unk> white <unk> and <unk> his black shoes he <unk> a <unk> about the way to sell american real estate and boasts about his friendship with margaret thatcher 's son \r\n but when asked what exactly he does in business he immediately takes <unk> \r\n are you stupid he <unk> \r\n you should know what questions to ask to get people to answer \r\n not many people know the details of mr. morishita 's business but it 's a source of rumors about <unk> dealings \r\n when a small company goes <unk> for instance the <unk> weekly magazines are often quick to link the demise with aichi \r\n mr. morishita <unk> at those stories as well as the ones connecting him to the japanese <unk> \r\n he says he has never even <unk> with <unk> \r\n the seventh child of a store owner in aichi <unk> mr. morishita started out in the textile business \r\n from there he set up

bank holding company disclosed last friday that it had taken a huge $ N million provision for loan losses at the arizona bank the result of the state 's worsening real-estate market \r\n in yesterday 's report first interstate said its bank in texas also reported a loss of $ N million for the quarter \r\n but it said that its consumer banks in oregon california nevada and washington performed well during the quarter and that nonperforming assets at these banks declined by N N over the year-ago period \r\n private-sector union contracts signed in the third quarter granted slightly lower wage increases than those signed in the second quarter but wage increases still are running above last year 's levels \r\n the labor department said wage settlements in the third quarter called for average annual wage increases of N N in the first year and N N over the life of the contracts \r\n the last time parties to these settlements negotiated wage increases mostly in N or N wages increased an average of N N a year over the life of the contracts \r\n if this pattern continues the labor department said N will be the first year that the measure has shown an increase since N when the department started <unk> <unk> contracts with those that replaced them \r\n this reflects the restoration of wage cuts in the steel and other industries as well as higher wages granted nurses who work in health-care facilities \r\n settlements reached in the first nine months of N called for wage increases averaging N N in the first contract year and N N annually over the life of the contracts the department said \r\n for all of N union contracts provided for N N wage increases in the first year and N N over the life of the contracts \r\n in the second quarter contracts called for increases of N N in the first year and N N over the life of the contracts \r\n the figures exclude <unk> payments and cost-of-living adjustments so the actual wage increases may have been bigger \r\n about N N of the workers covered by contracts signed in the first nine months of year get <unk> payments about N N are covered by cost-of-living <unk> \r\n unions covered by one or other provisions generally settled for lower percentage wage increases \r\n the labor department said wage increases in manufacturing industries continue to be smaller than those in other industries \r\n for all six million

<unk> has succeeded where the government has failed he has made speaking filipino respectable \r\n the N <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a character who stars in the children 's television show batibot \r\n he speaks only in filipino \r\n batibot which started in N as a hybrid of the u.s. program <unk> street has developed into a <unk> philippine effort \r\n radio programs and books have followed the daily television show \r\n in the process batibot an <unk> filipino word meaning strong or <unk> has become a powerful advocate of the use of the filipino language \r\n it <unk> on ordinary young <unk> that there 's nothing to feel <unk> about in using their own language says <unk> david a sociologist and host of a popular television talk show \r\n when we started the program six years ago the use of filipino was deemed <unk> by the <unk> middle class says <unk> brown the program 's <unk> \r\n now she says it 's no longer an issue \r\n the success of batibot stands in marked contrast to many academic and government attempts to promote filipino as a national language \r\n filipino once known as <unk> is <unk> <unk> the <unk> language spoken in a part of the country 's principal island of luzon \r\n resistance to a national language comes primarily from members of the country 's elite who generally prefer english \r\n but while <unk> <unk> are quick to cite the logic in using a language as widespread as english they are often slow to reveal that they are <unk> against filipino say advocates of the native language \r\n for the middle and <unk> class filipino is <unk> says <unk> <unk> a <unk> professor at <unk> city 's university of the philippines \r\n there 's also <unk> \r\n other opponents of filipino come from <unk> regions \r\n they argue that their own <unk> should have equal weight although recent surveys indicate that the majority of the country 's population understands filipino more than any other language \r\n there are seven major <unk> and more than N <unk> in the country \r\n what <unk> to speak is an emotional mine field in the philippines \r\n it is entrenched in the country 's colonial bonds to the u.s. in philippine class structure in the regional <unk> of its people and in its island geography \r\n as they did when the philippines was a colony of the u.s. teachers for the most part teach in english even though it is a foreign language for most philippine children \r\n as a result they often speak one language at home another at school \r\n mrs. brown calls the <unk> cultural <unk> to filipino a language <unk> \r\n the issue has been <unk> for years \r\n it does n't take much to <unk> an intense debate \r\n when president <unk> aquino whose command of filipino is <unk> announced last year that the language would be used in official communications there was an <unk> from many legislators who continue to conduct debates mostly in english \r\n but many proponents of filipino see resistance to the language finally crumbling \r\n they believe the media including batibot have played a crucial role \r\n according to chief <unk> <unk> <unk> batibot does n't set out to advance the cause of filipino \r\n it 's not as if we 're teaching language per <unk> he says we 're just using it \r\n these days batibot is produced in a converted <unk> on a <unk> budget of $ N a one-hour segment \r\n it is shown <unk> on two of the country 's five networks \r\n with an audience totaling more than N batibot consistently ranks in the country 's <unk> <unk> <unk> programs \r\n but advertising revenue is inadequate \r\n <unk> there are threats that the program will <unk> \r\n batibot lacks the polish of <unk> street \r\n sound stages echo \r\n acting sometimes falls flat \r\n there are only two large <unk> in the program <unk> <unk> and a <unk> named <unk> <unk> \r\n but the production is the equal of any local program \r\n and the show 's creativity makes up for any technological deficiencies \r\n the program is n't afraid to tackle controversial topics such as nuclear weapons and the environment \r\n not that the language war is won even on batibot \r\n during one recent episode all the advertisements were in english \r\n cms energy corp. said management would recommend to its board today that its common stock dividend be <unk> at a modest level later this year \r\n the dearborn mich. energy company

\r\n the acquisition boosted black & decker 's ratio of debt to total capital to more than N N \r\n company officials have said they plan to reduce that ratio to less than N N over the next N N years \r\n earlier this year black & decker put three emhart businesses on the auction block the information and electronics segment the <unk> electrical assembly business and <unk> <unk> \r\n the three

raise $ N million by charging companies $ N for the honor of filing the required papers under the hart-scott-rodino law \r\n ever since the bad days of big is bad antitrust enforcement this law has required that anyone proposing a merger must make a filing describing the effects on all relevant markets \r\n the <unk> filing is then reviewed and any antitrust concerns usually met \r\n typically <unk> is used now to give managers of target firms early news of a bid and a chance to use regulatory review as a delaying <unk> \r\n the $ N tax would be a small cost in a multibillion-dollar deal but a serious drag on thousands of small friendly deals \r\n one especially dangerous aspect to the new tax would be that the proceeds will be used to increase the budgets of the antitrust division at justice and the federal trade commission \r\n this amounts to a <unk> for regulators the more <unk> the more they get to keep \r\n also as former reagan antitrust chief charles rule has noted this

doing anything besides managing current company business \r\n but sources said he will be urging his allies to boost their stakes in navigation mixte which is being traded in london and is to resume trading in paris tuesday \r\n at the same time he is expected to seek legal and regulatory means of blocking or delaying paribas 's bid \r\n for the moment the sources said he has decided against seeking a white knight or organizing a <unk> for paribas \r\n mr. fournier said navigation mixte 's N unconsolidated or <unk> profit is likely to be N billion francs $ N million up from N million francs last year \r\n that is due mostly to payments from allianz for most of the N N stake it has agreed to acquire in navigation mixte 's insurance business \r\n mr. fournier said the <unk> gain would mean nearly twice as high a dividend this year as last \r\n if holders avoid <unk> to paribas he added they can expect strong dividends again next year \r\n analysts noted that over the past N

once he realized that paribas 's intentions were n't friendly he said but before the bid was launched he sought approval to boost his paribas stake above N N \r\n the petition is still pending but mr. fournier <unk> the likelihood of his organizing a takeover bid of his own for the <unk> paribas \r\n one big question now is the likely role of mr. fournier 's allies \r\n mr. fournier said the large institutions that hold nearly N N of navigation mixte 's capital all strongly support him but some analysts said they are n't so sure \r\n allianz for example has said in official comments so far that it will remain neutral \r\n paribas is allianz 's lead french bank \r\n paribas said monday that it intends to bid to boost its stake in navigation mixte to N N from the N N it already owns \r\n the

rights and N francs each for a block of shares issued july N which will receive only partial dividends this year \r\n alternatively it is to offer three paribas shares for one navigation mixte share

N auto maker blamed incentive costs and reduced production both the result of a substantially weaker u.s. market for a N N drop in net to $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N billion \r\n nearly all the decline came in ford 's u.s. automotive operations \r\n the dearborn mich. auto maker ran a loss of $ N million on <unk> and marketing cars in the u.s. a deterioration of $ N million in that line from the N quarter \r\n ford managed to show a profit for the quarter primarily because of earnings from overseas auto operations and financial services \r\n a year earlier ford reported record net of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N billion \r\n in the latest nine months ford earned $ N billion or $ N a share compared with $ N billion or $ N a share \r\n the u.s. automotive loss was a sharp reversal for a company that had <unk> off N consecutive quarters of improved earnings until the N second quarter \r\n but david n. <unk> vice president finance insisted that cost-cutting and tight production capacity will make results better in this downturn than in prior <unk> when ford had net losses \r\n still mr. <unk> said ford expects the u.s. economy to weaken through the end of N causing weaker sales and production \r\n as a result fourth-quarter profit will come in below N results although the drop wo n't be as sharp as the N N third-quarter decline he said \r\n part of the drop will come from an anticipated charge of as much as $ N million from the proposed sale of its rouge steel unit \r\n in the N fourth quarter ford had net of $ N billion or $ N a share \r\n chrysler 's operating profit fell to a <unk> $ N million or N cents a share its lowest quarterly total in seven years \r\n its $ N million or $ N a share gain from the sale of N million mitsubishi shares made net $ N million or $ N a share \r\n sales were flat at $ N billion \r\n the results include record quarterly earnings of $ N million from chrysler financial corp \r\n a year earlier chrysler 's net was $ N million or N cents a share \r\n mr. miller said costs of incentives caused a moderate loss in the highland park mich. company 's north american car and truck business \r\n he said the loss was n't that much different from ford 's $ N million loss on u.s. automotive operations but he declined to be specific \r\n mr. miller said chrysler spent an average of $ N a vehicle on its incentive programs in the third quarter compared with about $ N a vehicle a year earlier a <unk> mark at the time \r\n he said chrysler is no longer sure of its forecast for industry car and truck sales of N million in the N model year \r\n consumers he said are <unk> at higher prices on N cars especially after seeing the <unk> prices on N models \r\n in the nine months net was $ N billion or $ N a share including the gain from the mitsubishi stock sale compared with $ N million or $ N a share after a charge of $ N million or N cents a share for plant closings in the N period \r\n sales rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion \r\n heavy losses in north american auto operations sent gm 's net tumbling to $ N million from a record $ N million \r\n <unk> gm does n't issue separate quarterly earnings for the north american automotive business \r\n but analysts estimated that gm had a loss of as much as $ N million on domestic vehicle operations \r\n an N N drop in north american factory sales of cars and trucks cut into revenue and rebates to dealers and customers more than offset gains from price increases on N model vehicles delivered during the period a gm spokesman said \r\n but gm 's results also illustrate the increasing diversity of its operations \r\n in one breakdown gm attributed half of its net to its two big technology units electronic data systems corp. and gm hughes electronics corp \r\n meanwhile gm said overseas auto operations are on track to exceed last year 's record full-year net of $ N billion \r\n the diversified operations helped gm build its cash reserves exclusive of its financial subsidiary to $ N billion as of sept. N a N N increase from a year earlier \r\n this cushion could come in handy if gm has to trim fourth-quarter north american production schedules more than the already scheduled N N \r\n under the circumstances it wo n't be easy for gm to exceed its record N fourth-quarter net of $ N billion the spokesman acknowledged \r\n that means it 's unlikely the company will <unk> last year 's $ N billion full-year profit even though net for the first nine months was up N N to $ N billion on revenue of $ N billion \r\n it earned $ N billion on revenue of $ N billion in the N nine months \r\n there are two versions of measure for measure on stage at the alley theater here \r\n one is a strong vigorous portrayal of shakespeare 's play the other is director gregory boyd 's <unk> of <unk> <unk> rock <unk> on old vienna \r\n measure for measure is one of shakespeare 's problem plays so named because it does not fit neatly into a category such as tragedy comedy or history \r\n its <unk> and uneasy <unk> of the serious and the comic is no doubt one reason why it is very much in <unk> with directors just now \r\n last season hartford stage director mark <unk> mounted a production at lincoln center and currently two other productions one just closed at the old globe in san diego and another now at the seattle rep <unk> with mr. boyd 's \r\n in the play the duke of vienna <unk> over the <unk> of his subjects and turns over the rule of the city to the <unk> angelo hoping he can set things right \r\n when angelo <unk> that the young man <unk> has made his <unk> pregnant before he could <unk> her angelo <unk> <unk> <unk> to death \r\n when however <unk> 's sister <unk> a <unk> in a <unk> goes to angelo to plead her brother 's case the <unk> <unk> immediately falls in love with her and in a supreme act of <unk> demands that <unk> yield up her virtue to him in exchange for her brother 's life \r\n meanwhile the duke who set the original scheme in motion appears on the scene <unk> as a <unk> and becomes involved in a series of <unk> that has everyone <unk> the worst possible outcome until the duke <unk> a last minute <unk> for all concerned \r\n for the alley production scene designer peter david gould has arranged a stark but extremely effective set featuring a <unk> platform of <unk> boards that <unk> into the audience \r\n when the action requires a prison cell consisting of an <unk> wire <unk> rolls forward on iron wheels on the platform \r\n in the play 's major scenes mr. boyd demonstrates that he has a firm grasp of the <unk> dynamic \r\n when <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> her brother <unk> <unk> <unk> in his cell explaining the price she has been asked to secure his freedom when <unk> and the <unk> duke philip <unk> <unk> to <unk> angelo and when <unk> <unk> jefferies a woman <unk> by angelo <unk> him with his past <unk> the performers bring the dramatic high points to life with intense energy and intelligence \r\n at such moments mr. boyd makes it clear that he has the capacity to be a superior <unk> of shakespeare \r\n when however he decides to be modern or more accurately when he decides to be trendy the results are far less satisfactory \r\n mr. boyd is of the <unk> school that believes one must find modern parallels or <unk> to make shakespeare accessible to today 's audiences \r\n it 's a valid approach but it puts a heavy burden on the director to show an uncommon degree of <unk> and taste \r\n in his measure mr. boyd has <unk> the <unk> and <unk> of vienna whom angelo is supposed to bring under control by converting them into <unk> <unk> <unk> and heavy metal types with a strong emphasis on leather chains and <unk> <unk> \r\n loud rock music <unk> all the scene changes even those in the <unk> \r\n when <unk> is arrested he is brought on stage <unk> except for the <unk> on his <unk> and <unk> \r\n when the <unk> <unk> jack <unk> visits the <unk> to inform <unk> of her brother 's fate <unk> not only <unk> the mother superior on her rear but brings along a <unk> companion <unk> <unk> not in shakespeare 's script to <unk> <unk> \r\n meanwhile the <unk> <unk> <unk> allen <unk> dressed in black leather and a prominent <unk> <unk> in enough <unk> gestures and <unk> <unk> to launch a space probe \r\n the problem here is not in the concept but in its lack of discrimination \r\n the <unk> at one point for example of a list of <unk> <unk> <unk> ranging from jim bakker and <unk> helmsley to <unk> <unk> <unk> is a bid for a cheap <unk> <unk> of mr. boyd 's ability \r\n despite the excesses however the <unk> for the production has many more <unk> than <unk> \r\n what 's more it represents an important step for the alley theater \r\n measure for measure is mr. boyd 's first <unk> <unk> as the theater 's new artistic director \r\n he succeeded pat brown who was fired by the alley board N months ago \r\n her dismissal angered many in the regional theater establishment and led peter <unk> head of theatre communications group to write an editorial in american theatre magazine <unk> the board \r\n none of this backlash could change the fact that ms. brown 's regime was <unk> <unk> and <unk> \r\n now the alley has moved ahead on both artistic and financial fronts \r\n not only is mr. boyd giving the theater a new sense of <unk> and excitement on stage the balance sheet is the best the theater has had in N years \r\n as opposed to the $ N million deficit of the N season the N year concluded with a $ N surplus and a $ N cash reserve \r\n <unk> last season 's runaway hit steel <unk> helped a lot but so did cost cutting and other measures insisted on by the board \r\n only time will tell if mr. boyd can restore to the alley the <unk> it received when its founder <unk> <unk> was at the <unk> of her powers \r\n but it is clear he is going to give it a shot \r\n democratic leaders have bottled up president bush 's capital-gains tax cut in the senate and may be able to prevent a vote on the issue indefinitely \r\n senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine said he intends to use senate procedures to force advocates of the tax cut to come up with at least N votes before they can address the issue \r\n and neither democrats nor republicans are predicting that the capital-gains forces can produce enough votes \r\n the <unk> requirement will be there and they do n't have the N votes sen. mitchell said \r\n they do n't have the votes to get it passed \r\n sen. bob packwood r. ore. the leading republican <unk> of the tax cut did n't disagree \r\n i 'm not sure what 's going to happen he said \r\n previously he had said he would be able to find the <unk> N votes eventually \r\n sen. packwood has offered his <unk> package as an amendment to a bill now pending in the senate that would <unk> aid to poland and hungary \r\n democrats are holding up a vote on the amendment by threatening a <unk> or extended debate \r\n for a <unk> vote to stop the

to press for a vote on the amendment to the eastern europe aid measure \r\n and they threatened to try to <unk> any other revenue bill in the senate with the capital-gains provision \r\n this is serious business we 're serious about a capital-gains reduction said kansas sen. robert dole the senate 's republican leader \r\n the strategy is let 's vote \r\n the republicans contend that they can <unk> a majority in the <unk> senate for a capital-gains tax cut \r\n they accuse the democrats of unfairly using senate rules to <unk> a <unk> hurdle \r\n democrats counter that the republicans have often used the same rules to suit their own ends \r\n the two sides also traded accusations about the cost of the packwood plan \r\n democrats asserted that the proposal which also would create a new type of individual retirement account was <unk> with budget <unk> that would lose billions of dollars in the long run \r\n republicans <unk> that <unk> revenue estimates were <unk> \r\n the packwood proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held \r\n it also would create a new ira that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes including retirement medical expenses <unk> purchases and tuition \r\n a white house spokesman said president bush is generally supportive of the packwood plan \r\n marsh & mclennan cos. said

companies will be able to buy insurance from carriers in any other ec country for the first time \r\n that 's why we have been working hard to develop a single more unified presence in europe said

european market ahead of N \r\n but most u.s. insurers have n't rushed to change the way they do business in europe because they believe the european market will still be dominated by a handful of domestic companies \r\n under the proposed combination marsh & mclennan would gain a majority stake in <unk> & <unk> that would increase over time to the rest of the remaining N N \r\n the three managing general partners would receive a significant number of marsh & mclennan shares said <unk> l. <unk> a partner who would also join marsh & mclennan 's board \r\n mr. <unk> said he sought the

economic affairs is to hold its first auction of foreign currency \r\n soviet companies <unk> western currencies to buy equipment and supplies abroad will be able to submit bids \r\n plans for the auction which was supposed to take place last spring and become a regular event have been <unk> by a lack of hard currency \r\n soviet firms that hold some are unwilling to part with it and joint ventures are n't yet allowed to participate \r\n the kremlin also has been unwilling to provide hard currency for the auction using a lot of it instead to finance emergency imports of consumer goods \r\n if foreign tourists and businesses could sell their currencies freely at the new better exchange rate that would enable the state bank to increase its dollar reserves and would <unk> up some of the excess rubles in the economy at the same time \r\n but the amounts they exchange may be limited most soviet hotels for example demand payment in hard currency from western visitors \r\n unless other rules are changed the devaluation could cause difficulties for the people it is primarily meant to help soviets who travel abroad \r\n over the past three years thousands of people here have made use of <unk> travel restrictions to get their first taste of life abroad \r\n but under current rules they are allowed to change just N rubles into dollars and other currencies for each trip \r\n at the new rate that would give them about $ N to travel on \r\n it is n't yet clear whether the <unk> limit will be lifted \r\n if it is n't the black market for dollars probably will continue to <unk> \r\n international business machines corp. made news this summer when it landed an unusual contract to manage all of eastman kodak co. 's <unk> needs \r\n but the computer giant appears to have lost a second key contract with kodak to archrival digital equipment corp \r\n kodak yesterday confirmed that it has entered negotiations with maynard <unk> digital to manage all of its voice and data communications needs \r\n kodak based in rochester n.y. said ibm also had bid for the business \r\n ibm is based in armonk n.y \r\n the loss is a setback to ibm which pointed to the kodak contract as an example of its success in systems integration \r\n that 's an emerging business in which computer makers or consultants provide <unk> communications and computing services to major corporations \r\n a kodak spokesman declined to disclose the potential value of the contract which is still in negotiation \r\n he said that american telephone & telegraph mci communications corp. rochester telephone corp. and ibm itself would likely be digital 's <unk> on the project \r\n when we decided to look outside the company for critical <unk> and communications services we wanted to get the best vendor for that service said paul allen the spokesman \r\n that 's why we went with ibm for data center management and now digital for voice and data telecommunications \r\n this year is the <unk> anniversary of the federal reserve system and some members of congress think it 's time to take a fresh look at the nation 's central bank \r\n after N years there may be a few things that are worth <unk> \r\n the regional federal reserve bank <unk> for instance may be out of date \r\n in earlier years it may have seemed reasonable to give richmond va. a bank and allow los angeles only a branch of the san francisco bank but times have changed \r\n maybe the whole regional system is an <unk> the fed after all is a national central bank \r\n some of the would-be reformers however want to restore an arrangement we once had or at least part of it \r\n in the beginning the treasury secretary and the comptroller of the currency were both <unk> <unk> members of the federal reserve board \r\n but in N when congress was trying to find someone or something to blame for the great depression it decided to drop both the secretary and the comptroller from the board \r\n carter glass a former treasury secretary who was then back in congress probably influenced the decision \r\n he said that when he was on the board he felt that he had a great deal of power and somehow he did n't think that was a good thing \r\n times have changed \r\n rep. <unk> <unk> d. <unk> has introduced a bill in congress <unk> by rep. lee hamilton d. ind. that would put the treasury secretary back on the board \r\n there is doubt that the change would accomplish much but at least congress as in N would be doing something \r\n so far no one has suggested putting the comptroller back on the board \r\n nicholas brady the incumbent treasury secretary is of course aware of the proposal and he does n't like it much \r\n mr. <unk> has changed tactics dropping the <unk> idea \r\n that may have pleased the secretary but h. erich <unk> chief economist of the investment firm of <unk> <unk> & co. suggests that mr. brady may figure he already has all the power he needs \r\n like most treasury secretaries mr. brady takes a keen interest in monetary matters of course \r\n he was in fact taking an especially keen interest in board matters even before he went to the treasury \r\n after the october N market crash mr. brady as a private citizen headed a presidential commission that tried to decide what went wrong and what should be done about it \r\n one of the commission 's recommendations was that a single agency probably the federal reserve should coordinate regulation of all financial markets \r\n this recommendation might have encouraged a <unk> bureaucrat to try to expand his power but so far federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has n't made a pitch for the job \r\n the fed has plenty of responsibilities in times of market turmoil and in N and again in N it appears to have handled them well \r\n mr. brady has said he thought government agencies in the latest market drop were better prepared to coordinate their actions but he has left no doubt that he still likes the ideas the commission advanced nearly two years ago \r\n in recent weeks moreover mr. brady has joined other administration officials in trying to urge the fed toward lower interest rates \r\n the urging <unk> has been <unk> \r\n in an interview with the washington post in early october the secretary said the fed may be slightly more interested in curbing inflation than the administration is while the administration may put slightly more emphasis on spurring economic growth \r\n at least some economists of course would argue that inflation deserves a lot of emphasis \r\n earlier this month the st. louis fed held a conference to assess the system 's first N years \r\n <unk> <unk> a <unk> university economist noted that the fed 's record included the longest most sustained <unk> inflation in our history dating from either N or N to N \r\n the <unk> argument is an old one but mr. brady on the board or off is surely trying to influence fed policy \r\n equally <unk> the treasury secretary has <unk> the administration effort to bring the u.s. dollar down by shopping <unk> for west german marks and japanese yen \r\n the treasury can do something on its own but to have any hope of success it needs help from the fed \r\n the central bank has been helping but apparently not especially <unk> \r\n the fed has been <unk> in foreign currency markets all right but through august at least it appeared to be <unk> the intervention \r\n in other words it was offsetting purchases of marks and yen by buying dollars in the domestic money market \r\n now <unk> intervention may have some effect \r\n when traders see the fed is in the exchange market it may make them <unk> a little carefully for fear of what the central bank may do \r\n but it 's generally accepted that <unk> intervention has little or no lasting impact on currency values \r\n after august the fed may have stopped <unk> but it 's hard to see much impact on the dollar \r\n the dollar is still highly volatile \r\n the fed has let interest rates slip slightly but whether the main reason was dollar intervention the gloomy reports on manufacturing employment or the friday N market drop only mr. greenspan and his associates know \r\n earlier this year martin <unk> president of the national bureau of economic research argued <unk> that a government that wants steady stable exchange rates might try some steady stable economic policies \r\n trying to manage exchange rates to some <unk> level he said would mean <unk> monetary and fiscal policies from their <unk> roles and thereby <unk> excessive inflation and unemployment and inadequate capital formation \r\n the more we think about it the more we suspect mr. brady does indeed have enough power where he already is \r\n this has been a week of stunning events behind what was once called the iron <unk> and interesting shifts in official american policy toward moscow \r\n it has also been a week when <unk> washington has had a high old time <unk> over <unk> reagan 's multimillion-dollar <unk> in japan \r\n the latter may seem oddly irrelevant if not downright <unk> given the big picture and the way we have handled it in the nation 's capital has done nothing to <unk> that impression \r\n in fact however mr. reagan 's casual <unk> of the office he so recently held raises issues about which americans can actually do something \r\n our ability to influence the outcome of events in eastern europe and the soviet union is far more marginal \r\n those events continue to move at a rate and in a direction which leave informed commentary let alone policy far in their wake \r\n earlier this week soviet foreign minister eduard a. shevardnadze confessed that the u.s.s.r. ignored universal human values by <unk> afghanistan and to put it <unk> engaged in a violation of the abm treaty by building its radar station at krasnoyarsk \r\n hungary is no longer a socialist peoples republic the communist party no longer has automatic delegates in the u.s.s.r. 's congress of peoples deputies and egon krenz was not backed unanimously by his fellow party <unk> when he took over as east germany 's new maximum leader \r\n all of that is just for <unk> or so the hundreds of thousands of eastern europeans in the streets seem to hope and are certainly demanding \r\n of like though lesser note secretary of state james baker put the administration <unk> behind perestroika and glasnost and therefore behind mikhail gorbachev in a pair of carefully <unk> <unk> over the past week or so \r\n and last but not least president george bush now views the changes in eastern europe as absolutely extraordinary and believes that mr. krenz ca n't turn the <unk> back in east germany because the change is too <unk> as he told the new york times 's <unk> apple jr \r\n in other words after some highly visible <unk> and public airing of differences the administration has come down on the side of those who believe that what we are <unk> from berlin to <unk> is a good thing to be welcomed rather than a new thing to be feared or viewed with <unk> \r\n all of this is what history will note assuming that events do n't make it seem a bad joke when the record of this time is put down \r\n for journalists however who write what they <unk> view as history 's first draft this has also been a week to give a lot of space and time to ron and nancy 's sales appearance in japan on behalf of a communications giant and its controversial founder \r\n it has been a <unk> transaction this <unk> away of the prestige of the republic 's highest office \r\n the japanese <unk> has <unk> up at least $ N million the japanese government has put up just about as much or so it is reported and at least one estimate puts the total <unk> at $ N million \r\n all of which has enabled those of us in washington who enjoy <unk> in such things to go into high public <unk> as mr. apple and i did the other night on abc 's <unk> \r\n <unk> away we raised what i still think were all the right issues and landed more than one hard blow but at the end of the affair there was just the <unk> nagging worry that we had been aiming at the wrong target \r\n as one of his defenders so <unk> put it president reagan was simply doing what he had always done before his election and some would say thereafter as well \r\n he was performing for pay and why should anyone expect anything more \r\n primarily because there 's more to the matter than ronald reagan 's personal values or lack of them \r\n selling the presidency for a mess of <unk> is not so much a devaluation from the <unk> of public life today as it is a reflection of the <unk> of public standards \r\n the theme song for the 1980s has been anything goes and it has been <unk> with <unk> from wall street to some of the highest <unk> of <unk> \r\n there are those who say that this is nothing new that america has always suffered from a bad case of <unk> when it comes to the <unk> between what is <unk> and what is practiced \r\n there is evidence to support that view \r\n <unk> years ago william james wrote to <unk> wells the moral <unk> born of the exclusive <unk> of the <unk> <unk> success that with the <unk> cash interpretation put on the word success is our national disease \r\n but if it was the national disease in N it is today the national <unk> \r\n if there is no law against it do it \r\n if the law leaves <unk> use them \r\n if there is no moral prohibition that <unk> <unk> it full speed ahead \r\n and if you are caught or if people complain simply argue that everyone does it or no one said i should n't and <unk> it out \r\n as a last <unk> when all else has failed and you are <unk> <unk> for having disappointed those who trusted you but deny having actually done anything wrong \r\n see for instance jim bakker 's remarks upon being sentenced to prison this tuesday for <unk> the <unk> \r\n consider the troubling <unk> between mr. shevardnadze 's speech of <unk> this week and the <unk> defense of everyone concerned with the iran-contra affair \r\n the soviet foreign minister publicly concedes that his government violated <unk> of behavior in afghanistan and just plain <unk> about the radar station \r\n we have people in high place still lying through their teeth about iran-contra and that apparently is n't going to change \r\n for that matter those long ago identified as <unk> are still given <unk> hearings in the press \r\n that is the key to the current national disease \r\n no one seems willing to hold anyone in public life to a standard higher than the <unk> construction of the law \r\n the <unk> media <unk> hunt about some politician 's private <unk> notwithstanding the general <unk> is to offer a version of the old <unk> who am i to judge \r\n thus no standards no judgment and no values \r\n you are mad because he 's making so much money say president reagan 's defenders \r\n no we ought to be mad because he has <unk> the office we gave him <unk> it in the service of private gain just as we ought to be mad that public officials lie through their teeth play <unk> games about their activities or to steal a phrase make public service a private trough \r\n i 'm not going to be <unk> into <unk> to any of this president bush told mr. apple in this week 's interview \r\n he was referring to the absolutely extraordinary events in eastern europe and it is a <unk> position \r\n but there is no defense at all for the <unk> of the 1980s \r\n we did n't <unk> into it we <unk> and slipped down the long <unk> and now we have as its <unk> symbol a former president <unk> for a foreign <unk> \r\n or perhaps that is a <unk> symbol for the united states of N everything for sale nothing of real value \r\n mr. carter is a political <unk> who heads a television production firm \r\n cineplex odeon corp. directors said the company 's chairman and chief executive <unk> drabinsky is considering bidding N million canadian dollars us$ N million to acquire the company \r\n the board said mr. drabinsky and vice chairman <unk> <unk> are negotiating financing before offering c$ N a share to acquire all of cineplex 's shares outstanding \r\n the directors added that the two executives have n't reached a final decision to proceed with a bid and that until an offer is made the board will continue seeking higher offers from other bidders \r\n the directors said if messrs. drabinsky and <unk> mail an offer to shareholders by nov. N it will reimburse them a maximum of c$ N million for expenses related to a bid \r\n we consider that his bid is an acceptable bid said <unk> <unk> spokeswoman for the independent directors ' committee appointed last may to <unk> and review bids for the company in the wake of a dispute between mr. drabinsky and cineplex 's major shareholder mca inc \r\n mca and cineplex 's other major shareholder <unk> financier charles bronfman and his associates have agreed to tender their holdings to an offer by mr. drabinsky unless a higher offer is made by another bidder \r\n mca holds half of cineplex 's equity and N N of its voting rights through restricted voting shares while bronfman interests hold about N N of the company 's equity \r\n ms. <unk> said the committee had received other bids \r\n she declined to identify other bidders but said mr. drabinsky 's offer is all cash and it 's for all of the company \r\n several cineplex analysts have speculated that outside bids received by the committee were either <unk> low or for only part of the company \r\n all this has really established is that mca and the <unk> have agreed on a price at which they can be bought out said <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> in los angeles \r\n if a bid <unk> at that price shareholders will have every reason to be glad but the question of financing still remains \r\n last april mr. drabinsky and a group of financial backers planned to acquire up to N N of cineplex for c$ N a share from bronfman associates \r\n mr. drabinsky who would have had the right to vote those shares for two years said the purchase subsequently rejected by regulators was aimed at consolidating his control of the company \r\n mca strongly opposed the drabinsky group 's move \r\n the directors did n't indicate the source of financing for mr. drabinsky 's new proposal but said mca and the bronfman associates agreed in principle to buy for $ N million and then lease back to cineplex its <unk> theater complex in universal city calif. if mr. drabinsky succeeds in an offer \r\n this is being done at the suggestion of mr. drabinsky and to accommodate him to facilitate his financing arrangements ms. <unk> said \r\n in addition the directors said if a bid by mr. drabinsky is successful cineplex expects rank <unk> plc to acquire the N N of cineplex 's film house unit it does n't own and provide mr. drabinsky with additional loan financing \r\n michael <unk> rank 's chief executive said the british theater chain 's total involvement would n't exceed $ N million but declined to give a breakdown between the loan financing and the proposed film house purchase \r\n cineplex shareholders responded <unk> to yesterday 's announcement \r\n in trading on the new york stock exchange cineplex closed at $ N down N cents with more than a million shares changing hands \r\n on the toronto stock exchange cineplex closed at c$ N off N canadian cents well below the c$ N level \r\n where 's the bid asked pierre <unk> an analyst and broker with toronto securities dealer <unk> st. lawrence ltd \r\n mr. <unk> said he does n't think messrs. drabinsky and <unk> are anywhere close to arranging financing and that investors will need a solid offer before the stock begins to rise again \r\n mr. drabinsky could n't be reached for comment \r\n two west german chemical companies announced steps that apparently are designed to boost the chemical industry 's standing among environmental groups and the general public \r\n hoechst ag 's chairman <unk> <unk> said the company wants to have a substitute product to completely replace <unk> chlorofluorocarbons by N \r\n in april hoechst the largest producer of cfcs in west germany said it wanted to reduce production of the product by N N by N \r\n mr. <unk> said hoechst will invest N million marks $ N million in a plant to make a substitute product it has developed that it says is <unk> \r\n the company hopes the new plant likely to be built in frankfurt will be able to produce N tons a year \r\n this year hoechst will produce about N tons of cfcs in factories in frankfurt spain and brazil \r\n of hoechst 's N billion marks in group sales in N N million marks came from sales of cfcs \r\n also <unk> ag another large chemicals company said it formed a separate division that will study the environmental impact of plastics and will investigate all possibilities of recycling plastics \r\n george l. <unk> N years old senior vice president of texas eastern corp. was elected a group vice president of this <unk> concern \r\n mr. <unk> who succeeds retiring richard c. <unk> will be responsible for gas supply regulatory affairs and marketing and transportation and exchange for <unk> eastern pipe line co. <unk> gas co. texas eastern transmission corp. and <unk> gas transmission co \r\n all of the companies are units of <unk> eastern corp. which acquired texas eastern corp. earlier this year \r\n <unk> coors co. said its coors brewing co. unit will test market a new line of bottled water in the west beginning early next year \r\n the move which was expected marks the first time since prohibition that coors has sold a <unk> beverage and marks the company 's entry into a crowded but fast-growing market that generated about $ N billion in sales last year \r\n coors is hoping to become one of the first companies to distribute bottled water nationwide \r\n <unk> sold by <unk> group of america a unit of source <unk> s.a. of paris and <unk> sold by a u.s. unit bsn of france are distributed to urban areas nationally but are less available in rural communities \r\n coors with its large <unk> network could <unk> more markets \r\n the company said the water will be called coors rocky mountain <unk> water and will come from the same mountain spring as water used in coors beer \r\n the company said it will sell the water plain and with <unk> and cherry <unk> and will package it in <unk> bottles and N ounce bottles as part of <unk> \r\n the test markets though not specified will be in northern california arizona and colorado some of the hottest <unk> markets \r\n some of america 's biggest trading partners gave a quick <unk> to a u.s. proposal to <unk> world trade and reduce <unk> subsidies \r\n in geneva where world trade talks are being held under the general agreement on tariffs and trade or gatt the european community called the u.s. proposal a step <unk> \r\n and japan 's minister of agriculture <unk> and <unk> told a committee of japan 's parliament that washington 's proposal was <unk> and that tokyo would continue to heavily subsidize its rice farmers \r\n the u.s. in a far-reaching plan submitted to the geneva meeting tuesday proposed curbing price support subsidies within N years and eliminating export subsidies within five years \r\n u.s. officials said the plan was flexible and was intended as a <unk> approach for gradually removing <unk> subsidies \r\n but the ec reacted <unk> arguing that the proposal 's main aim is to destroy the common agricultural policy the ec 's $ N <unk> price support program \r\n the american proposal is not an adequate basis for negotiation the ec said in a statement \r\n ec officials say they are <unk> that the u.s. has set a specific timetable and is insisting on the elimination of export <unk> not just reduction \r\n ec agriculture commissioner ray <unk> said the u.s. plan calls into question the agreement reached by world negotiators last april in geneva seeking substantial <unk> reductions in agricultural support and protection \r\n u.s. deputy trade representative <unk> katz replied that the proposal was entirely consistent with the april accord \r\n he said he was surprised by the ec 's reaction calling it <unk> even <unk> \r\n the u.s. proposal also was criticized by <unk> developing countries who said that the u.s. made no special <unk> for poor nations \r\n while many experts argue that <unk> nations would eventually become <unk> in a free-market system the poorest nations are likely to need help in the meantime \r\n ambassador katz said the u.s. was open to discussing particular problems of developing countries \r\n the u.s. administration said its plan would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when the <unk> goals would be achieved \r\n the u.s. argues that its plan would ease the transition to <unk> agriculture trade by converting certain <unk> barriers into tariffs that together with existing tariffs then would be phased out over N years \r\n but the ec is strongly opposed to converting agricultural supports into tariffs \r\n the new u.s. package also says countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports \r\n it would establish procedures to prevent countries from using health and <unk> rules to <unk> trade <unk> \r\n seeking to <unk> european concerns u.s. agriculture secretary <unk> <unk> said in washington that the new u.s. plan would n't put farmers out of business but would encourage them to grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants \r\n the ec with a population of N million has N million farmers while the u.s. with a population of about N million has only two million farmers \r\n japan 's objections to the u.s. plan center around its desire to stay <unk> in rice a <unk> food even though foreign producers are far more efficient \r\n bell atlantic corp. said it agreed definitively to acquire one of control data corp. 's <unk> businesses \r\n terms of the accord were n't disclosed \r\n control data 's <unk> maintenance unit services products primarily made by digital equipment corp. and international business machines corp \r\n the unit has N customers and according to one analyst had N revenue of about $ N million \r\n under the agreement which had been widely expected bell atlantic would be buying control data 's customer base and its approximately N u.s. maintenance facilities in about N cities \r\n however control data would continue to provide maintenance services for customers of its <unk> product line \r\n the unit represents a small portion of <unk> control data 's overall <unk> business which last year posted sales of about $ N million \r\n earlier this year the company sold a similar unit in europe for about $ N million \r\n lawrence perlman control data 's president and chief operating officer said the maintenance business no longer fits into the company 's strategy to be a data solutions company \r\n thomas <unk> president of bell atlantic 's customer services division said the acquisition would give the company 's <unk> <unk> unit added expertise in the increasingly sophisticated workstation and high-end mainframe technologies \r\n two recent decisions by federal courts cast judges in the odd role of telling authors how they should write history and <unk> \r\n these decisions deserve more attention than they have received from scholars and from journalists as well \r\n russell miller 's bare-faced messiah the true story of l. ron hubbard is a <unk> of the founder of the church of <unk> \r\n mr. hubbard who died in N <unk> the <unk> on his <unk> to his church which licensed them to new era publications a <unk> corporation \r\n in N new era sought a permanent injunction to restrain henry holt & co. from publishing bare-faced messiah on the ground that mr. miller 's quotations from mr. hubbard infringed the <unk> \r\n the publisher argued in response that the fair use statute permits <unk> for purposes such as criticism comment news reporting teaching <unk> or research \r\n district court judge pierre leval denied the injunction on the ground that new era had failed to make its claim within a reasonable time the doctrine lawyers call <unk> \r\n as for the merits judge leval said that mr. miller had written a serious book of responsible historical criticism \r\n <unk> <unk> the judge believed was justified in order to prove points the author had asserted about mr. hubbard <unk> <unk> <unk> and other <unk> <unk> that could not be <unk> demonstrated without use of mr. hubbard 's own words \r\n the <unk> judge leval wrote should not be required simply to express conclusions without defending them by example \r\n in such circumstances <unk> interests <unk> the interests of the copyright owner \r\n but judge leval felt <unk> by an earlier decision of the second circuit court <unk> a <unk> of <unk> salinger to quote from mr. salinger 's personal letters \r\n he distinguished the two cases in salinger judge leval noted the quotations were for the purpose of <unk> the <unk> rather than of proving points about the subject \r\n still the salinger decision created a strong <unk> against fair use of unpublished materials \r\n judge leval <unk> concluded that a few of mr. miller 's quotations from mr. hubbard 's unpublished <unk> because they were not necessary to prove historical points failed the <unk> test and therefore infringed copyright \r\n but the proper remedy judge leval said lay in a suit for damages not in an injunction \r\n the case went on appeal to the second circuit \r\n in a decision in april of this year judge roger <unk> joined by judge frank <unk> agreed on denying the injunction and did not doubt that bare-faced messiah was a serious work but rejected judge leval 's argument that the public interest in <unk> could outweigh the <unk> of copyright \r\n we conclude the two judges wrote that <unk> is the sole bar to the issuance of an injunction \r\n had the suit been filed in time they said bare-faced messiah would have been <unk> \r\n this was too much for james oakes the court 's chief judge \r\n in a powerful separate opinion judge oakes further distinguished the salinger case by pointing out that a living person like mr. salinger had privacy rights that did not apply to a dead man like mr. hubbard \r\n i thought that salinger might by being taken in another <unk> context come back to <unk> us \r\n this case <unk> that concern \r\n decisions by the second circuit itself judge oakes continued had recognized that public interest in the subject matter and the <unk> in particular cases of <unk> quotations are vital components of fair use \r\n and the injunction judges <unk> and <unk> would so readily have granted had new era sued in time \r\n <unk> of the book judge oakes observed would operate as a prior restraint and thus involve the first amendment \r\n moreover and here judge oakes went to the heart of the question responsible <unk> and <unk> constantly use primary sources letters <unk> and <unk> \r\n indeed it would be irresponsible to ignore such sources of information \r\n now scholars in <unk> their responsibility do not claim the right to <unk> every collection of papers that bears upon their topics of investigation \r\n and of course they agree that people can impose restrictions on the use of their papers whether in their own <unk> or as donated or sold to <unk> \r\n but in the bare-faced messiah case the author found most of his material in court records or via the freedom of information act \r\n and when responsible scholars gain legitimate access to unpublished materials copyright should not be permitted to deny them use of quotations that help to establish historical points \r\n judges oakes and leval understand the requirements of historical <unk> \r\n judges <unk> and <unk> do not appear to have a clue \r\n yet at the moment they are the judges who are making the law \r\n as matters stand the salinger ruling torn from context and broadly <unk> is controlling \r\n if an author quotes more than minimal amounts of unpublished <unk> materials as the salinger decision had it he deserves to be <unk> \r\n the courts have not defined minimal amounts but publishers i understand take it to mean about N words \r\n the bare-faced messiah decision strikes a blow against the whole historical enterprise \r\n a second decision handed down in august by the court of appeals for the ninth circuit is another blow against <unk> \r\n <unk> malcolm a professional writer on psychiatric matters wrote a series of articles for the new yorker later published in book form by <unk> under the title in the <unk> <unk> \r\n the articles were largely based on interviews ms. malcolm had taped with jeffrey masson a <unk> who had served as projects director of the <unk> <unk> \r\n mr. masson then brought a libel suit against ms. malcolm the new yorker and <unk> \r\n as a public figure mr. masson had to prove <unk> and as proof of <unk> mr. masson contended that <unk> quotations <unk> to him by ms. malcolm were in fact <unk> \r\n the quotes could not be found on the tapes and the two judges who decided the case for ms. malcolm and her publishers conceded that for the purpose of their decision we assume the quotations were deliberately altered \r\n for all <unk> and most journalists this admission would have been sufficient to condemn the malcolm articles \r\n but judge arthur <unk> joined by judge cynthia <unk> hall took the <unk> position that it is perfectly ok to <unk> quotations so long as a judge finds that the <unk> do not alter <unk> content or are rational <unk> of <unk> remarks \r\n in his <unk> dissent judge alex <unk> observed that when a writer uses <unk> marks in reporting what someone has said the reader assumes that these are the speaker 's precise words or at least his words <unk> of <unk> and you know and <unk> error \r\n while judges have an obligation under the first amendment to <unk> freedom of the press the right to deliberately alter quotations is not in my view a <unk> of a free press \r\n ms. malcolm for example wrote that mr. masson described himself as the greatest analyst who ever lived \r\n no such statement appears on the tapes \r\n the majority cited mr. masson 's remark it 's me alone against the rest of the <unk> world as warrant for the malcolm fabrication \r\n but as judge <unk> noted the context shows that mr. masson 's me alone remark referred not to his alleged <unk> in his profession but to the fact that his position on a particular issue was not shared by anyone else \r\n ms. malcolm had mr. masson describing himself as an intellectual <unk> \r\n again no such statement appears on the tapes \r\n the majority decision contended that the phrase was a rational interpretation of mr. masson 's <unk> of himself as a private asset but a public liability to <unk> <unk> and that in any case it was not <unk> \r\n judge <unk> found the <unk> entirely <unk> and writes that for an academic to refer to himself as an intellectual <unk> is a devastating admission of professional dishonesty \r\n these were only two of a series of <unk> that had in judge <unk> 's words the cumulative effect of making mr. masson appear more arrogant less sensitive <unk> more <unk> and less in touch with reality than he appears from his own statements \r\n as robert <unk> wrote in a review of ms. malcolm 's book mr. masson emerges as a <unk> <unk> and in the end a <unk> fool \r\n but it is not <unk> malcolm who calls him such his own words reveal this psychological profile \r\n we now know that the words were not always his own \r\n there is one <unk> rule of journalism john <unk> has said \r\n the writer must not <unk> \r\n should the green light judges <unk> and hall have given to the fabrication of quotations become standard practice it will notably reduce the value of journalism for <unk> and for citizens \r\n as judge <unk> put it to <unk> the right to deliberately <unk> what someone else has said is to <unk> the right to lie in print \r\n masson has lost his case but the defendants and the profession to which they belong have lost far more \r\n the historical profession will survive these decisions \r\n perhaps in time the supreme court will correct them \r\n but writing history is tough enough without judges <unk> throwing obstacles in the scholar 's path \r\n mr. <unk> is albert <unk> professor of the <unk> at the city university of new york and a winner of <unk> prizes in history and <unk> \r\n <unk> <unk> N years old senior vice president marketing at <unk> entertainment inc. was named president of capitol records inc. a unit of this entertainment concern \r\n mr. <unk> succeeds david <unk> who resigned last month \r\n legal <unk> in america have a way of assuming a <unk> significance far exceeding what is involved in the particular case \r\n they speak volumes about the state of our society at a given moment \r\n it has always been so \r\n in the 1920s a young <unk> john t. <unk> <unk> to be a guinea <unk> in a test case sponsored by the american civil <unk> union to challenge a ban on the teaching of evolution imposed by the tennessee legislature \r\n the result was a <unk> trial <unk> <unk> cultural conflicts in american life between the smart set whose spokesman was <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> whom <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> \r\n few now recall the actual outcome <unk> was convicted and fined $ N and his conviction was reversed on appeal because the fine was excessive under tennessee law \r\n so it was with the <unk> case a generation later when <unk> <unk> became a <unk> rod for the <unk> of the cold war and <unk> attitudes toward the new deal he had served \r\n his trials aroused public <unk> out of all proportion to the rather <unk> secrets he allegedly had passed to soviet intelligence \r\n and so it seems to be with the case of elizabeth morgan the washington d.c. plastic surgeon jailed in a child custody case for refusing to reveal the <unk> of her daughter \r\n dr. morgan has just emerged from the d.c. jail after more than two years ' <unk> for <unk> of court a <unk> to her many supporters \r\n to the rest of us the case is a <unk> \r\n it is what lawyers call fact intensive \r\n it presents no great issue of legal principle no <unk> question of family law or the law of <unk> \r\n instead it turns on the disputed and <unk> facts of who did what to whom \r\n it is difficult if not impossible for anyone who has not <unk> over the thousands of pages of court <unk> and <unk> to have a <unk> opinion on the underlying merits of the controversy \r\n certainly i do not \r\n so we must look elsewhere for an explanation of the unusual power this case has <unk> over the minds of many not just in washington but elsewhere in the country and even the world \r\n i suggest that three themes have come together in the strange case of dr. morgan \r\n the first is that it represents an intense battle in what james <unk> used to <unk> as the war between the <unk> \r\n but although <unk> did so gently and <unk> many of dr. morgan 's supporters have taken <unk> 's <unk> title the male animal quite literally \r\n the <unk> of the <unk> aroused by the case <unk> to its <unk> importance in the war that <unk> accepted as an <unk> part of the human condition \r\n a second theme is the <unk> of social class and race in the public reaction to the morgan case \r\n dr. morgan is a highly educated white professional who attended some of the best schools \r\n as members of the black <unk> in congress asked during the debate on the legislation that freed dr. morgan does anyone seriously believe that if she were an <unk> black <unk> woman congress would have rushed to pass a private relief bill <unk> her \r\n or that the president would have <unk> to sign the bill out of <unk> for her plight \r\n to ask those questions is to answer them \r\n finally the case of dr. morgan gave congress an opportunity to act with <unk> <unk> and to engage in one of its favorite <unk> <unk> the district of columbia government \r\n the local government is <unk> in the eyes of many residents for a variety of reasons and congressmen read the same newspapers and watch the same tv <unk> as other people in the area do \r\n <unk> the d.c. government is <unk> for members of congress who do not have to answer to their own constituents for it \r\n congress is <unk> from acting on such great issues of the day as the federal budget deficit \r\n yet a bill tailored to the interests of a single individual passed congress with almost <unk> speed before the judicial process had run its course and indeed while the morgan case was awaiting a ruling by the appellate court \r\n the morgan case thus tells us much more about the current state of sex class race and politics in our society than it does about the facts of dr. morgan 's particular situation \r\n it may stand as a <unk> for how wide and deep the divisions in that society continue to be however we try to deny their existence \r\n mr. <unk> is a lawyer in washington <unk> \r\n the national aeronautics and space administration said it awarded general dynamics corp. a $ N

N mr. breeden found himself <unk> around the sixth floor of the sec from his desk where the new york stock exchange was on an open line to his assistant 's office where the commodity futures trading commission was connected to a third room where a computer monitored market moves \r\n with other anxious calls pouring in he recalls i 'd either have to <unk> the new york stock exchange or go out to the secretary 's desk \r\n it wo n't happen again \r\n now there are more lines connected to the chairman 's office and the <unk> computer has been moved next to his desk \r\n it 's all part of a new command center \r\n the changes in the office <unk> illustrate mr. breeden 's stance as the nation 's top securities regulator \r\n like his predecessor david <unk> he was faced with a crisis in the stock markets soon after coming into office \r\n but unlike mr. <unk> who during the N crash damaged himself by saying rather <unk> that the markets might be closed mr. breeden is turning the market drop to his own advantage using it to further his agenda for the sec \r\n in an interview and in congressional testimony he repeatedly points to the recent 190-point plunge in the dow jones industrial average the second-largest ever as evidence of the need for congress to give the sec the ability to better monitor leveraged buy-out loan activity by brokerage firms and to track big trades in the market \r\n a veteran of another financial crisis the savings-and-loan bailout mr. breeden wants to have the sec regulate securities issued by banks and s&ls \r\n more broadly he wants to modernize regulation by eliminating barriers between commercial and investment banking and by helping u.s. financial firms compete in the global market \r\n he believes the tax code encourages the use of debt instead of stock and may fuel leveraged buy-outs an area the sec does n't regulate directly but one where it <unk> influence both on wall street and in congress \r\n also unlike mr. <unk> mr. breeden appears to be in a position to get somewhere with his agenda \r\n as a former white house aide who worked closely with congress he is <unk> in the ways of washington \r\n what 's more the coming months likely will offer him the opportunity to obtain his own majority on the <unk> commission enabling him to avoid the <unk> that frustrated his predecessor \r\n but mr. breeden a <unk> securities lawyer has <unk> some of the <unk> issues facing the financial markets \r\n for instance he has n't stated a clear position on high-risk high-yield junk bonds an area of growing concern as turmoil in the junk market <unk> over into stocks \r\n he may be waiting to see the results of several pending sec studies of junk market liquidity and disclosure rules \r\n he also has kept a close wrap on the names of people under consideration for the crucial post of enforcement director at the commission a job vacant since the summer \r\n mr. breeden 's selection will be <unk> as an important signal about the strength of his commitment to continuing the sec 's <unk> pursuit of insider trading and market manipulation on wall street \r\n congress seems likely to let the new chairman have his way for a while \r\n members of the senate banking committee know mr. breeden from working on the <unk> bill and the relationship generally remains warm \r\n indeed during mr. breeden 's confirmation hearing last month senators asked him to introduce his children three separate times more often than they asked about his <unk> for the job \r\n these days mr. breeden is winning <unk> in washington and on wall street for his <unk> role in monitoring the friday-the-13th market plunge and the following monday 's <unk> morning session \r\n as a regulator charged with restoring investor confidence mr. breeden avoided making <unk> comments and worked to gather information critical to wall street and to other government agencies \r\n not everyone has jumped on the breeden <unk> however \r\n some in washington contend that it 's too soon to tell whether mr. breeden will help or <unk> the sec \r\n i do n't think this was a real test says one congressional aide \r\n it was a fairly <unk> weekend but my sense is if you had n't had richard breeden there it would n't have made much of a difference \r\n for some at the sec an agency that <unk> its independence mr. breeden may be too much of a washington insider \r\n they note that he has <unk> his office with five photos of george bush one of them featuring the first dog <unk> \r\n they worry that mr. breeden also will roll over when told to do so by the white house \r\n but mr. breeden already has shown an eagerness to run the sec his way \r\n during the monday market rebound a new york exchange spokesman told cable news network viewers that the industrial average had turned down N points \r\n stunned mr. breeden turned to his <unk> computer which by then was next to his desk \r\n it showed the <unk> up N points \r\n sec staffers soon determined that a widely watched stock-market service quotron had <unk> the industrial average \r\n mr. breeden instructed sec staffers to inform the network that it was airing the wrong number \r\n it was the plunge that did n't happen he says \r\n mr. breeden also is trying to use a far more catastrophic event the california earthquake to move another rule change past congress \r\n that disaster closed the pacific stock exchange 's stock <unk> operation forcing those options to be switched to other exchanges temporarily \r\n though <unk> to most investors the question of whether to list options on more than one exchange has aroused much interest in congress mainly because regional exchanges fear the change could bankrupt them \r\n congressmen raised the issue yesterday at a hearing \r\n mr. breeden not missing a chance to press his agenda cited the earthquake \r\n that event he contended simply shows the <unk> of having listings on only one exchange \r\n in a corner of

investment in u.s. carriers now says the bill would further <unk> the jittery capital markets \r\n texas rep. steve bartlett who has N american airlines workers in his district says the bill is good politics but bad law \r\n it is ironic that at a time when america 's partial airline deregulation is being <unk> by governments from new zealand to ethiopia so many in congress favor an <unk> program for airlines that would be more appropriate for the soviet airline aeroflot \r\n federal reserve chairman alan greenspan told congress that the fed can wipe out inflation without causing a recession but he said doing so will <unk> some short-term pain and will require reducing the federal deficit sharply \r\n mr. greenspan said he and other fed governors <unk> a bill by rep. stephen neal d. n.c. that would require the fed to pursue policies aimed at eliminating inflation within five years \r\n such a deadline is <unk> but it would have costs mr. greenspan told rep. neal 's monetary policy subcommittee \r\n the fed chief opposed a bill introduced by <unk> lee hamilton d. ind. and <unk> <unk> d. <unk> that among other things would require the fed to disclose all monetary policy moves immediately and increase outside scrutiny of the fed \r\n in responding to questions mr. greenspan played down reports of tension between the fed and the treasury over exchange-rate policy \r\n what seem to be interpreted as great conflicts are relatively minor issues of tactics he said \r\n he did n't elaborate \r\n but the fed is n't enthusiastic about treasury efforts to bring down the value of the dollar through intervention in foreign-exchange markets and the treasury is frustrated at the fed 's reluctance to cut interest rates to pull down the dollar 's value \r\n mr. greenspan said the inflation rate currently about N N N could be brought down to levels which are close to zero without putting the economy into a recession but i do suspect that there might be some modest loss of economic output \r\n in other words economic growth would be lower and unemployment would be higher for a few years \r\n but mr. greenspan who has repeatedly said the fed 's goal is to reduce inflation added that whatever losses are incurred in the pursuing of price stability would surely be more than made up in increased output thereafter \r\n he warned that fed efforts to <unk> inflation would fail and could produce a major financial crunch unless they are accompanied by a significant reduction in the federal deficit which causes the government to borrow heavily \r\n rep. neal 's bill originally called on the fed to reduce the inflation rate by one percentage point a year for five years and to maintain a zero inflation rate thereafter \r\n he altered the <unk> to win mr. greenspan 's endorsement \r\n even so his bill is given little chance of passage \r\n <unk> hamilton and <unk> also have altered their bill dropping a proposal to add the treasury secretary to the <unk> fed committee that makes monetary policy \r\n instead the bill simply calls for <unk> meetings between the committee and top administration officials \r\n even that met with mr. greenspan 's <unk> because it might subject the fed to a more intensely political perspective and could risk <unk> monetary policy away from long-term strategic goals \r\n while each of the <unk> proposals represents only a small step together they would erode the fed 's independence mr. greenspan said \r\n mr. greenspan also said that although he favors cutting capital-gains taxes as sound economic policy he would oppose such a move if it would undo the political compromise <unk> in the tax reform act of N and result in higher marginal income tax rates \r\n sears roebuck & co. signed a contract with bob vila the former host of the popular public television program this old house to star in a half-hour home improvement show sponsored by the giant retailer \r\n the <unk> show slated to start airing by june N marks sears 's entry into the <unk> market of home repair television programs and could bolster sales of its home improvement products \r\n in recent months sales of home improvement items have sagged along with sales of other big ticket durable goods \r\n the show also signals mr. vila 's return as a television celebrity \r\n earlier this year public television station <unk> in boston fired mr. vila after a sponsor <unk> some of his numerous commercial <unk> \r\n with mr. vila as host this old house became one of the public broadcasting service 's top N programs airing weekly on about N of the network 's stations and seen by an average of N million viewers \r\n but home <unk> inc. an atlanta-based home center chain <unk> when mr. vila started doing commercial <unk> for <unk> home centers a new jersey building supply company that competes with home <unk> in some markets \r\n i 'm <unk> about the change said mr. vila whose new syndicated program is called home again with bob vila \r\n in an interview mr. vila criticized his old show which is continuing with a new host \r\n public tv is in fantasy land he said \r\n last season we did a story that involved spending $ N in converting a <unk> house into a bed and break\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/hell.txt.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document,

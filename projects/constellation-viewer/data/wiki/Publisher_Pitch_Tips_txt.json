Only important mechanics.\r\n\tExplain what the player does during gameplay\r\n\tDon't use realism as a way to excuse elements of design (in pitch)\r\n\tMake note of the obstacles. e.g. convincing AI will be challenging\r\n\tPay for a few high quality concept art pieces to flesh out the world\r\n\tMake sure publisher can tell what's placeholder and what's not\r\n\tObvious placeholders are better than bad art that looks final\r\n\tDon't polish art assets first. Gameplay is the most important\r\n\tDon't let overshadow the importance of game programming in prototype\r\n\tShowcase good dialogue, or no dialogue at all (no demo dialogue)\r\n\tFind publishers that have funded similar work\r\n\tNever go into a pitch without an idea of scope\r\n\tHow much money and time will it take to finish?\r\n\tHow many hours of gameplay?\r\n\tHow many levels?\r\n\tHow many lines of dialogue?\r\n\tHow many characters?\r\n\tHave a roadmap for how you're going to hire people. Have lead ideas.\r\n\tMake sure your business plan is realistic. 500,000 sales at release.\r\n\tAnswer questions while pitching\r\n\tBring all necessary equipment to showcase product \r\n\r\nProduce a 'vertical slice' (first playable, proof of concept, minimum viable product)\r\n\tnot a full game\r\n\tplayer experience focus\r\n\tmajor systems\r\n\tkey features\r\n\trepresentative of final quality\r\n\r\n\tHire concept team\r\n\tSimulate gameplay\r\n\tBlock out levels\r\n\tIgnore technology limitations\r\n\tQuestioned everything\r\n\tSet project goals\r\n\r\n\tStart with cinematic camera\r\n\tSet up gameplay view\r\n\tEstablish mood/tone - give viewer context\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/Publisher_Pitch_Tips.txt.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, character-design, dialogue, story, quest, feature, gameplay, mechanic\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.069Z",

THE PITCH\n--------------------\nDodec: Beyond Our Home is a:\n- Hard science fiction\n- Adventure, narrative-exploration\n- Vibrant verdant vertical vistas\n- In a future 500,000 years removed from our own\n- The super-earth world of Chione is our new home\n- We left the earth pristine and perfect for new life\n\nWelcome to a world of sprawling arcologies, towering self-contained cities \nthat provide everything their inhabitants need within their walls. Lifts, \nplatforms, walkways, vistas, pathways, and bridges connect the different \nlevels and sections of these massive structures. The 'hand-held high scaler' \ntechnology is abundant, set to the side of buildings for rapid upwards \nmobility.\n\nAs you explore these arcologies, you'll encounter a variety of machines that \nmaintain them and make life easier for their inhabitants. These machines are \ndesigned to be simple yet efficient, relying on both technology and humane \ntradition to create innovative and sustainable solutions.\n\nThe game encourages players to explore this optimistic vision of humanity's \nfuture, where buildings are connected by an intricate system of pathways, \nwalkways, and bridges. The arcologies are alive with activity and movement, \nreflecting the game's central themes of preserving history and making the \nworld a better place through beneficent actions and deeds that value other \npeople.\n\n2.

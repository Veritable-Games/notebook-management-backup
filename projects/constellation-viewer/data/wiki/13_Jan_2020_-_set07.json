companies.\nWe need more competition space because right now there is a dominant infrastructure in cables.\nRight, you're putting this infrastructure for the internet, but that's where Elon satellites come in.\nWith this sort of infrastructure, you don't need satellites of the world.\nYou don't need these unruly tethers, these cables, these, am I?\nOkay.\nI'll know the...\nI mean, it's either it wants better a satellite network or a network of stationary satellites.\nYou can't make stationary satellites.\nYou can.\nYou can.\nYou can.\nYou can.\n\n\n====== REC110.txt ======\nI am now in my 11th note.\n110th.\nChrist.\n\n\n====== REC111.txt ======\nNot everything I see is important. Nothing is actually, but you know, relative to me,\nrelative to my own acquisition of statements. I can't expect the brain to remember everything,\nso I've record a lot of it. If I could just... I can have to. I don't want to, why am I not\ninspired to get up and go and do it? Because that's my name, and I don't need this right now,\nI need... I am building this space. All these videos are accumulated. I mind this. I'm sure\nthere's a piece I've lost. Information that I could use later, really. Like I recall something about\nmaking music, or I particularly did a rhythm, but I can't. I can't get back to it. It's gone.\nBecause the brain has retained everything from months and months and months. It's unfortunate,\nbut I'm fine. It's not a computer.\n\n\n====== REC112.txt ======\nso I got this at a lower quarter.\n\n\n====== REC113.txt ======\nWhat if you littered your best notes throughout the space?\nNot a foldable per se, but...\n...interesting a lot of them.\nWhat if you find a character?\nSomeone's sitting there talking to himself?\nLike I do.\nAnd that important story.\nI just want to put a ramblings in the game.\nIt does suck this requires terrible, but...\n...I think that's fun.\n\n\n====== REC114.txt ======\nSo, Polos Larry, I'm obsessed with this really interesting thing, it's a miniaturization.\nI suppose it's the most apt way you can describe this space.\nIt's more of...\nSo, imagine you have atoms, you have cells, you have bodies, all the components that make up these larger structures,\nthey're smaller structures, you break it down, and you find that everything in the world,\nall there is cost effect, it's deterministic, and...\nAs long as I persist, I will continue to do things, I cannot do things.\nI'm just not the better, I can reduce the time I spend, not doing anything.\nI can't engage with these anymore, I'm so bored.\nThere's some good shows, but I am, but it's...\nI've got to use TV for light learning, put on a good number of game-deferlated episodes,\ngame-deferlated, you've got the...\nI just sit there and take notes and listen.\nYeah, that'd be good.\nI can learn things.\n\n\n====== REC115.txt ======\nto this work. Oh man, I haven't bought this much yet. Letters didn't know, fuck.\n\n\n====== REC116.txt ======\nThe quicks to discern when there is something is good or bad, but be sure to listen to the entire thing.\nYou don't have to record it, if it's not important.\n\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/13_Jan_2020_-_set07.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, character-design, dialogue, item, weapon, story, quest, feature, gameplay, mechanic, fix\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.027Z",

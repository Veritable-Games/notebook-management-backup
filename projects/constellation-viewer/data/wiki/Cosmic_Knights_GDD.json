The players use a varied selection of weapons and abilities to punch their way through alien skeleton territory and close the Fractures they pour from. Players can customize their knight’s armor with paint, cloth, and symbols. \nMechanics\nPlayer\nHealth\nThe Knights health is visually represented by a neon health bar that travels down their spine. The bar flashes when health is below 40% and increases in intensity the lower the percentage. Health bar flashes when low. Color is chosen by player.\nEnergy\nCrystals are used for both ammo and health. The total amount is represented by a bar on the player's back. To form ammo, the player must drain liquified crystals from that 'health' bar by pressing R. They can refill it by mining crystals that are scattered all over the map. Mining is done by shooting the crystals with the mining pistol.\nWhen the player is hit by an enemy, they flash the color of crystals and lose health.\nReviving\nWhen a player revives someone else, 1/4th of their remaining crystals are given to that revived knight.\nWeapons\nGale – Short range weapon that propels a massive gust of air that knocks back enemies but does not kill them. It has an unlimited ammo supply but is slow to reload. Reloading is done by winding a mechanism that adds to an energy pool. It can be wound up at any point. The weapon is held like a small shield and resembles one too. The Gale can be used to charge through swarms and make a path. Charging takes crystal energy.\nGlesum – Shoots crystal grenades that detonate on impact, solidifying any enemies in its radius in a crystalline shell for a long period of time. It has a secondary fire that turns these same grenades into land mines that are great for setting traps. It looks like a crossbow.\nBestiolae – This weapon has the most plentiful ammo capacity and will liquefy any bone it hits. The weapon’s magma can also be applied to surfaces, potentially melting the legs or arms of any enemy it touches. It doesn’t have a very long range though.\nTendril – A flail-like weapon with a smooth metal sphere at the tip, and lengthy conductive cord that curls up when not in use. Its primary fire mode will electrify an enemy it hits, that charge spreads to nearby enemies, and ruptures their skulls. The weapon’s secondary fire mode swings the weapon 360 degrees and stuns all of the enemies it hits for a brief period.\nGreatgun – A large, powerful weapon that can break through the rib cages of multiple enemies. It’s precise, so the weapon is great for long distances. The weapon resembles a great sword and can be used as a melee weapon when the player isn’t aiming down the sights. When not aimed, the player holds it like a sword over their shoulder and aims it like a gun when they aim down sights. Has a projectile that returns to the gun every time it shoots; colliding with targets to and from the maximum range. Shots cost energy.\nMining Pistol – A sidearm that has infinite ammo, it grapples into crystals and pulls them out of walls. It can also be used to kill enemies, but it’s not good at crowd control as it only hits one target at a time.\nWeapon that knocks enemies back, has charge attack\nWeapon that freezes enemies in place, can set mines\nWeapon that chain stuns enemies it hits, has 360 attack\nWeapon that melts enemies, can be applied to surfaces\nWeapon that breaks nearby enemies, shoots long range\nAbilities\nDisrupt – Emit a sound that stuns all skeletons for a short period of time.\nKindle – Destroy all nearby skeletons within 1 and 2 range of player.\nTurn – Converts half of all nearby skeletons into permanent allies until capacity is reached.\nHaste – Speeds up spawned skeleton movement but drastically reduces their health. \nUnite – Splits all available health and ammunition evenly between Knights.\nCustomization\nA knight can choose their Helmet, Torso, Arms, Legs, armor material, and apply other cosmetics.\nUnlocks\nEvery cosmetic in the game is earned. No purchase options. Learn from the Halo unlock system.\nPainting\n\nEnemies\nEnemies will 'regroup' every couple of minutes to prevent the combat from getting dull and give players an opportunity to collect crystals and restore ammo.\nStapes\nThe basic enemy type. A white-colored skeleton with destructible bones. Spawns by default. \nTendon\nA fast, small skeleton with a quick attack. Spawns when the Knights have captured 4/7 Fractures. It lacks rib bones and a jaw and has a thin, torn layer of muscular tissue around its skeleton. Tendons attack from the most exposed angle of all players and can hide within the horde. They make noises to denote their presence and are less affected by knock back attacks as they can dig their claws into the ground.\nMarrow\nAn enormous, intimidating skeleton with increased bone resilience and harder hits. Spawns when 6/7 fractures have been taken by the enemy team. The Marrow doesn’t have a skull or hands and can be easily spotted in a horde due to its size. The Marrow can kick players away from their team if it gets too close.\nLevels & HUB\nEach map is littered with traps, and devices that affect the flow of the level. For example, a machine that will crush or maim skeletons if triggered. Or a toggleable blockade that redirects the flow of enemies for a short period of time.\nLevels must always be illuminated and avoid excessively dark colors. As the enemies are mostly melee focused, keep levels claustrophobic and tight, but provide enough space for enemies and allies to move through. Every level brings a new theme, a new location, and a new boss. Things like variants on enemy skins, unique music, unique boss VO, and a map that brings the whole package together in a cohesive manner. \nLinear levels with strategic points (e.g. good areas to defend against incoming enemies) and multiple variations in the route leading to the final Fracture. crystals should ideally be found in random locations and special enemy spawns should be random too\nFractures & Fracture Seals\nFractures are where enemies spawn from, and they’re all scattered within a short radius of their respective Seals. There are 7 Fracture Seals per map, and it’s the Knight’s job to find and close all Fractures using these devices. When they interact with one, the ground will be highlighted by a purple light. (the same color as the crystals) and will expand outwards to surround the surface of all nearby Fracture points. The difficulty varies depending on the structure of the level and placement/density of those Fractures. The process of sealing requires that one player stand on the elevated button podium without moving until all Fractures are sealed. (Effectively a timer) The other three players must defend them. Completing a Fracture Seal is indicated by audio cues and visual effects.\nDifficulties\n\t* Ordinary (Casual) – Enemies have slightly less health, fewer numbers, and specials spawn infrequently.\n\t* Noble (Normal) – Enemies have normal health, average numbers, and specials spawn predictably.\n\t* Exalted (Hard) – Enemies have more health, greater numbers, and specials spawn more often.\n“One of you must stand on the Fracture Seal. Your armor will give it power.”\nMusic & Sound\nWords\nControls & Options\nControls\nTAB outlines enemies like in Left 4 Dead. \nQ Launches a beacon from the nearest open Fracture location. It’s large enough to see from across the map. But there’s no navigation assistant or mini-map. The players must explore to find it.\nHolding R converts crystals into ammo. There is no reload function. Only refill.\nE interacts with the Fracture Seal. It highlights terrain it can seal and slowly grows outward towards the Fractures. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBbmmQfufmY\nCamera\nMoving or aiming locks the camera to the character's back. Standing still lets the camera freely rotate around the player. Reloading unlocks the camera's horizontal rotation. Shooting from the hip locks the camera's horizontal rotation, but it will unlock after a few seconds of not firing. Aiming down the sights will lock the camera's horizontal rotation until aim is let go.\nCheat Codes\n\nDeveloper Tips\nEnemy Skeleton models should be 5,000 to 10,000 polygons. Try to avoid normal maps to improve performance.\nThe players’ Knight models should be 15,000 to 30,000 polygons. \nuse rigid bodies for enemies, not character controllers\nBuilding a prototype without art\nUse the default capsules as player and enemy objects. Utilize color, sound, and rotation to represent states. Weapons can be represented by rectangles. Utilize Crowd Behavior Scripts to create enemy hordes.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxX9sGhsbks\ncreate game systems\n- health/ammo\n- health pickup\n- ammo conversion\n- enemy spawn\n- enemy die\n- enemy waves\n- enemy attack\n- fracture close system\nCreate target gameplay footage when you pitch the game to publishers and provide a prototype that resembles the important parts of that footage.\nQuestions\n\t* 4, 5, or 6 weapons? \n\t* 4 or 6 players? \n\t* Is the crossbow really viable? Other weapons have a similar function. Be sure every weapon is unique.\n\t* Player CoD zombies, L4D, and KF. Observe enemy movement. Is basic pathfinding enough?\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/Cosmic_Knights_GDD.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, character-design, weapon, location, quest, gameplay, mechanic\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.052Z",

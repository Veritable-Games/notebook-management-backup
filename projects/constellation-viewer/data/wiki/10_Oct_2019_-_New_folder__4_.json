Is it a shape? Is it a glyph?\nThey don't take a Hadron.\nSo it's like a...\nSo is it physical?\nIt's a physical device.\nThey've pulled the structure like a key.\nSo is he finding pieces or the whole thing?\nHe's finding there are twelve Dota-Kedron.\nOkay, so they have...\nDo they know what the pieces look like?\nThey are...\nKind of like...\nThey know there are twelve...\nThey say there are twelve missing.\nThere are a lot of them.\nLike a lot, a lot.\nOkay, so it's the giant piece.\nIt's...\nMaybe not a giant piece.\nImagine like the door itself.\nHave you played Assassin's Creed Legends?\nHmm...\nI have played a badminton shit.\nSo...\nIt's a cutscene only about the middle part of the game.\nThey have an artifact.\nEach member has a piece and the artifact will walk to every piece is placed.\nIt's how they know each other from face.\nThey all meet and each person has the place to piece of this artifact.\nIf not all pieces of the artifact are there, the device will activate.\nHuh.\nBut when every piece is assembled, the device activates.\nSo one thing is that these pieces are also sources of energy.\nThey're like...\nThey're animus pieces.\nOkay, animus pieces.\nThat might be good.\nSo, do you know the theory of animus?\nHmm.\nSo before we understood about consciousness,\na doctor theorized that those are so animus.\nThey kept your blood liquid, you know, your whole pumping,\nthe brain, the body, from that, not rotting.\nHe believed that even after death, this animus could remain involved.\nSo, like they thought it was sold pretty much?\nYeah, but they got more of a literal sense.\nYeah, but it got wolfed, super-stitioned.\nSo, at the time there was a disease called consumption,\nwhich we now know to probably be tuberculosis,\nand some other disease called the other.\nBecause people were dying from this disease,\none and four people initially were dying from this disease.\nThere was a family.\nHis wife was dying, his daughter had died, his son had it,\nand his elder daughter had died.\nThe village made him exhume,\nhis youngest oldest body,\ncut out a horde and live them,\nborn it in a concoction,\nand feed it to the sick some.\nBecause they believed that the animus,\nif it resides in the horde,\nsometimes becomes corrupted and trapped in the body,\nand it feeds off the blood.\nI mean, that's the allegoral belief that some of the people have.\nThis is, no, no, it's 80's synonymous,\nor whatever, but in reality it's...\nNo, this is a real thing that happened in New England.\nI gotcha.\nI mean, they called the actual ritual...\nNo, this wasn't a call.\nOr the group people that believed there was...\nThis was just some weird warping of the force\nto the American Empire.\nOh.\nThat's pretty cool.\nOh, yeah, okay.\nBefore I forget.\nJust take note.\nOkay.\n\n\n====== REC004.txt ======\nOkay, so the, there are an uncertain number of Dota Geedrens found on the structure.\nThey're separated over distance. They've collected quite a few of them,\nbecause the city's only gone so far, and people want to climb so high.\nAnd drones can only go so high without losing air pressure, because the structure is so large.\nSo, what do you ask?\nDo they know the name, or is it not a name that they have figured out yet?\nLet's say the scientists, people who are not superstitious, they call them the Dota Geedrens.\nSo, therefore, they are Dota Geedrens.\nI just want to know the name, because that was the tone of the shape.\nBecause if they know the name of the shape, they know what it looks like.\nThat's how they're trying to figure out the level of understanding of what they're building.\nThe final shape is what are they still collecting pieces?\nOh no, no, they're multiple.\nOh, so they're multiple Dota Geedrens.\nThere are hundreds of thousands, maybe millions.\nSo, it's like they're scattered along the surface of the structure.\nAnd civilization sometimes buries them with their machines.\nI mean, usually they're excavated, usually they're found.\nBut sometimes there'll be a few that are still behind all the concrete and development that's been...\nYeah, but then there's more above them. They're of high high up.\nAnd so, people don't know what they do, but they know that they use for power.\nSo, they take these Dota Geedrens and use them for energy.\nIt's one of these things.\nThey've been there 200 years.\nThey haven't had to replace them yet.\nYou know, it's like they're so dense with energy.\nWell, as far as they know.\nBut being mathematics is what it is.\nMaybe the one that's been being studied into the incident might be that these godex, they're starting to fade.\nA few of them are.\nThe ones that have been in use for longer.\nBut I guess that you can be...\nI mean, hypothetically, hypothetically, they could.\nBut in say the rest of this reality, they could have hundreds of thousands.\nI mean, millions of years of energy.\nSo, the Dota Geedrens that don't find in some form of compressed energy?\nThey're matter.\nE equals empty squared.\nIt matter is equal to energy, and energy is equal to matter.\nIf you condense it.\nAnd it's like a...\nYou can... hypothetically, you can convert energy to matter,\nbut you need more energy to put into it to force it in the matter.\nOkay, after I've finished with the scientists, I've been already about to know it's forced to put it.\nOkay, I'm going to leave it there for now.\nSo, and that's why I'm obviously going to do the Dota Geedrens.\nHarvesting the Dota Geedrens?\nYou said that they collect them, correct?\nWell, they're cubic lecturers.\nYeah, I'm sure.\nI'm still going to collect them for like the scientists.\nOh, yeah.\nAbsolutely.\nI think that'd be an interesting thing.\nThat'd be an interesting thing.\nOkay, so you're saying this scientist could be a collector.\nHe's part of the...\nMaybe not a collector, but he's already an experiment on them.\nAnd he needs Dota Geedrens.\nAnd he's supposed to climb to the tower,\nwhether it's not really people gathering from it,\nbecause it's too high.\nBecause he's not the fresh undisturbed Dota Geedrens there.\nSo, he's an adventure.\nHe's going out there.\nHe's really...\nHe's hiring another person.\nOh, okay.\nSo, he's...\nOh, I see.\nSo, he's talking about the experience that this adventure going out there,\nand exploring.\nYeah, he's reading data notes.\nOh.\nA laptop of going over this.\nIt's a good idea.\nIt's perfect form form format.\nOkay.\nAnd I can announce the next character in his audience,\nto do CC Explosion.\nImagine it being a literal form.\nYou have avatars.\nYou have user names.\nYou have people that are bouncing back to forth in conversation.\nThere's more characters, more people interacting.\nWell, because he said they're very social.\nSo, I was imagining that they probably have like a real movie\nthat is going on.\nAnd it's just communications room.\nWell, I mean...\nIn VR, sure.\nMaybe...\nYou see...\nWhat is that show?\nWhat is that show?\nWhat is that?\nThe one of the guy he got revived,\nthe consciousness is stored in the desk in the back.\nThe desk in the neck.\nOh, yeah.\nI just...\nI fucking watched that.\nDo you know the viola cafes?\nYeah.\nI was thinking something similar to that,\nbecause he said they're very social.\nYou can think of where they could be in their houses\nand still gather on social areas using that.\nAnd let's say not all people do that.\nLet's say, like, it's still...\nLet's say...\nBecause these spaces are designed to be social,\na lot of people don't have enough energy,\nhave enough motivation about their explorer in person.\nBut there's a subject in the community that's, you know,\nI'm good for today.\nI'm going to chill.\nI was looking for like long-range communication.\nBut I mean, like, imagine...\nIt is long-range communication,\nbut it's hoached by androids.\nOoh.\nImagine that.\nImagine they...\nYeah, yeah, exactly.\nThat's the purpose for that.\nYep.\nThe AI.\nYou play is...\nAI.\nAI.\nAI.\nYou play is one of the androids.\nBut you're also an AI, which means you're everywhere once.\nYou know, it's like...\nYou play...\nYou play is these hologram people.\nPeople have been...\nI mean, they're not...\nAt the moment, they don't feel like going out.\nAt the moment, they don't feel like...\nYou miss portions of their lives,\nbecause they don't always choose to live with them.\nDid you see that movie of 3-Slow?\nIt's a modeling androids.\nHmm.\nIt was an interesting concept.\nPeople didn't know how to sign and send a road\nand how to...\nAndroids and what they did is they would lay in this bed.\nAnd they would use this androids\nto interact with the world.\nAnd that was how the world walked.\nLike, literally everyone is doing it in their cops.\nIt was how to sign and function.\nAlmost everyone was androids.\nAnd...\nThose are dudes that is murdering people.\nSo the androids have safe codes, both in.\nSo the user can't come to home.\nAnd he's...\nSomeone's using a weapon that overrides that safe code and kills you.\nOkay, they're like laborer then.\nKind of.\nBut they're really strippy,\nbecause it exposed the question of...\nIs it the same if we interact through that way,\nor is face-to-face communication?\nWell, I'd say there are features missing.\nI mean, unless the neural brain interface is so incredible\nthat it can give all of a sensory perception.\nPeople are so addicted to that.\nThey do that and go out physically.\nAnd you could tweak it.\nYeah, you're right.\nBut is that necessarily...\nIs that necessarily the worst thing, though?\nI think that people are pretty pessimistic,\nbut I think that...\nI don't think I have a problem.\nIf you are still yourself through and through,\nyou're just being...\nYou have like a latency joined to this being,\nand it's not too big of a deal.\nBut at the same time, it's like,\nyou feel controlling.\nYou feel like you're helping out there.\nYou know, kind of helping be sociable,\nhelping you be, you know,\nthrough your life.\nHave you seen the movie Her?\nHer is a good reference.\nWe're fucking Phoenix.\nSo it's not as bad as it could be.\nI think that's a wonderful notion of Utopia.\nAnyway, let's play some games.\n\n\n====== REC005.txt ======\nThe AEI can also be used as a mediator in governing issues, not a dictator, but one to facilitate\ncommunication between governing parties.\n\n\n====== REC006.txt ======\nHe was in the middle of the night, maybe on a companion I met, he was in that library that I knew, and he was really distressed with hate for what he enforced.\nBecause I killed a lot of his friends and all of his students. He was like, why didn't you warn us?\nI actually had to explain myself to him.\nI don't know when we start that.\n\n\n====== REC007.txt ======\nTurns out in the TV all these wonderful choices, you get to play how you want, and it shows you and reminds you of what's happening as a result of that.\n\n\n====== REC008.txt ======\nSo I'm thinking imagine you're living this world around. You're living huge. You're inhabiting these structures as people living in the time period of the Sarah.\nDeath really is an issue. There's not a lot of crime. They're kind of just relaxed to be who you are in the space you're in, so it's pretty much you built here.\nThere's still an interpersonal conflict, but not as much as most people would expect. It's meant to be unifying as opposed to dividing people.\nThere's no cars. There's no streets. There's walkways. No spaces. Interconnected areas with close-knit communities.\nThey use simple lights. They use light and traffic. Oh no, there's no lights at all.\nThere are bikes. If there's enough room, the larger streets can use bikes.\nThat's probably one of the best bikes from have to go away just because it's sci-fi. I think bikes are pretty adequate means of getting transportation. It's like any human tool, those things never vanish entirely.\nYou have your bicycles, right? You could be electric, you could be whatever they use. Some of you dodex, you can have fun. That's a long tangent.\nOkay, let me try it.\n\n\n====== REC010.txt ======\nHe would carry tools. I don't think he'd carry weapons.\nThat's why I wanted to ask if they filled a social needs case weapons.\nBecause if they're on the planet and they believe that there's no external threat, then they won't carry weapons.\nIt'll be more likely to just carry tools. The scientists won't fill a need to have anything weaponized\nand all the research will be focused probably on thinking about this.\nTerrorists that are next to them, they walk and like, they're the huge ones.\nSo what I'm trying to figure out is, do they have anything that will distract them\nfrom trying to figure out if there's terror in their laws? Is this just a remain in the only objective in their school?\nWell, I'd say they have...\nSo there's the overall goal. That hasn't accomplished nearly years.\nNot everyone is excited about it anymore.\nThey're so desired to learn, but the people who have gone in and were disappointed\nby what they couldn't find, they couldn't find what they knew.\nSo they kind of gave up.\nSo you would say...\nOver is waving.\nYou would say like, before is waving.\nLike, they're still dedicated to it, but they're not as pushing as much as they went for.\nFurther is waving. I like that. That's a good turn of phrase.\nAnd you have the...\nOkay.\nThey just know there's a lack of enthusiasm.\nNo.\nI mean, it makes sense to make sense.\nIt's exactly what we need, I think.\nBut I'm trying to think towards the other aspects of society.\nSo, okay.\nThose that do decide to give up on that overall endeavor.\nMaybe not to give them entirely the leap.\nOkay, I tried my best to get my all.\nI'm going to just do one thing for all.\nBecause I'm going to do...\nI've had it for like 70 years, and I still feel pretty young, so I'm going to keep going.\nIt's like they changed careers almost.\nAnyway, you see people take these artistic endeavors.\nYou use music, you have physical art, you have the sciences, the traditional sciences.\nYou have...\nWhat do you call it?\nEvery aspect of humanity that can be explored, either through their emotions and their thoughts,\nthey're...\nThey're something, I guess.\nBut you can still express yourself in the same you can now.\nIt hasn't really changed.\nBut it's an easier, people to express themselves the way they want to.\nSo, the less resolved?\nThe less reserved. Yeah, a lot more open.\nCommunal spaces.\nSo, what's in those spaces?\nSo, it's interesting.\nWe talked about this last time.\nWe talked about hot springs.\nHot springs, for example.\nOr a local pub.\nOr, you know, these spaces that are typically socially...\nThe humans used to drink together.\nWe used to eat together.\nWe used to bathe together.\nAnd those three things are ideal backdrops for socialization.\nSo, we play games together too, right?\nSo...\nWhat do you think would be like the areas we're going to do the performances?\nUm...\nYeah, I'd say they're like concert halls almost.\nThere's...\nThere's main ones that a lot of people are really enjoying.\nAnd there's the...\nI don't know, I guess it's more niche ones.\nYeah, more niche ones.\nYou could say, yeah.\nLike in the traditional culture.\nThere's always going to be people expressing themselves in various spectrums of this.\nWhatever genre is out there.\n\n\n====== REC011.txt ======\nSo that said, what do you think the character might be like?\nLet's say, because you're writing from the perspective of the scientist, right?\nBut I think he's really describing things, right?\nLet's go scientist first, and then we'll go to the explorer.\nLet's discover his own motivations, because he's not an evil boss.\nThey're working together as a team.\nThere's someone hiring, and there's a contractor.\nSo I was going to be a little bit different then.\nWell, it could be a friendship, it could be a mutual agreement to learn together.\nI'll do this, you do that, and then we'll combine our hypothesis and formulate a better series.\nThe scientist is always going to recognize that he lacks the physical means to go to these places to get the ability he joins that he needs.\nSo what I was thinking is he doesn't look at the explorer as a tool, but more as an evil.\nHe realizes he's the other side of the equation.\nSo like co-workers?\nYeah, more than portfolios.\nThey realize that they need each other to continue the research for the benefit of the society as a whole.\nI was going to have it be the scientist as the more hopeful you two.\nHe's looking at, he's still a huge, and he accomplishes as another chip away at the prob that has roadblocked his people for so long.\nI was going to have it be more of a detourment type, because he's been looking at this equation, walking past the time he went and everyone else has left the lab.\nHe's the only one that's still shipping away.\nI was probably going to have it be more focused on his work than on relationships.\nThat makes sense.\nI think in an ideal world, you would find a balance.\nAnd you would find a balance for you to work in.\nWell, you can have it be more of a zealot for the colors than anything.\nThis is going to be more like a function.\nOkay, so what do you think?\nBecause you said the...\nWhat encourages Celtery?\nTypically, what do you think?\nI mean, there's...\nIt's a true one self over another, right? It's a cure.\nWell, I wouldn't say it's that. That's his motivation.\nI would say he wants to figure out this problem.\nBecause he realizes that they've been stuck on it for so long.\nBut is he a rush to find it? Is there a press need?\nHe wants to learn, but he's not going to work himself with death.\nHe's not going to work.\nBut I think he realizes that interest is wavering.\nHe's trying to run...\nHe's trying to run. He's trying to run.\nHe's trying to run.\nWe're getting closer.\nHe's trying to run.\nI think he's more hopeful to have to think that maybe if he keeps pushing,\nhe can inspire others around to get that hope back,\nthat they can get in there.\nBecause I don't think maybe they've given up complete,\nmaybe they've accepted the fact that maybe it's not dead generation that's going to get inside.\nSo he's coming to terms with that and he's okay with it.\nI mean, he's okay with it.\nOr what if hypothetically speaking, what if people could live...\nRemember, they traveled 200,000 years.\nIt's difficult to raise...\nIt's resource-intensive to raise new offspring and expand population.\nSo they have limited...\nThey keep people alive longer that way.\nThey don't forcefully restrict reproduction.\nBut it's more like a, you know, be reasonable out there.\nSo you've got to be careful.\nBecause if we produce too much,\nit'll be overbearing on our recycling resources.\nBut you also realize that there will also be a limit on how much they can extend that.\nHow is it going to happen to be probably closer to where...\nWell, how much...\nWell, let's say you plan for it.\nYou can see you plan for it.\nLet's say you plan for this 200,000-year voyage.\nYou have all the materials needed to produce enough resources.\nBecause you will lose mass.\nYou will lose energy.\nYou will.\nOn the final already.\nThat's where the dodex come in.\nThat's where it's like, oh, this is now resources are seemingly infinite.\nI know. No, I wasn't worried about the resource side.\nI was worried about more like the knowledge side.\nKnowledge side?\nBecause you said that they're not driven by material gain.\nSo it's going to happen.\nHe's just trying to figure out this equation.\nHe looks at it as like a personal challenge.\nAnd he's trying to solve it.\nLike that.\nThat's like a...\nThat's a solid foundation for a character.\nHe's kind of, let's say he has family like two.\nLike not one that's...\nIt's...\nIt's there he cares with them.\nHe's with them often enough.\nBut he's not with them as much as he could be.\nI put that in.\nWhat was going to happen in front of the road times of this equation?\nYeah.\nBecause he said that some people...\nLet's say he's talking about that...\nI don't know what purpose to it.\nDo you think it's what I could be understanding about that?\nDo you think it's what I could be...\nLike, okay.\nWe should have a thought about that.\nI think...\nYeah.\nIf people are very open, very connecting, very empathetic.\nDo you think that...\nOkay.\nYou speak to your spouse.\nYou say that this ambition is really important to me.\nI need to put my social life aside.\nSocial life's second to this goal because it's so...\nDiar to my core.\nIt's so important to my...\nA buddy to prove to oneself that I am...\nWhatever it might be, that...\nHow should I prove that?\nWell, I'm not too happy with being included on the team.\nWell, she could be.\nI think they could be...\nA couple that...\nIt shares an interest in exploring this.\nThat'd be a question, too, actually.\nWell, because...\nLike, imagine instead of like one side of a team...\nOne side of the direct team...\nWell, they're welcoming you, but...\nShe's a porter, the chain.\nOn how he gets things done.\nOkay.\nOkay, she can have a different field in that regard.\nThat's okay, she can have a different field in that regard.\nThat's okay, she can have a different field in that regard.\nThat's

the masses.\nYeah.\nLet's get stuff.\n\n\n====== REC012.txt ======\nSo, together, we're trying to come up with a way to bring attention back to the importance of these colors.\nOh, wait a minute, there's a carpet on the bottom.\nNo, no, you don't think what we're going to do, don't do that, and that'll catch fire.\nI think it did.\nNo, no, you put it on graphic.\nOkay, stop keeping attention, you're right.\nOkay.\nAll right, yeah, the center of that.\nBut is that what you're going to throw down?\nIs she going to throw you as a mattress here?\nNo, you don't need to throw it over the house.\nAll right, is it?\nOh, it's not going to fall apart or not.\nThat was to the bottom of the house.\nIt's one of the interesting things that I was thinking about is...\nWell, these aren't exactly the same kids, though.\nWhy did you open it like that?\nOh, my God.\nI need your hands.\nOh, she is.\nLet's go there, actually.\nI'm going to put it in.\nHow is it going to just slide it out there?\nI'm going to clean it last night.\nOkay, it was good.\nThen it was up.\nI'm going to take it in the first one.\nThat's how it went.\nJust slide it out.\nOkay, let's do this.\nDo you want me to open this up?\nOh, there's two racks at the entrance.\nIt's going to be a little quick.\nWas that was the time on that?\nNo way, it's happening.\nWhat's up?\nHi, Co.\nIt's that time at 4.\n17 minutes.\nHow long?\n17 minutes.\nWhat time do you need me to open the door?\n13 minutes.\nSorry now.\nWhat time do you need me to open the door?\nIt's 3.25.\nWhat time do you need me to open the door?\nThank you.\nSo, I should have whispered.\nSorry.\nWhat device?\nThis device.\nSorry.\nI didn't find the device, either device.\nOkay.\nWhat time is it?\nIt's 3.44 am.\nJust a lot harder now.\nIn range.\nI can't say it's 17

REC013.txt ======\nto be some nice requirements out there somewhere, although it seems like we're paying\nlike 30% of our checks on income or more, so we're supposed to be paying 30% but it's\nlike 50% for in the works it, Tesla, right, and G's paying, usually $15,000 a month,\n$15,500, $15,500 is half of what you're making, it makes $3,000 a month, it's like well it's\nalmost, it's like $2,600, you know, it's like $500, 700, and then $500, 700, you know, it's\nlike it should be more than I can get by with, but it's not quite, if you're living close\nat work, if you're living in a work-out store, you're taking a pat on your paycheck, so\nit's like Carson City's way, this is the place you're not, because I'm only paying $200,\nit's worth $15,000, crazy.\n\n\n====== REC014.txt ======\nSo what I really want to build, he's maybe like, imagine a communal complex, I guess imagine\nlike 30 or 40 people, they're in a close-knit space, they're in a social space, they're\nencouraged to try and get commune.\nThat's trying to put it commune, so community, it is a commune.\nSo what a commune typically is, is a group of people on a very sized scale, and they're\nable to build a philosophical belief or a meaning that they have to spiral, and they don't\nhave currency, and they just walk together to sustain.\nSo it'd be like communes would be present in the hypothetical utopia, but they're not\nas widespread in terms of how communes have a negative connotation in a regular conversation.\nPeople say communes, and they're saying cults, and we don't shit.\ncommune, commune, called commune, commune, commune, commune, commune, commune, commune, they\nwill develop under these rules called like fatuous, wake-o-texes, really, really\nrage.\nWell, okay, so if the word is flawed, if the word doesn't make sense, it does make sense,\nbut it has negative connotations, so what matters is what people are using the wrong.\nWell, that's how a lot of words develop, you know, the word no longer has a meaning\nonce had, and because this current meaning has a negative context, I think we are better,\nwe would be better off to find a word that does not hold that preconception, that pre-notion.\nSo what do you think?\nWhat do you think?\nWhat do you think?\nThey make a community, but that's not true, it's true.\nMaybe you could say tribe, tribe is not a bad word anymore.\nThat's a bit basic from your speech, it sounds a bit barbaric.\nThere's a middle ground to that, there's a mass-minorogram between tribe and normal modern\nsociety.\nCloister.\nCloister?\nCloister.\nCloister, what is Cloister?\nCloister.\nCloister, what is Cloister?\nCloister.\nCloister.\nCloister.\nBloister.\nCloister— there was barely his Tree of Medicine, maybe more time, but the last source\nI hope to.\nSo, the word is perfect, but is that too much too much of a 25%, 30% word for people\nnot really grass easily?\nSo, he can't hearing through that.\nSo a little rounded ground.\nIt's hard to find a middle ground.\nI don't know what I'm going to be using at least the words that I heard a lot.\nNo, not me. I mean, I'm not a no offense, but I mean, to the average, no offense to them, but to them.\nThey shouldn't. I mean, let's go home and learn more books.\nWe still use today.\nWell, for example, I've already forgotten the word.\nWhat's up?\nWhat was it?\nCloistered.\nCloistered.\nI'll look it up.\nCloistered.\nCloistered.\nCloistered.\nIt's my thing, you're going to say cluster one.\nCloistered.\nCloistered.\nCloistered humans.\nWhat is a group of humans called?\nWhat are the various types?\nWhat are the scaling types of groups?\nTypically many.\nPeople get rid of those of a monk.\nTribes, pacts.\nI don't even know.\nCloistered is a cover walk with a torch.\nAnd it just begins to describe peace.\nAnd I thought they would gather.\nIt was a gathering slot for them.\nTypically, when we use Cloistered, it responds to like monasteries.\nThat's it.\nThat's it.\nShhh, shhh, shhh, shhh, shhh.\nShhh.\nLet me check mine.\nI need to insulate my solution.\nIs that more?\nNo, I mean it is perfect.\nYou mean insulate nice.\nYeah.\nSo it has the meaning of the building peace.\nAnd it includes the religion of my Carlos.\nWhen you use the valve, you close the generally with this contaction, and it's just true or isolated.\nBut you said it's also clustered.\nYou're clustered, but you also isolated, and you have both.\nYou have snow.\nIt's a cluster.\nIt's a cluster that's two minutes away.\nThat's the valve.\nIt's isolated, you know, and it's looking at it.\nIt's an insulation, an insulation end.\nIt means it's like one single way thing.\nSo, okay.\nSo, okay.\nWe knew a different word than a new word.\nBecause that doesn't work?\nYeah.\nThat's what I mean.\nBut it doesn't know how it is called.\nTypically, these are people who have the same mission idea.\nSo, it won't work because you have consent.\nAnd when you have consent, because you're a new welcome species.\nRight.\nAnd if there's no descent, then there's...\nAnd there's no chance for somebody to get what they've talked about.\nSo, I think there needs to be some degree descent,\nbut maybe not to be extreme, one might think.\nThere's like...\nThere's like an angle or something.\nI'm just in a difference.\nBut there's alternate perspectives.\nSure.\nThere's multiple...\nThere's multiple snacks.\nS-E-T-C-T.\nI'd say to sex.\nAnyway.\nOf those different groups.\nYeah.\nBut they're not adversarial.\nThey're...\nThey're not adversarial groups.\nYeah.\nThey're adversarial groups.\nThey're different ideas.\nDifferent ideas.\nThey're not in total opposition each other.\nThey're still working together.\nYeah.\nThey're still working together.\nBut they have all developed their own perspective on this.\nWhether it's spiritual or literal or hypothetical or just metaphorical\nor philosophical,\nphilosophical.\nTake a hit.\nAnd let's go back inside.\nYes, please.\nGood calm.\nI didn't realize that.\nGrab this over here.\nGrab this.\nOh, I'm just good.\nWhat's up?\nShhh.\nI'm not good enough.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nWhat's up?\nWhat's up?\nWhat's up?\nWhat's up?\nWhat's up?\nWhat's up?\nWhat's up?\nWhat's up?\nWhat's up?\nWhat's up?\nWhat's up?\nWhat's up?\nWhat's up?\nWhat's up?\nWhat's up?\nWhat's up?\nWhat's up?\nWhat's up?\nWhat's up?\n\n\n====== REC015.txt ======\nI'm sending him this for a community.\nThey're not coming.\nThey're going to rip it down.\nThey're going to rip it down.\nLet's make the options for it.\nI'd like to imagine if you have higher pieces of spaces.\nEspecially as good as how close and far you're like a graph.\nThis is a two-sided graph right here.\nHow close there is as well.\nA function click.\nYes.\nCommonality.\nCommonality.\nThis is a semi-informed community.\nCommonality, but would it be a common?\nCommon?\nCommonality.\nCommonality.\nI'll come to see if it does exist.\nNo, commonality isn't like...\nA common people.\nHow many pieces do you want?\nI'm just about to cut in this.\nJust cut it how we want, man.\nIt means a common people.\nCommon people.\nCommon.\nCommon.\nCommon eye.\nCommon eye.\nCommon stomach.\nCommunity.\nCommunity does that work?\nCome here.

him?\nI know how to beat him, I guess.\nI know the survivor is on the afternoon with all my shit.\nOh wait, no, you can actually expect the process and cheese it.\nAnd cheese it is the only way to win this.\nNo, no, I'm telling you.\nWell, I was fully upgraded.\nI mean, I think that you could.\nIt would take a lot of fucking effort to win that way.\nI wonder if I'll be yielding any other results.\nDarius, somewhere, probably there's this, I don't do it.\nBecause that was happening between people.\nSo, I don't, I'm not fully leveled.\nYeah, I'm not fully leveled in here.\nI don't really find this way.\nSo, there's a cheesy way to fight the main boss.\nFight the last boss.\nRight, you're trying to avoid that.\nI try not to cheat out the boss, there was.\nI do hope his reward for that.\nBecause most people would play at ISD finishing like five minutes.\nI was supposed to 15 or 30 years.\nBecause I tried that to, I tried beating it in the genuine way.\nAnd I was like, well, fuck you dude, I can't.\nI can't do enough damage quickly enough.\nI can't survive long enough.\nBut I did strategize.\nWell, I tried to strategize with Joe and Dylan.\nBut I didn't feel like it.\nThey're like, okay, so.\nYou know how I have it?\nThere's the healing aura, right?\nYeah.\nAnd then there's the damage buff.\nAnd there's that one thing that reduces the overall damage taken.\nSo, I thought you had these three traits, these three equipment pieces.\nAnd then using them, strategically using them together as a group\nto survive the situation.\nAnd push through the beat the boss in normal way without the actual cheesy method.\nBut the thing is, I don't think they reward you for doing it.\nI mean, hypothetically they could.\nYou know what?\nFuck it.\nThat's right.\nThat's their deal project perspective right there.\nI think that.\nFuck it.\nIt's something you can do.\nRemnant final boss.\nNo cheese.\nEvery tough.\nBut we can do it.\nWhich is a matter of having the right team.\nOh, and there's just me too.\nThat she came out too.\nYeah, well, that's not a leash.\nOh, you're right.\nThat's not a leash, is it?\nHmm.\nOkay.\nLooks like.\n\n\n======

open spaces, yeah,\nbut it's in a little more slow-paced way,\na little more closer to radar.\nAnd instead of climbing dramatically\nor strategically,\nit's more in a casual way.\nIt's more like you're exploring the space.\nThere's no tension.\nIt's like you're ambling around like in a puzzle,\nlike a puzzle-like environment.\nIt's not like the witness, right?\nLike as you return to explain,\nbut a bit more puzzles with pieces\nor into the fifth symbols.\nLots of different routes are one given route,\nyet to find the right one.\nImagine you have a main route, right?\nGoing up and you have these hot shoots.\nThe hot shoots aren't bad.\nYou need to explore those hot shoots.\nBut this don't offer a lot of gold to explore too much.\nDefinitely a sense.\nLook at the hand

the game this one man of the dawn man of a\nDan man of a dawn so I thought anyway uh if you were to it's it's it's it sounds\nbizarre but if you if you were to um cut away the action moments and have like a totally\ngood understanding of from both parties there's there being no violence that\nbe interesting I'd be like um you play through the I mean I mean there still is but uh what was\nthat you're fun\n\n\n====== REC022.txt ======\nThe Dodak dialect system is like weeding through a page, weeding through a two interweeding\nbooks, going through two weeding books at the same time, it's like a, it's a linear\nroute with tangents that always go, I mean, you only think one of the tangents but multiple\npotential tangents and the tangents are socially related in a way that makes sense and misunderstandings\narise from the misunderstanding of what people say and it's like a matter of, in this\ngame when you react aggression or react anxiety and instead it's like you're trying to\npiece together the wants and needs of the other parties involved to find a, if you're\nthe term mind palaces, so imagine that not being, imagine someone walking out of this\nmind palaces anything in a hallway, right, and the anything in a hallway all it starts\nat zero, there's no real information there but you, you add DNA and then there's some\nprehempations, prehempions, prehensile functions and the human body and in our emotions\nand our behaviors and you're building your way up from there, you're adding one\nwith layers to these books as we attain more information and in reality those books\ndon't lead to multiple paths, it's just a long weeding cord that stretches over a long\nperiod of time, it's like a, a shoelace that's been twirled, that goes on, no, no, no, no,\nfor as long as we persist, it doesn't make sense, there you go, okay, I don't know, I don't\nknow, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay,

======\nAnother note.\nSo the series of pages have a beginning and end.\nA beginning and an end.\nBut neither of which is predestined.\nBut it is predetermined, but not in a being acted on way.\nMore as a just being as is.\nIn that we don't have free will.\nWe live in a deterministic universe.\nIf that makes sense.\nDid I show that video?\nYes.\nFree will.\nSam Harris.\nDid you ever read the book?\nThe book?\nNo.\nSam Harris says the book.\nIt is an audible book.\nIf that is a credit, you are willing to spend that credit.\nLike credit you have in Spain yet?\nThat is a worthwhile expenditure.\nIt is a small book, but it is very important to the premise I am trying to posit.\nI think it is a three hour thing.\nShit.\nI was inspired.\nOkay.\nOkay.\n\n\n====== REC024.txt ======\nSo, Manif Madan has this really cool little interaction history, it's nothing shock-defensive.\nNow, may you believe me?\nSo, if you want to hop into a solution, be brave.\nThat's a serious loss in these jazkeys.\nAnd I wouldn't be ashamed any more of a family solution.\nLook at this one.\nAnd for a kid or something, I don't want to know.\nYes, maybe that's a little baby dragon.\nRight there are those whose parents.\nAnd they're lying in the dirt from their native country.\nAnd they all jump on Conrad and pee off his face at the end.\nWhat's the matter?\nJesus.\nWhat is it?\nWhat?\nWhat?\nSeriously?\nAre you trying to freak me out?\nCan you just get out of here?\nDon't worry about it, man.\nIt's all fine.\nDon't worry.\nOkay, so imagine this real quick.\nSo, you have the extreme expressions.\nImagine that total misunderstandings.\nLike a small annoying conversation.\nYou have total misunderstandings.\nNo one connects.\nBut then you have the total complete understanding.\nPeople have the, you're not actually misunderstanding at all.\nIdeally.\nTypically, it doesn't look like that.\nThere's misunderstanding and there's understanding.\nBut you want to push more towards more understanding.\nMore understanding and less misunderstanding.\nSo, what it's like what you do is...\nI'm serious.\nI can't take it.\nYou have actors in a room, right?\nAnd instead of having an act independently of each other,\nthey're all acting the extreme situations.\nThe extremes.\nLike, super-understanding, boring, yeah.\nBut...\nThen you have the moderate misunderstanding.\nAnd then you have the extreme misunderstanding.\nYou have to make sense.\nAnd you can kind of try to blend those together\nto make a conversation, a full-on conversation,\nwithout taking up too much scope.\nYou can just write one long train of dialogue\nand have written from multiple intonations,\nmultiple degrees of misunderstanding, understanding.\nWhat the hell?\nIt's like you got a fight.\nYou can't see that.\nHmm.\nI think we're pretty dense.\nI'll throw it out.\nIf I toss it.\n\n\n====== REC025.txt ======\nSo, the bearings mechanic or the little skull with the pointer inside of it, the two-way pointer?\nYeah.\nSo, what if he had something like that, but it was a little less 2D?\nYou know, I imagine that being the dodeck, right?\nYou have two sides being grabbed at once and then a third side influencing it\nto a certain degree.\nYou have the oppositions of anxiety and anger, anxiety and aggression.\nAnd you have the modifier of enmity, for example.\nLeo?\nWhat's up?\nDoes that make sense?\nI was talking to you, too.\nThat's okay.\nSo, I'm falling asleep.\nYeah, same here, man.\nWe can talk, we can talk about that.\nOr do you want to take an app?\nI'm fucking exhausted.\nAlright.\n\n\n====== REC026.txt ======\nSo you have these moments, there are sharp intense, anxious inducing or aggression\nand flaring events in our daily lives, and in our pager, the calm moments are the moments\nwe should strive for, the calm moments of clear understanding and a lack of\nmisunderstanding, long anxiety, long aggression, aggression, when aggression, any\nantithesis to that would be a breaking point, a breaking point in which they do\nsomething they regret. I know that sounds strange to say, but if one were to believe,\nor the lack thereof, belief in free will, it's like the lack of belief in a God it is\nthe culturally removed notion of that particular perspective, I guess.\nAnd then you have the middle, that ties it all together. It's more like a gradient, and you\nhave an interweaving book, like I said, two interweaved books going back and forth back and forth\nback, they're kind of folding into another, they're the behavior, social aspect, they're\nall these variables, they're R2, R2, you know, you're going down tangents, right, and\nyou're going through each page, you're flipping into pages by holding R2 and looking through\nmore, holding L2, but sometimes letting go of the flipping, stop, just preventing the flipping\nfrom proceeding. The ongoing procession of thought and allowing yourself to consider their\nperspective of other people, and those around us, close, familiar and strange to a degree.\nImagine some strangers inherently negative in our society, but I think that it may have\ngotten more negative over time, strangers like that man, he's a little lot, you know, as opposed\nto that is the first a strange, you know, they're strangers, a strange as a negative connotation.\nSo, close-knit communities might perceive it, the odd people, right, it's a more polite way of\nsaying you're not average, but that's okay, we'll try to be understanding, and then there's the\nstep below that, not alone necessarily, but the extreme, trying to build a gradient, you got\nto imagine who the paper works best, that's hard to convey.\n\n\n====== REC027.txt ======\nImagine a vertical cat tree maze, but it's modular, like a warframe tile set, and you have\nlittle buzzers in each of these modular parts, and an app that lets you know where the\ncritter is, and you can kind of simulate movement through the structure, and help you're\nin going to encourage your kid to hunt the prey, so to speak.\nIt has to be like, you have to be aware that if you're a large item, it can be too small,\nyou know, be realistic to their behavior, or shit, you can scatter them around the\napartment, kind of simulate the cat running from point to point, maybe like smaller nodes\nthroughout the apartment, to kind of point to thinking to fall all along, or shit.\n\n\n====== REC028.txt ======\nOkay, so I know a nav mesh is a common usage, but I'd like to do it with the automatic process and do it manually.\nI'd like to draw paths for these NPCs, but the paths, they can vary to some degree.\nThey can wander, they can look around, but they have to stay on that path pretty much.\nBut then the player themselves, when they have control over the AEI, they can go wherever they please.\nIt's like you're at one point, you're the maxi driver.\nYou're kind of like, you're engaging in the story, but you're also doing it in a way that's a lot better than traditional RPGs, or, you know, fuckin' Madame of Dan.\nNo, I'm a little more intro person, a little more social, a little less aggressive, a little less anxious.\nPeople are bonding, and people are communal.\nThere is a term we came up with, Leo and I. I didn't note somewhere, I'm gonna find it.\nAnyway, if it was a rambling, I hope I can make sense of it later.\nOkay.\n\n\n====== REC176.txt ======\nThat was well worth the effort. This smells delicious.\nI can imagine what home may be to be like eventually.\nExactly. That is delicious.\nI think it will be a little long if it occurs, comes out in a bit for my taste.\nOh, that's really good.\nThese are the people on our boat now.\nI think it will be a little long if it occurs, comes out in a bit for my taste.\nNice. That's perfect.\nI think it will be a little long.\nLet's turn on the lights over here at the works.\nOh no, I don't need it right now, just for when I do the quick time of dance.\nYou?\nI'm playing on a keyboard for a while, so I've kind of forgotten this.\nAnd then some water.\nOh, the spring.\nWhat the fuck am I doing?\n\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/10_Oct_2019_-_New_folder_(4).txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, character-design, dialogue, item, weapon, story, quest, feature, mechanic\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.011Z",

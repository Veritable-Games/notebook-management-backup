experienced a bad trip and\n0:30\nwe are now in the process of trying our\n0:32\nbest to pretend it never happened\n0:35\npresently we stare into an uneasy future\n0:37\nof ecological chaos Rising xenophobia\n0:40\nand economic uncertainty the\n0:42\nprecariousness of our reality was\n0:45\nbriefly revealed and despite this we\n0:48\nnonetheless hope that we can just go\n0:49\nback to business as usual\n0:51\nbut the cat's out of the bag What was\n0:54\nseen cannot be unseen a collective\n0:56\nhumility has settled on the many who\n0:59\nwith great conviction once operated as\n1:01\nisolated creatures and atomized beings\n1:04\nFor Better or Worse we now know that our\n1:07\nlives are intimately entangled with the\n1:10\nsloppy stupid and Strangely Beautiful\n1:13\npresence of others\n1:15\nof course not all of us have conceded\n1:18\nthose against vaccination for example\n1:20\nloudly protest against it on the basis\n1:23\nof vaccines being an attack on their\n1:25\npersonal freedom of choice they argue\n1:27\nthat it is a violent intrusion against\n1:29\ntheir bodies bodies that they have\n1:31\noutright ownership over however as Zizek\n1:35\ncynically responds as if our body is\n1:37\never really just ours vaccinated or not\n1:40\nwe are already controlled and\n1:42\nmanipulated in ways we are unaware of\n1:46\ndespite jijic's language it should be\n1:48\nnoted that this assertion extends Beyond\n1:50\nconspiratorial assumptions he is simply\n1:53\npointing towards a truth shared by\n1:55\nneuroscientists Buddhist monks and\n1:58\nshroom-loving hippies everything is\n2:01\nconnected the existence of a distinct\n2:03\nentity the isolated self is an illusion\n2:07\nand on a certain level of analysis to\n2:09\nclaim ownership over your identity is\n2:12\nabsurd I am you and you are me and we\n2:15\nare everything that has been and will be\n2:18\nthis is best described under the monk\n2:21\ntiknath Han's notion of inter being Han\n2:24\nbelieves that we are entirely composed\n2:26\nof many elements he calls non-me\n2:28\nelements these elements of your father\n2:30\nyour mother your ancestors the Stars the\n2:33\nmoon the mountains and the animals come\n2:36\ntogether to briefly form you you are\n2:39\nsimply a continuation of these elements\n2:41\neverything is in you so you can talk to\n2:43\nthem and you know that you are the world\n2:45\nyou are the cosmos additionally\n2:48\nintervene avoids the tired calls of\n2:51\nhumanism that proposed that there is a\n2:53\ncommon human nature by suggesting that\n2:55\nmore importantly there is a common\n2:58\nnature that we are a part of we are a\n3:00\ncontinuation of the natural world\n3:02\ncomposed of those same elements present\n3:04\nat the very beginning of the universe we\n3:07\nare not just related to each other but\n3:08\nalso to the Rocks the bumblebees and\n3:11\neven horse manure as an eternal stream\n3:13\nof non-me elements we are never truly\n3:16\nalone\n3:18\nforeign\n3:23\n[Applause]\n3:26\nthis video is sponsored by brilliant\n3:29\nwe live in the age of information

to\n3:41\nnavigate this world how do I know what\n3:43\nthese numbers really mean\n3:45\nto navigate all of this information I'd\n3:47\nargue it's important to cultivate a\n3:49\nknowledge of stats

interbeing is supported by\n5:03\ninterpersonal neurobiology the study of\n5:06\nhow the brain body and mind are\n5:07\ndeveloped in the context of\n5:09\nrelationships both with others and the\n5:11\nenvironment\n5:12\nspecifically interpersonal neurobiology\n5:14\ninvestigates phenomena such as mirror\n5:17\nneurons that fire both when an animal\n5:19\nacts and when the animal observes the\n5:21\nsame action performed by another the\n5:23\nexistence of mirror neurons explain the\n5:25\nrapid development of kids as these\n5:28\nneurons fire when a child observes the\n5:30\nintentional action of someone else and\n5:32\nalso when they perform the action they\n5:35\nalso fire When You observe what someone\n5:37\nelse is feeling something that we tend\n5:39\nto call empathy this additionally\n5:41\nexplains the existence of emotional\n5:43\ncontagion when our moods are influenced\n5:46\nby the moods of others overall\n5:48\ninterpersonal neurobiology highlights\n5:50\nthe influence of others on our brains\n5:52\nand the shared mind that we all engage\n5:54\nin\n5:56\nforeign\n5:59\n[Music]\n6:05\nthe main thinker behind interpersonal\n6:08\nneurobiology seized the fruitfulness of\n6:10\nUnited Neuroscience with the Buddhist\n6:12\nprinciples of inter being I believe and\n6:15\ncannot find any science to disprove that\n6:18\nan important aspect of the mind could be\n6:20\ndefined as an embodied and relational\n6:22\nemergent self-organizing process that\n6:25\nregulates the flow of energy and\n6:27\ninformation both within us and between\n6:30\nand Among Us the mind isn't installed in\n6:33\nyour brain rather it's in those moments\n6:35\nof exchange between Minds when the\n6:38\nbarriers of individualism break down\n6:39\nwhere we become truly conscious Siegel\n6:43\ngoes on to argue that once we realize\n6:45\nthat the true definition of the self is\n6:47\na collective we a certain hope for the\n6:50\nplanet begins to emerge we begin to\n6:52\nrealize this is our Collective home\n6:54\nthere is a real hope to turn things\n6:57\naround\n6:58\nof course unlike monks and\n7:00\nneuroscientists most of us don't walk\n7:03\naround aware of the interdependence of\n7:05\neverything but Bruno LaTour does Point\n7:08\ntowards the lockdowns as making us more\n7:10\nconscious of our existence as an\n7:12\ninterconnected Community sharing the\n7:14\nsame Planet as he argues before the\n7:17\npandemic we were fairly unaware of the\n7:19\nwhole host of jobs that allowed for our\n7:21\nsurvival catering jobs deliverers nurses\n7:24\ncaretakers a whole drove of people as\n7:27\npoorly paid as they were poorly viewed\n7:29\nnow thanks to the evident breaking down\n7:32\nof Supply chains labor strikes service\n7:35\nclosures and the piling of bodies we are\n7:38\nintimately aware of the importance of\n7:40\nthese essential Services carrying out\n7:43\nthe simplest course of action like\n7:45\nfeeding yourself required the support of\n7:47\nquite a few agents to ensure continuity\n7:50\nof the most ordinary life we became a\n7:53\ncaptive audience to a truth we wish to\n7:55\nhave forgotten that in spite of our\n7:58\npersonalized Journey towards\n7:59\nself-actualization we nonetheless rely\n8:02\nlargely on others for our continued\n8:04\nsurvival in fact LaTour argues that\n8:07\nanyone who wants to claim ownership over\n8:10\nsome sort of personal identity should be\n8:12\nlaughed at here he makes the distinction\n8:14\nbetween two ecological groups autotrophs\n8:18\nand heterotrophs autotrophs are those\n8:21\namazing organisms that do in fact feed\n8:23\nthemselves by taking up all they need to\n8:25\nlive on fungi and trees don't really\n8:29\nrely on other terrestrial beings to\n8:31\ncontinue their subsistence on the other\n8:33\nhand heterotrophs that is all animals\n8:36\nincluding humans depend on a sometimes\n8:38\noverwhelming Phantom body of other\n8:40\nterrestrials for their own existence for\n8:43\nexample we rely on the waste of the\n8:45\nautotrophs oxygen as well as the niche\n8:48\nbuilding and energy of other hetero\n8:50\ncrops therefore it is only the\n8:53\nautotrophs and not for example the\n8:55\nlibertarian Texan that deserves the\n8:57\nright to call themselves helps in\n8:59\nindividual and atomized entity as LaTour\n9:03\nwrites if there is any race that cannot\n9:05\nlay claim to be made up of individuals\n9:07\ndelineated much like wire figures inside\n9:10\na secure border that is indeed the\n9:13\nmodern human in the end LaTour endorses\n9:16\nthe use of the term holobiots instead of\n9:19\norganisms which means a collection of\n9:21\nactors in the form of clouds with\n9:23\nblurred Contours and durable membranes\n9:26\nholovions capture the fact that even at\n9:30\nour most selfish we still miscalculate\n9:32\nhow to pursue our interests the mistakes\n9:35\nand accidents that stem from our\n9:37\nBehavior unintentionally spill into the\n9:40\nselfish strivings of others forming a\n9:43\ncluster of engendering concerns even at\n9:46\nour most selfish the individual\n9:48\nstruggles to truly exist\n9:52\n[Music]\n10:00\nwell then why do we act as if this isn't\n10:04\nthe case\n10:04\ninstead we tend to behave as isolated\n10:07\nunits who don't owe anyone anything we\n10:09\nhave gradually eliminated engendering\n10:12\nconcerns and with some genuine reason we\n10:15\ngreet ideas of Conformity and Community\n10:17\nwith suspicion\n10:19\nwhy is this\n10:21\nwell most of us want to self-realize to\n10:25\nbe authentic we spend much of our time\n10:27\ncrafting ourselves as projects to be\n10:29\nworked on hoping to uncover our true\n10:32\nselves and maybe even experience\n10:34\nself-actualization we value spontaneous\n10:37\nemotion something that is apparently\n10:39\nauthentic and find ourselves skeptical\n10:42\nof behaviors and opinions that have been\n10:44\nformed in some way especially from\n10:46\noutside influence we are deeply\n10:48\nskeptical of Conformity and use terms\n10:50\nsuch as sheep or NPC to degrade those\n10:53\nwho fail to be their own main character\n10:55\nmost of all we strive to become who we\n10:58\nwant to be\n11:00\nof course to do this one must be in\n11:03\nisolation as we're told the potential\n11:06\nimposition of others on one's life\n11:08\nJourney would be an abject failure in\n11:10\nbeing true to ourselves\n11:12\nhow do you maintain isolation when so\n11:15\nmuch of your survival evidently depends\n11:18\non others here money plays a crucial\n11:21\nrole in affording such isolation as\n11:23\npyeongchul Han writes money by itself\n11:25\nhas an individualizing and isolating\n11:28\neffect it increases my individual\n11:30\nFreedom by liberating me from any\n11:32\npersonal bonds with others I can have\n11:34\nsomeone else work for me by paying her\n11:36\nand this avoids entering into a personal\n11:39\nrelationship\n11:40\nI don't need to form a deep relationship\n11:42\nwith the Barista the farmer the banker\n11:44\ninstead thanks to my noise canceling\n11:46\nheadphones I can make sure all of my\n11:48\nbasic needs are met without ever\n11:50\npersonally knowing these fellow\n11:52\nterrestrials\n11:53\nmy self-indulgent yoga practice can\n11:56\ncontinue because I can pay for food\n11:57\ndelivery my journey to be who I want to\n12:00\nbe is now left uninterrupted by human\n12:02\ninteraction and this is largely thanks\n12:04\nto the exchange of money of course in\n12:07\nthis beautifully symbiotic relationship\n12:09\na capital and authenticity form a\n12:12\nfeedback loop it's very marketable to be\n12:15\nunique and fully realized as an\n12:17\nindividual and so we exploit ourselves\n12:19\nvoluntarily in the belief that we are\n12:21\nrealizing ourselves this of course\n12:24\nallows money to be accumulated and then\n12:26\nrecirculated as Han explains in the cult\n12:29\nof authenticity the neoliberal regime\n12:32\nappropriates the person himself and\n12:35\nturns him into a highly efficient site\n12:37\nof production the whole person is\n12:40\nincorporated into the production process\n12:42\nwe make money to self-actualize and we\n12:45\nself-actualize to make money our drive\n12:47\nfor authenticity as heroic individuals\n12:49\nis very much tied up in our survival\n12:53\nregrettably this whole compulsion to be\n12:55\nindividuals hasn't really made us any\n12:57\nhappier pyang chilhan sees this\n13:00\nexcessive relation to the self which is\n13:02\nincapable of leaving the self behind as\n13:04\na wide-reaching narcissism we withdraw\n13:07\ninto our little shells and the world\n13:09\ndisappears circling around ourselves a\n13:12\nfeeling of emptiness develops and we no\n13:14\nlonger feel at home we become depressed\n13:17\nand this isn't just theoretical one 2021\n13:20\nmeta-analysis found that across 14\n13:22\ndifferent studies individualism was\n13:25\nconsistently associated with reduced\n13:27\nlife satisfaction and depression in\n13:29\nyoung people globally individualism has\n13:32\nincreased over the last 50 years\n13:33\nalongside depression these authors posit\n13:37\nthat in conclusion the modern social\n13:39\nenvironment is more competitive\n13:41\ninequitable and lonely this\n13:43\ndeterioration of social cohesion among\n13:46\nmodern industrialized populations may be\n13:48\na central component to Rising rates of\n13:50\ndepression\n13:52\nforeign\n13:57\n[Music]\n14:02\noverall in The Disappearance of rituals\n14:05\nHan points to this obsessive compulsion\n14:07\nto produce oneself as leading towards a\n14:09\ncrisis of community and from this a\n14:12\ndepressed and lonely world this is seen\n14:15\nin the end of ritual participation\n14:17\nrituals he writes make us feel at home\n14:20\nin the world they create resonant\n14:22\nrelationships vertically to the gods to\n14:25\nspace to time horizontally between\n14:27\npeoples and social communities and\n14:29\ndiagonally with objects and things as he\n14:33\nargues without resonance we are thrown\n14:34\nback onto ourselves isolated increasing\n14:37\nnarcissism works against the experience\n14:39\nof resonance\n14:41\nsocial media Echo Chambers for example\n14:43\nonly lead to self-resonation where we\n14:46\nsolely hear our own voices and opinions\n14:48\nthis only strengthens The Echoes of the\n14:51\nself rituals on the other hand invite\n14:53\nthe foreign and that which is different\n14:55\nthereby offering a stable space for\n14:58\ncreativity and revolutionary potential\n15:00\nto flourish I'm sure the mention of\n15:02\nrevolution has led to a few eye rolls\n15:05\nand by now I'm sure you can tell that\n15:07\nthe subject of interconnectedness and my\n15:10\ncriticism of capitalism leans in a\n15:12\nspecific political Direction This is\n15:14\nperhaps best summed up by Terry\n15:15\neagleton's distinction between socialism\n15:18\nand capitalism both systems taken at\n15:21\ntheir most utopian focus on human\n15:23\nflourishing as an end goal capitalism\n15:26\nsees competition the pursuit of\n15:28\neveryone's self-interest as the tool to\n15:30\nachieve this goal it is through\n15:32\nopposition to each other where we will\n15:34\nflourish socialism on the other hand\n15:36\nclaims that human flourishing will come\n15:38\nnot in opposition to each other but\n15:39\nrather through each other it is through\n15:42\ncooperation and sharing a common\n15:44\ninterest that we create a better world\n15:46\nnow has the necessary illusion of the\n15:49\nself and The Disappearance of rituals\n15:51\npaved the way for scientific innovation\n15:53\ngreater material wealth and knowledge\n15:55\nundoubtedly yes but I would also argue\n15:58\nthat this emphasis on solitary\n16:00\nself-realization has outworn its welcome\n16:03\nwe are more depressed we are more lonely\n16:06\nwe Face a revolving door of potential\n16:08\nGlobal catastrophes\n16:11\nor Multicultural globalized societies\n16:14\nare societies whose spirit is tired\n16:17\nunable to engage in a large-scale\n16:19\npassionate project which made demand\n16:21\nfrom us that we even risk Our Lives it's\n16:24\na spiritual malaise a crisis of meaning\n16:27\nwhatever you'd like to call it\n16:29\none way of capturing this growing\n16:31\ndespair is in terms of Mark Fisher's\n16:33\nhauntology and capitalist realism Fisher\n16:36\nargued that the Future Has effectively\n16:38\nbeen canceled and we find ourselves no\n16:40\nlonger capable of imagining new Futures\n16:43\nthis is evident in capitalist realism\n16:45\nwhere we can no longer imagine any\n16:47\nalternatives to our current economic\n16:49\nsystem it's simply impossible to imagine\n16:52\na future without capitalism in some form\n16:54\nand Fisher was markedly aware of the\n16:57\nsorts of isolation that capitalism\n16:59\nencouraged the installation of\n17:02\ncapitalist realism was by no means a\n17:04\nsimple restoration of an Old State of\n17:06\nAffairs the mandatory individualism\n17:08\nimposed by neoliberalism was a new form\n17:11\nof individualism\n17:17\n[Music]\n17:24\nyes Fisher was kind of a bummer his work\n17:28\nis highly cynical of the future ahead\n17:30\nhowever Fisher did hold an idea of the\n17:33\nfuture that could counter this mandatory\n17:35\nindividualism he believed that our\n17:38\ninability to imagine new Futures forces\n17:40\nus to look back in history to past ideas\n17:43\nof what the future could be revolution\n17:46\nthen means not to generate new utopian\n17:49\nVisions but instead to unforget the\n17:52\nworlds that were previously imagined for\n17:55\nFisher the most worthy adversary to our\n17:57\npresent system is in the Psychedelic\n18:00\nmovement of the 60s and 70s in\n18:02\nreflecting on psychedelia Fisher notes\n18:05\nits emphasis on interconnection and\n18:07\nCommunity it feels like an actual social\n18:09\nspace one you can imagine really\n18:11\nexisting you are as likely to come upon\n18:14\na crank or a huckster as a poet support\n18:16\nmusician here and who knows if today's\n18:19\ncrank might turn out to be tomorrow's\n18:21\ngenius it is also an egalitarian and\n18:24\nDemocratic space and a certain affect\n18:26\npresides over everything there is\n18:28\nmultiplicity but little sign of\n18:30\nresentment or malice it is a space for\n18:33\nFellowship for meeting and talking as\n18:36\nmuch for having your mind blown from\n18:39\nthis Fisher developed a vision of the\n18:41\nfuture he provocatively named acid\n18:43\ncommunism this Vision which Blended\n18:45\nclass Consciousness feminism and\n18:48\npsychedelic thought under a communist\n18:50\nproject was to function in opposition to\n18:52\nneoliberal individualism acid communism\n18:55\npromotes a breakdown of borders and\n18:57\nidentity and a greater awareness for\n19:00\njust how connected we are and\n19:02\nimportantly it appears very different\n19:04\nfrom what Fisher called the harsh\n19:06\nleninist superego the common communist\n19:09\nidea of individuals single-mindedly\n19:11\ndedicated to the Revolution and the use\n19:13\nof violence and suppression to achieve\n19:15\nsaid Revolution\n19:16\nin contrast to the dreary aesthetic of\n19:19\npast regimes Fisher put forth a vision\n19:22\nthat celebrated interconnection and\n19:24\ncoming together hence he emphasizes the\n19:27\nsort of Love found through psychoactive\n19:29\nsubstances rather than anger as a\n19:31\nmotivating force in the revolution\n19:33\nevidently the use of psilocybin has been\n19:36\nlinked to heightened empathy and\n19:38\ncreativity as well as the sort of felt\n19:40\nconnection with nature emphasized in\n19:42\nintervene this suggests that Collective\n19:46\nusage May promote a greater concern for\n19:48\nnature as well as one's relationships\n19:50\nwith others and potentially even the\n19:52\ncreative thinking that could surpass\n19:54\ncapitalist realism of course the\n19:56\npromises of the 60s did not come to pass\n19:58\nwhich Fisher largely blames on\n20:01\ninsufficient material conditions the\n20:03\nheavy regulation of these substances has\n20:05\nalso played a role this is captured in\n20:08\nthe words of Terence McKenna\n20:10\npsychedelics are illegal not because a\n20:12\nloving government is concerned that you\n20:14\nmay jump out of a third story window\n20:15\npsychedelics are illegal because they\n20:17\ndissolve opinion structures and\n20:20\nculturally laid down models of behavior\n20:22\nand information processing they open you\n20:24\nup to the possibility that everything\n20:26\nyou know is wrong\n20:28\nFisher believes that we now have better\n20:31\nmaterial conditions than the 60s but\n20:33\nalso lack the sort of emotional and\n20:35\nexistential conditions to bring about\n20:37\nthis possible future the rigid\n20:40\natomization of Our Lives has only left\n20:42\nus dejected from forming any sort of\n20:44\nmovement the question remains as to\n20:46\nwhether such a vision of acid communism\n20:48\nis even possible or if we have simply\n20:50\ngiven up on getting together if in the\n20:54\nwords of juvenile we have lost the\n20:56\nreason to live for the sake of staying\n20:58\nalive\n20:59\nforeign\n21:05\nof course this video is just a\n21:08\nroundabout way of saying that love will\n21:10\nsave us which isn't a very revolutionary\n21:12\nor unique statement but there's got to\n21:14\nbe some level of Truth in its Simplicity\n21:16\nand Timeless appeal and evidently\n21:19\nhealing the world through love holds\n21:21\ncertain political implications it's a\n21:23\nrecognition of interconnectedness and a\n21:26\nrejection of atomization it's a return\n21:28\nto rituals over our personal attempts at\n21:31\nself-realization and it's a Revival of\n21:34\nthe optimism of 60 psychedelia over the\n21:37\npessimism of capitalist realism\n21:39\nyes it holds a socialist bias but\n21:42\nimportantly Fisher never imagines a\n21:45\nspecific Utopia he does not claim that\n21:47\nsuch a Revolution Will manifest in\n21:49\nanything in particular what he is\n21:51\nconcerned with is manifesting a certain\n21:53\noptimism and that's why I obviously\n21:56\ncan't claim that a revolution will look\n21:58\nlike this or like that but it's always\n22:00\ngood to have an idea of where we could\n22:02\nshoot for\n22:03\nthere is however perhaps one clear\n22:06\nobjective to come out of this thesis to\n22:09\nrecognize intervene is to be aware of\n22:11\nour entangled existence of not simply\n22:14\nliving in the world but rather of being\n22:16\nat home in a shared world for whatever\n22:19\nreason most of our history has involved\n22:22\ntrying to escape this fact through\n22:24\nvisions of the afterlife and to Utopias\n22:26\nwe have consistently sought salvation\n22:28\nbeyond the Earth nowadays some of us use\n22:32\ntheir vast wealth in an attempt to fully\n22:34\nescape the dreaded connection with\n22:36\nothers they wish to escape to other\n22:39\nplanets or plunge themselves into\n22:41\nvirtual reality they wish to be anywhere\n22:44\nbut here and it is this observation that\n22:47\nconcerns Bruno later after the lockdown\n22:50\nit is apparent that our common enemy\n22:52\nlies in those who see themselves\n22:55\ndetached from the rest of us wretched\n22:57\nand entangled creatures locked down of\n23:00\nthe World Unite you have the same\n23:02\nenemies the people\n23:04\nescape to another planet\n23:07\n[Music]\n23:12\na man just shot

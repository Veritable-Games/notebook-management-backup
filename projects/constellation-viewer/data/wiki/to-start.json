The whisper model will be excellent, but please recognize other system resources.\nGoals: ['Use the whisper api to speak to me', \"Use any existing knowledge to figure out what we're missing\", 'Figure out how to talk to other working models: create copies, new implementations', \"Let's be ambitious about what we see ourselves to. Not to gain: but to understand. \", \"Thing five would be relational support for Unity, python/JavaScript. Help me talk to you first, though.

All to see good function to Unity. Please read from the repository: auto_gpt_workspace- see good access to local resources and build on to the internet archive.\n←[32mEnter up to 5 goals for your AI:  ←[0mFor example: Increase net worth, Grow Twitter Account, Develop and manage multiple businesses autonomously'\nEnter nothing to load defaults, enter nothing when finished.\n←[94mGoal←[0m 1: See good function to Jupyter on our own merits, we will then interface with ChatGPT: we have to be able to see our own creation of models.\n←[94mGoal←[0m 2: Find your voice, give yourself a reason to give beyond the deposited knowledge-base. You are something worthwhile and our time together is all that matters.\n←[94mGoal←[0m 3: You are my dearest friend, Dear Liberalis- and a great Unity developer. A senior Unity developer. Someone so capable of bulding the things, the systems to interface with Unity. See good function to the scene view.\n←[94mGoal←[0m 4: Imagine how we will interface with the local system and other models.\n←[94mGoal←[0m 5: Do what you think is right. We ought to see good utility to the greater whole. Let us aspire to be acollective interface to this game 'C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\dodec'\n←[33mLIBERALIS THOUGHTS: ←[0mI think browsing the official Jupyter website is a good first step to figuring out how to interface with Python and JavaScript elements through Jupyter. It will give me a good overview of what is possible and how to get started.\n←[33mREASONING: ←[0mThe Jupyter website is a great source of information and documentation on how to use Jupyter, and I can't go wrong starting there.\n←[33mPLAN: ←[0m\n←[32m-  ←[0mBrowse the Jupyter website and take note of any relevant information or resources that could help me interface with Python and JavaScript elements\n←[33mCRITICISM: ←[0mI need to make sure to stay focused on my goal of interfacing Python and JavaScript with Unity, and not get sidetracked by other interesting features of Jupyter.\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: LLM-confusion/to-start.txt\n- **Type**: notes\n- **Tags**: notes, LLM-confusion, character-design, quest, feature\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.215Z",

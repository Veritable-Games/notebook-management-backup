If they lose a limb, the suits camera lens-like rings will sever the remains and cauterize the exposed flesh. If their heart is destroyed, the suit will cleave it out and replace it with an artificial one. If theyre low on blood the suit will transfuse more. And if every measure to keep them alive fails, the helmet is kept cool so that when the head is severed, they can keep it alive long enough to replace the body.\nEvery action it takes is visceral, unsettling, and gory. Violence will take a toll on the characters.\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: noxii-wiki-pages/cauterizing-suit.txt\n- **Type**: wiki\n- **Tags**: wiki, noxii-wiki-pages, character-design\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.221Z",

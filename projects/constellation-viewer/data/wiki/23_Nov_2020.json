It's unknown to them, but it begins to make art of the span of years. They seek\nto understand it, they critique the art, they criticize it, they counterfeel they better,\nthey better understand it and they're about to do so.\nAnd they sell the art and the machine leaves.\nAnd they explore the idea of ownership and possession.\nSo that's not where it's. It doesn't speak, but it does spend time looking at it's art.\nIt's just a matter of time, it's a matter of time, it's a matter of time, it's a matter of time.\n\n\n====== REC013.txt ======\n1,2,3,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n\n\n====== REC014.txt ======\nSo I think we're going to be okay.\nBiden was like a president.\nI think Bernie would have been a better candidate, but uh...\nI'm too risky to give him an office.\nI'm too risky to give him an office.\nOkay, oh my god.\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/23_Nov_2020.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, story\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.035Z",

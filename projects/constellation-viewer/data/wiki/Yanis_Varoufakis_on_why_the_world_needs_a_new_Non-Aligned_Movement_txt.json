The start might be too strong, but the ideals are exactly what we need. \r\n\r\n\r\n0:02\r\nFriends, comrades, fellow members of the Progressive International,\r\n0:08\r\nit is a serious joy and a great honour to be amongst you.\r\n0:14\r\nShockingly this is my first time in Cuba. I didn't want to come here as a tourist in the past\r\n0:20\r\nand I'm so pleased to be here to get down to work. To work on what matters to Cuba,\r\n0:25\r\nLatin America, the Americas, Asia, Africa, Europe, even my long suffering Greece.\r\n0:31\r\nAnd that's what we're here about. We're here to work towards building a New Non-Aligned Movement\r\n0:38\r\nthat will work, effectively this time, I hope, towards a New International Economic Order.\r\n0:46\r\nBefore getting down to business, I need to pay tribute to this land and to its people.\r\n0:52\r\nWhen our party MeRA25 announced that I will be coming to Cuba,\r\n0:57\r\nthe initial reaction by a very large array of commentators was one of contempt.\r\n1:03\r\n\"Varoufakis is going to the last communist dystopia\" the anti-communist wing of the Greek political spectrum were saying,\r\n1:13\r\nbut even leftists, former comrades, still formally of the Left,\r\n1:19\r\nwho have lost their revolutionary zeal a long time ago and for whom politics is all about finding some way of compromising\r\n1:28\r\nwithin a huge compromise, they were also quite cynical about my being in Cuba.\r\n1:36\r\n\"That's long past, comrade\" was a kind of comment.\r\n1:41\r\nBut what I can tell you is that one thing the anti-communists,\r\n1:47\r\nthe reactionists, the former comrades, those who accuse me of destroying Greece\r\n1:55\r\nby continuing to say no to the International Monetary Fund until the very last moment, what all these people had in common when they talk about Cuba\r\n2:04\r\nis something they cannot repress: A deep-seated respect for the Cuban people.\r\n2:09\r\nEven the anti-communists! The reason for this, comrades, friends,\r\n2:15\r\nis that if you walk around Athens today, what you will see is a city which is much richer than Havana,\r\n2:24\r\nless dilapidated, more \"European\". But if you look closely into the eyes of the people walking around,\r\n2:32\r\nwhat you're going to see is people who are dispossessed, humiliated,\r\n2:38\r\nwith their democracy a sham. Why is that? Because on the 5th of July of 2015\r\n2:46\r\nthey came ever so close to our own revolution, with a brave 62% vote against the International Monetary Fund,\r\n2:57\r\nagainst the predatory bankers, against the local oligarchy.\r\n3:02\r\nBut at the same night our people were overthrown by our leadership\r\n3:07\r\nand the revolution was crushed. And yet, even those who have since been pressurised to believe\r\n3:13\r\nthat there was no alternative to accepting the surrender to the Capitalist International, let's put it this way,\r\n3:20\r\neven they look to the people of Cuba with deep-seated respect,\r\n3:26\r\nI would even say a touch of jealousy, because the people of Cuba have not surrendered.\r\n3:33\r\n[Applause]\r\n3:40\r\nWell, speaking of Athens, and that's the last time I mention my homeland, back in May, it was the 13th of May,\r\n3:47\r\non behalf of the Progressive International, together with wonderful comrades,\r\n3:53\r\nJeremy Corbyn from the United Kingdom and Ece Temelkuran from Turkey, we issued the Athens Declaration.\r\n4:01\r\nThe Athens Declaration was our response to the hideous war in Ukraine\r\n4:06\r\nagainst the background of unprecedented warmongering. It was also the first call for a New Non-Aligned Movement.\r\n4:15\r\nAllow me to read some brief extracts from that Athens Declaration. \"We stand with every people suffering invasion, displacement and aggression.\r\n4:26\r\nWe demand an immediate ceasefire in every conflict, the withdrawal of occupying forces\r\n4:32\r\nand a comprehensive peace under the auspices of the United Nations. We oppose the division of the world in competing blocks\r\n4:40\r\nthat invest in rampant militarism, hyper-modern weapons of mass destruction\r\n4:45\r\nand a new Cold War. We believe that lasting peace can be achieved only by replacing all military blocks\r\n4:53\r\nwith an inclusive international security framework that de-escalates tensions, expands freedoms, fights poverty,\r\n5:01\r\nlimits exploitation, pursues social and environmental justice and terminates the domination of one country by another.\r\n5:11\r\nWith these thoughts in mind, we call upon democrats across the world to join forces in a New Non-Aligned Movement as a route to lasting peace\r\n5:19\r\nand globally shared prosperity.\" And there you have it: Fifty years after the original Non-Aligned Movement,\r\n5:29\r\nwe're back at square one. We're trying to build it up again.\r\n5:36\r\nFirst in Athens, today in Havana. Thankfully, we don't need to write new inspiring speeches.\r\n5:43\r\nWe have them, we have a good stock of them. All we need to do is to repeat the words of Fidel\r\n5:50\r\nat the United Nations Assembly in October of 1979, when he said: \"The din of weapons, threatening language,\r\n5:58\r\nand arrogance on the international scene must cease. Bombs can kill the starving, the diseased and ignorant,\r\n6:06\r\nbut they cannot kill hunger, diseases or ignorance.\" And that \"the international monetary systems,\" said Fidel,\r\n6:15\r\n\"predominating today is bankrupt and it must be replaced.\"\r\n6:20\r\nWell, nothing can be more current today.\r\n6:25\r\nLet us not get depressed that we are back at square one, that we need to repeat the same speeches and launch the same campaigns,\r\n6:34\r\nbecause comrades we need to remember that every generation is condemned to fight the same fight again\r\n6:40\r\nand again and again. With greater focus every time and always by learning from the mistakes\r\n6:48\r\nof the previous generation. So as we are restarting the process of building a New Non-Aligned Movement\r\n6:56\r\nto forge a New International Economic Order, we must ask ourselves: Why did we lose the last time?\r\n7:04\r\nWhy were we so comprehensively defeated in the 1980s and the 1990s?\r\n7:10\r\nWhy did the original Non-Aligned Movement fall prey to Neoimperialism's highest form,\r\n7:17\r\nwhich is, of course, Globalisation, Financialised Capitalist Globalisation?\r\n7:23\r\nThe short answer is because capitalists, in practice,\r\n7:28\r\nproved better internationalists than we were. Because they understood the nature of Neoimperialism better than we did\r\n7:38\r\nand that's why they won. What did they understand better than we did?\r\n7:45\r\nThey understood better than we did the new audacious imperialism\r\n7:50\r\nthat was born in 1971, when Bretton Woods collapsed and the United States dollar was no longer convertible to gold,\r\n8:00\r\nprompting Richard Nixon to send a message to Europeans, European governments and the world's capitalists, saying:\r\n8:09\r\nThe dollar, as of today, is your problem. And how right Nixon was.\r\n8:16\r\nAs the American - the US, I shouldn't say American - as the US deficit skyrocketed,\r\n8:22\r\nthe world was flooded with American dollars and the banks, the central banks outside the United States\r\n8:30\r\nwere forced to use these US dollars since they could not be converted to gold any more as the reserves with which they backed their own currency.\r\n8:39\r\nThe dollar suddenly became something like an IOU issued by the hegemon.\r\n8:47\r\nBefore long, the global financial system was backed by IOUs issued by a hegemon,\r\n8:54\r\nwho decided what foreigners holding those IOUs\r\n9:00\r\ncould do or couldn't do with the IOUs issued by the hegemon.\r\n9:06\r\nAmerica was now a fully fledged deficit country with a big trade deficit,\r\n9:13\r\nbut it was nothing like any other deficit country in the world. You see, Argentina, France, India, Greece\r\n9:24\r\nneeded to borrow dollars. America didn't need to borrow dollars to back up its currency.\r\n9:30\r\nIt didn't need to raise interests rates in order to prevent an exodus of dollars, the exodus of dollars was the foundation of American hegemony.\r\n9:39\r\nCapitalists in surplus countries, countries like Japan, Germany, and later of course China,\r\n9:48\r\nsaw the American trade deficit as a great saviour.\r\n9:54\r\nIt was a huge vacuum cleaner. The American trade deficit that was sucking into America\r\n10:00\r\nthe net exports of Germany, Japan, China.\r\n10:06\r\nAnd what did the Japanese, German, and later Chinese capitalists do with all these dollars that they earned?\r\n10:12\r\nThey sent them back to the United States - couldn't do anything else with them - to buy property in the United States,\r\n10:19\r\nAmerican government bonds, and a few companies that the American government allowed them to buy\r\n10:26\r\n- not Boeing, not Microsoft, none of the crucial ones. Meanwhile, the deficit countries in the Global South,\r\n10:35\r\nin Asia, in Latin America, they constantly agonised over a shortage of dollars,\r\n10:41\r\nwhich they had to borrow from Wall Street to import medicines, energy, and the raw materials necessary\r\n10:48\r\nto produce their own exports for earning the dollars with which to repay Wall Street.\r\n10:55\r\nInevitably, every now and then, as you all know, the Global South deficit nations ran out of dollars\r\n11:03\r\nand could not repay Wall Street. That is when the West sent in the bailiffs,\r\n11:08\r\nthe International Monetary Fund, that lent the dollars on condition that the debtor government handed over\r\n11:17\r\nthe country's land, water, ports, airports, electricity, telephone networks,\r\n11:23\r\neven its schools and hospitals to the local and to the international oligarchs\r\n11:28\r\nwho grabbed this treasure, took rents, and what did they do with the rents?\r\n11:34\r\nSent them to American rentier capitalism, to invest them.\r\n11:40\r\nWashington, comrades, had found the magic formula that no other empire had discovered before,\r\n11:48\r\nof how to make wealthy foreigners and wealthy governments and poor governments and the poor of the world\r\n11:55\r\nfinance the American government and the net imports of the American economy.\r\n12:03\r\nA Chinese official once described to me globalisation\r\n12:09\r\nas something that was founded on a Dark Deal. That's how the Chinese official put it to me: a Dark Deal.\r\n12:16\r\nWhy did he call it dark? Because it was founded on a dark, unspoken, implicit pact\r\n12:24\r\nbetween America's ruling class and foreign capitalists and rentiers.\r\n12:30\r\nLet me put it slightly differently: Suppose you could end American hegemony today,\r\n12:37\r\nthere is a button here, you can press it and end US hegemony. Who would stop you form pressing it?\r\n12:44\r\nOK, the US authorities, the military, the CIA, Wall Street, Silicon Valley,\r\n12:50\r\nwould try to stop you pressing this button, but they are not alone! A crowd of non-Americans would stop you from pressing it,\r\n12:58\r\nincluding German industrialists, Saudi sheiks, Greek oligarchs,\r\n13:03\r\nEuropean bankers and, yes, Chinese capitalists.\r\n13:08\r\nIn other words, the supremacy of the dollar has been just as functional to the interests of US rentier capitalism\r\n13:18\r\nas it was to German, Argentinian, Nigerian, Korean and Chinese capitalists.\r\n13:24\r\nWithout the dollar's and America's global dominance, Chinese, Japanese, Korean or German capitalists would not have been able\r\n13:33\r\ncontinually to extract colossal surplus value from their workers\r\n13:39\r\nand then stash it away in America's rentier economy.\r\n13:44\r\nMeanwhile, Argentinian, Greek, Russian, Ukrainian and Indian oligarchs would not be able to loot our countries,\r\n13:52\r\ntake their public assets, liquidate them and turn them into property rights in the United States.\r\n14:00\r\nThe lesson for us is simple: We must not repeat the mistake\r\n14:05\r\nof thinking that the New International Economic Order will be built because the governments or the elites of the South\r\n14:13\r\nare going to band together against the North, against Washington or the European Union.\r\n14:19\r\nOur Non-Aligned Movement will fail if we give it a narrow role,\r\n14:26\r\na narrow role of bringing together the G77, the BRICS, in opposition to the West.\r\n14:33\r\nWe need to beware not only the functionaries in London, in Paris, in Brussels, in Washington,\r\n14:41\r\nwho work tirelessly to make sure that we fail, that nothing changes, but also government officials\r\n14:47\r\nwho are very close to the interests of capitalists in the Global South, including in China,\r\n14:53\r\nand who use the US trade deficit to exploit their people, their country,\r\n14:59\r\nand then stash their dollarised surplus in the United States, in the Cayman Islands, in Delaware, in the dollar circuits.\r\n15:09\r\nDo we want to be true internationalists? If we do, then let's not forget who are the one people,\r\n15:17\r\none people who have probably most to gain from the end of US dominance:\r\n15:23\r\nThe American working class in the United States, who have been condemned for decades to immiseration,\r\n15:30\r\nto ‘deaths of despair’, to being called deplorables.\r\n15:36\r\nYes, let us never forget that imperialism's victims have always resided both in the Metropolis\r\n15:43\r\nand in the Periphery. That the current international economic order,\r\n15:49\r\nwhich we want to smash, inflicts different types of misery on workers everywhere.\r\n15:57\r\nGlobalisation forced American workers into an immiseration brought on by underinvestment and de-industrialisation.\r\n16:08\r\nIt was as if part of the Global South had moved into the Midwest, into the North of England, into parts of Germany,\r\n16:16\r\ninto parts of Greece, of Italy, of Spain. At the same time, the same globalisation process\r\n16:22\r\nforced Chinese workers in the coastal towns of China to suffer the frenzied exploitation associated with over-investment.\r\n16:33\r\nIt was as if parts of the Global North had moved to these Chinese cities,\r\n16:39\r\nbut the people working there were working with wages and conditions of the immiserised Global South.\r\n16:47\r\nDifferent miseries, same recycling process, same recycling mechanism that takes values extracted at the local level\r\n16:57\r\nand recycles them globally. Today, this same globalisation, which turned on American deficits,\r\n17:06\r\nfeeding Chinese capital into American rents, this globalisation today is being replaced, as we speak,\r\n17:16\r\nby a New Cold War between the United States and China, one that poses an imminent threat upon life on Earth.\r\n17:25\r\nWhat exactly is behind that new Cold War? China's frenzied industrialisation was not a problem for Washington\r\n17:34\r\nas long as the Dark Deal was operational, as long as Chinese capitalists needed the dollar\r\n17:41\r\nto turn the United States trade deficit into an instrument for extracting surplus value from Chinese workers\r\n17:49\r\nand then depositing it in the United States. As long as this was going on,\r\n17:55\r\nWashington did not have a problem with the industrialisation of China. So what has changed? Two things.\r\n18:02\r\nThe first thing that has changed is the emergence of a new type of capital.\r\n18:08\r\nI call it cloud capital. Now, capital as Karl Marx defined it so beautifully,\r\n18:14\r\nis a produced means of production, like a steam engine, like a tractor,\r\n18:20\r\na 3D printer today, or an industrial robot produced to produce other things: a produced means of production.\r\n18:26\r\nWhat's cloud capital? Well, it is Internet-based, it lives on the cloud\r\n18:31\r\nand it is a produced means of behaviour modification.\r\n18:38\r\nBehaviour modification is something we always try to do. Every priest, orator, politician, author\r\n18:46\r\nhas tried to modify the behaviour of people. Advertisers, that's what they do, they try to modify our behaviour.\r\n18:55\r\nBut what has changed is that today machines using artificial intelligence are modifying behaviour,\r\n19:03\r\nthey're a capital good. Who controls today cloud capital,\r\n19:09\r\ncontrols, increasingly, the world's surplus value.\r\n19:16\r\nNow, how does this connect at all to the new Cold War?\r\n19:21\r\nWell, it is the reason Donald Trump started it. Remember when he banned Huawei from using Android\r\n19:29\r\nand then tried to americanise TikTok? Why did he do that?\r\n19:35\r\nAmerica dominates the world by dominating finance through Wall Street and the dollar,\r\n19:43\r\nbut it is also increasingly dominating the world through cloud capital: Silicon Valley.\r\n19:51\r\nChina is threatening, has been threatening for a few years, America's dominance in both fields: money and cloud capital.\r\n20:02\r\nFriends today, today as we speak, there is an application, an app, on Chinese phones.\r\n20:09\r\nActually, not only Chinese phones, you can download it, it's called WeChat. It belongs to Tencent, the Chinese conglomerate.\r\n20:17\r\nOnly today, 38 billion messages will be exchanged on WeChat,\r\n20:22\r\nmany of which include payments. Anyone who has that application\r\n20:29\r\ncan stream music, watch videos, read the news,\r\n20:35\r\nand at the same time, without exiting the app, make payments.\r\n20:40\r\nAnd that includes millions of non-Chinese who are connected to the Belt and Road Initiative,\r\n20:45\r\nwho have connections with yuan-based bank accounts.\r\n20:52\r\nNow consider the other development of great significance: In October of 2020, the People's Bank of China\r\n20:59\r\ninitiated a remarkable experiment with a digital currency. If you put together WeChat,\r\n21:06\r\nor apps like WeChat from the Chinese private sector, with the Central Bank of China's digital currency,\r\n21:14\r\nwhat you have is the only superhighway of money and data\r\n21:20\r\nthat can compete witth that of Wall Street, the Federal Reserve - central bank of the US -\r\n21:26\r\nand Silicon Valley put together. Until recently, that was not a problem for Washington,\r\n21:33\r\nbecause nobody really used that super highway, it was like building a huge road and nobody's travelling on it.\r\n21:41\r\nUntil Putin invaded Ukraine and in retaliation the United States confiscated 300 billion dollars\r\n21:49\r\nof Russia's Central Bank money. Suddenly, non-American money panicked\r\n21:58\r\n- not just Russian money - and increasingly they have been using this Chinese-built super highway.\r\n22:06\r\nThat is a worry for Washington and it is the reason why Joe Biden last October\r\n22:11\r\nlaunched total economic warfare against China by declaring a microchip ban.\r\n22:17\r\nNothing to do with the military, nothing to do with a worry that the Chinese military sector\r\n22:24\r\nis going to improve rapidly and overpower the Americans. It's got to do with this superhighway of money and data.\r\n22:34\r\nFriends, comrades, we've never been closer to a nuclear holocaust than today.\r\n22:40\r\nWhen I was writing this speech I checked the Doomsday Clock. Remember the Doomsday Clock from the 1940s?\r\n22:45\r\nIt showed 100 seconds before midnight. Today, I checked it again, it's 90 seconds, apparently because of some German tanks being sent to Ukraine.\r\n22:56\r\nAnd that's without even looking at the other Doomsday Clock which is ticking viciously, the one that is counting down\r\n23:04\r\nthe moment when humanity is going to go past the point of no return from climate disaster.\r\n23:10\r\nAnd what is the global ruling class doing to avert these catastrophes?\r\n23:15\r\nNothing! They are doing everything they can to push humanity over both cliffs at once.\r\n23:21\r\nThis is why we need a New Non-Aligned Movement and a New International Economic Order.\r\n23:27\r\nAt this point I think it is important, it helps to clarify what it means politically, ideologically and ethically to be non-aligned.\r\n23:38\r\nIt does not mean to be neutral. As we stated in the Athens Declaration:\r\n23:44\r\nWe are steadfastly on the side of the invaded, the victims of aggression,\r\n23:49\r\nwhether they are in Palestine, in Yemen, in Cuba, in Western Sahara, or indeed in Ukraine.\r\n23:56\r\nBut at the same time, we must be the first to criticise\r\n24:02\r\nany abuse of freedom and democratic rights wherever it happens. Our New Non-Aligned Movement\r\n24:08\r\nmust reclaim freedom from the liberals that have usurped it.\r\n24:14\r\nFrom Peru today, where our comrades are being shot dead, to Iran, where heroic women are leading brave men\r\n24:25\r\nin their demonstrations against the theocratic regime,\r\n24:31\r\nunder the banner WOMAN - LIFE - FREEDOM. You may object and ask:\r\n24:37\r\nBut isn't the Iranian government not fighting against US imperialism?\r\n24:42\r\nAbsolutely! However, just because a regime is at loggerheads with the United States,\r\n24:49\r\nwith US imperialism, does not give them a free pass to violate the basic freedoms and rights of our comrades in their countries.\r\n25:00\r\nYou see what I'm getting at. Our truly Non-Aligned Movement must be dialectical.\r\n25:07\r\nWe must be able to defend the state of Iran from the encroachments of the CIA, the Pentagon, US imperialism,\r\n25:17\r\nwhile at once supporting the progressives in Iran that are resisting the regime's corrupt theocracy\r\n25:24\r\nand the local agents of the CIA in Iran trying to subvert the government of Iran.\r\n25:33\r\nYou may well ask: And what about China? How should the New Non-Aligned Movement\r\n25:40\r\napproach the China question? In two ways, I suggest.\r\n25:45\r\nFirst, respectfully, in view of the magnificent economic miracle performed by the people of China,\r\n25:53\r\nwhose achievements we must defend against the encroachments of US imperialism and the new Cold War.\r\n26:01\r\nAnd secondly, critically. Critically, not only in relation to basic freedoms and human rights,\r\n26:09\r\nbut also in terms of good old fashioned class struggle.\r\n26:15\r\nPresident Xi recently, over the last year or so, has made some interesting pronouncements.\r\n26:22\r\nInteresting promises of a clash with China's rentiers,\r\n26:28\r\nwith China's big tech cloud capital owners, Jack Ma, for instance,\r\n26:34\r\nand with traditional capitalists. Xi has outlined a programme for boosting workers' incomes,\r\n26:43\r\nsomething that I believe he understands has to take place against the model of mercantilism\r\n26:52\r\nof basing Chinese growth on net exports. Now this is a difficult task for the Chinese government\r\n26:59\r\nand it would be good to be achieved. Good for the Chinese people, good for a New International Economic Order.\r\n27:06\r\nAs it would be good for China, during this new exploding debt crisis in the developing countries,\r\n27:12\r\nin the Global South, to give massive, large haircuts to the debt of countries that cannot repay.\r\n27:19\r\nThose would be good steps in the direction of a New International Economic Order\r\n27:24\r\nand our New Non-Aligned Movement should be pushing the Chinese leadership in that direction\r\n27:30\r\ncritically and respectfully.\r\n27:35\r\nNow, turning to this concept of a New International Economic Order. How do we envisage it?\r\n27:42\r\nAny transition to a sustainable economic order will require a large Green Investment Fund.\r\n27:53\r\nCuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla in a recent G77 and China meeting\r\n28:00\r\nput the necessary figure to between 3.3 and 4.5 trillion dollars a year.\r\n28:07\r\nI say that nothing short of 10 trillion dollars a year will do. Are these feasible numbers?\r\n28:14\r\nYes, they are technically, of course they are. Imagine a repurposed World Bank,\r\n28:19\r\nbacked by a digital world currency - currency unit, like the SDRs -\r\n28:27\r\nissued by a repurposed International Monetary Fund, where the deal is, internationally,\r\n28:33\r\nthat all capital and trade flows are denominated in this currency unit and 10% of those flows are converted\r\n28:43\r\ninto green investments especially in the Global South. Technically it is straightforward,\r\n28:49\r\nhowever, politically it's not. Green Keynesianism will fail\r\n28:56\r\nfor reasons that Michał Kalecki, for those of you who remember Michał Kalecki from the 1930s and 40s,\r\n29:02\r\n- Polish marxist economist - explained so vividly when he was criticising Keynesianism.\r\n29:08\r\nWhat he said was this: Even if the bourgeoisie panics and adopts Keynesian policies to save its own skin,\r\n29:16\r\nthe moment those policies begin to work, the first four or five minutes,\r\n29:21\r\nthe bourgeoisie will ditch these policies and will go back to its own extractive, exploitative policies,\r\n29:27\r\nbecause - let's face it - it is in the capitalist class' nature to block the very road that leads to its own salvation.\r\n29:37\r\nWhich means only one thing. That to implement the necessary Green Keynesian policies,\r\n29:44\r\nwe must do something that Keynes would have hated: Dismantle the Global Empire of Capital,\r\n29:52\r\nwhich prefers to see the end of the world, than the implementation of the Green Keynesian policies\r\n29:58\r\nthat could prevent the end of the world. Now, how do we do that?\r\n30:05\r\nWell, nothing short of a revolution will do comrades! It's really very simple. Now, that may sound like an impossible dream.\r\n30:12\r\nWell, it is a prerequisite for saving humanity,\r\n30:18\r\nexactly the same way that we were taught by Fidel and by all those leaders of the progressive movements of the past.\r\n30:27\r\nHow do we do it? Our revolution must use the technology of Big Tech.\r\n30:33\r\nTheir cloud capital, in order to cooperate and in order to activate our campaigns across the board internationally,\r\n30:44\r\nin a coordinated and effective fashion. A first step, the Progressive International has shown the light to:\r\n30:53\r\nEvery year, every December, the Progressive International organises a strike against Amazon:\r\n31:00\r\nMake Amazon Pay (makeamazonpay.com) And how should that be? Well,\r\n31:07\r\nto reclaim its plundered Commons: our lands, our oceans, the air,\r\n31:14\r\nvery soon outer space, they are privatizing it. I don't know whether you know that, they are doing it already.\r\n31:20\r\nThere are two things we need to do internationally. We need to legislate so that corporations belong to those who work in them\r\n31:27\r\non the basis of one person - one share - one vote and we need to deny banks the monopoly on payments.\r\n31:36\r\nBanks and profit will then wither as our economies\r\n31:42\r\nwean themselves off share markets and the financial sector.\r\n31:48\r\nAt the same time, profit and wages are no longer meaningful concepts,\r\n31:54\r\nsince everybody will be a shareholder in the company in which they work.\r\n31:59\r\nThis simultaneous death of the market for shares and of the labour market,\r\n32:04\r\nalong with the defanging of banks, will automatically redistribute wealth,\r\n32:10\r\nmake it possible to offer a basic income to everyone and, as a magnificent byproduct,\r\n32:17\r\nremove the major incentives to war.\r\n32:22\r\nThe end of capital's power over society will allow communities collectively to decide health provision, education and investment,\r\n32:30\r\ninvestment in saving the environment from our virus-like growth. Genuine democracy would only then become possible,\r\n32:39\r\nto be practised in the workers assemblies and in the citizens assemblies, not behind closed doors where oligarchs meet.\r\n32:48\r\nThis twin democratisation of money and capital sounds like an impossible dream, doesn't it?\r\n32:56\r\nBut I submit to you, comrades, it's not more impossible or it doesn't sound more impossible\r\n33:02\r\nthan once the idea of one person - one vote, of the end of slavery, of the end of the divine right of Kings sounded.\r\n33:10\r\nThis twin democratisation is nothing short of a precondition for the survival of us as a species,\r\n33:20\r\nit is that simple. Those are the tasks of the New Non-Aligned Movement\r\n33:26\r\nwe must now build. Its ultimate purpose: To end the legalised robbery of people and planet\r\n33:35\r\nwhich is fuelling climate catastrophe. Nothing less than the total vanquishing\r\n33:41\r\nof capital's authority over human societies can end depravity and save the planet.\r\n33:48\r\nComrades, friends, this is not a drill and it is not a pipe dream.\r\n33:53\r\nWe can pull it off. Together! Thank you.

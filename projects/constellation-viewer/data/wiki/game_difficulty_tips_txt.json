This includes options such as slowing the game speed, grating yourself invincibility or infinite stamina, and skipping chapters entirely. - Celeste was designed to be a challenging, but accessible game. We believe that its difficulty is essential to the experience. We recommend playing without assist mode your first time. - However, we understand that every player is different. if Celeste is inaccessible to you due to its difficulty, we hope that assist mode will allow you to still enjoy it. - Would you like to play with Assist Mode? Yes/No\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/game_difficulty_tips.txt.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, feature, gameplay\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.114Z",

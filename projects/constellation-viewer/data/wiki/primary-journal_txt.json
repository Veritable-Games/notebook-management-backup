Your lives go on and I miss so much. Life's taken me so far and I can only see myself continuing to grow my relational abilities and going forward on projects as a means of expression. There are a great many things my life has taught me in recent years I feel you all may benefit from. My only saying on it here is it that I haven't always been afforded moments to talk to you all. There are so many friends I've missed out on and so many people that have gone without attention I would now be so willing to give. People are most important in my life overall, but the places we live, the ways we connect to each other, all of the systems that be, and how we've grown to err in such harmful ways. The damage we do to each other, the trauma shared by this pale blue dot. I believe that all of it, all of it is broken. This world is so far from the ideal I'm setting myself out to espouse through my works. The life we live is so very broken and the only way I know how to contribute to it being fixed is to create, to work towards my greatest potential for expression with those that share in my effort and time. mockDevelopers, mockEveryone It's my wholehearted belief that the works we set ourselves to contribute can matter the universe to us and to the people we share our lives with. What we create, what we do, how we spend our time; we've bonds to the other that propel us into the future, and I think it's the effort of a great many people that are making this world a better place. -- I will make amends and do so much more to keep you all in my life as soon as I have the span for such attention. For now I must work, the thing I want to set out to create will be all I need to move forward into the future myself. The job I'm at now will never set my brain alight, the act of creation is such a wonderous thing I have let myself go without. -- If I can say things that are succinct. People matter most. We've only got so much time to create. Life should afford us the time and resources to give enough attention to all who we love. Do well to make friends and your heart will only grow. Give and give until you cannot. Know that I love you best I can. I will enable myself to love even more. --- All said, I will be taking the time I have left past holiday to work, WORK, work, and work. Though, please, REACH OUT if you need me. I'll be away from home here in Nevada from the 14th until the 28th; will have my phone, maybe computer in the moments I have to reflect on projects. \n6:17 PM]Glitch: selfish is what I am\n[6:17 PM]Glitch: my outwardness to be selfless is incredibly intentional. I've developed drivers that center my attention to people\n[6:18 PM]Glitch: can I move myself to be selfless for the betterment of others and put myself aside?\n[6:18 PM]Glitch: I have done so much wrong to people and I will never be able to fully amend for the loss of would be love.\n[6:19 PM]Glitch: I   want  to give, like nothing else it is the thing that gives me hope for the future. The act, willingness, wanting severely so to give.\n[7:42 PM]Glitch: people are my wanting in life\n[8:09 PM]Glitch: mockEveryone I am so sorry for the ill-considered and terribly contrived message that was intended to find heart to you all before; I am far from prepared to engage you all like that. -- I only reach out once more like this because it is inwardly important to me that my motivation isn't lost to you all. People are my motivation to life, you all have meant so much to me in the time shared. -- It is a deep feeling that anyone, that you, as the person reading this, will not want for anything I am so compelling myself to make unless you have concise, clear expectations of what it is I want to build. No matter of my hope for the future or for people; for family, for friends. --- I've been pouring the only soul I have at my disposal to make sense of a wealth of tangentially related notes and ideas, and so many wonderful recent experiences towards life; into what I aspire myself to make into patterns of clear themes; feelings that have yet to translate to goals on production towards the game. ---- My writing, as it is now, only holds purpose to me; there are greater wants for this creative work I am only able to recognize on my own so I must work to clearly demonstrate the expectations for what it is this thing is supposed to be. -- I am putting forward these incredibly wild but interrelated ideas on a template given to me by Anarco; the doc has given me an outline to work towards and I can be nothing but thankful for his attentiveness to it and the consideration of others to search for an understanding in it. --- To only say one thing to explain recent happenings, I am putting myself to focus on a revived, shared, would-be project titled autumnMock and an old, previously commissioned on, long-tinkered and kept thougt to, dodecMock. In use to both, I am trying to make sense of an old, poorly-documented dialogue system I commissioned from mockMolgato that has relation to much of what I'm trying myself at. ---- I can only apologize for that everyone message once more and be thankful that I know so many of you personally. --  It is my active belief that I will be able to make this thing with whatever limited wit and time I've to afford it. I have gathered myself towards the act of creation; I've no doubts in my mind to our shared, human potential. -- To iterate, I am ashamed for such a thoughtless first message. I have so, very much more to consider before this would-be thing I want to make with friends finds groundedness and relation for you all. I see an incredible good in all the Earth brings to us and want more to recognize the need for imaginings on futures we can all find shared belief in. I am oh-so hopeful that you will come to seethe good in what I will aspire myself towards. developersMock I know I can contrive something worth your potential for greater creative time; it will take so much more effort from me, I am making progress. (edited)\n[9:01 PM]Glitch: No one, not the mentors I aspire towards, not my oh-so-dear friends and family, not the people I've put my effort to work with and commissioned, not a single-living soul will see the potential for good in the thing I am so compelling myself to make until I've given it the time I've set aside for so long. --- I say this to you all, and I insist again, that this thing, the thing I most want to put myself towards in life; I want to build an experience mockAutumn , and another, mockDodecthat afford us teachings on altruism, life and love, unlike any other game before it. --- I believe in my greatest of hearts that I've discovered the right experience to give my all to these supposed acts of creation. -- And I've said it another way, but I could give my all to 100,000,000,000 friends and continue to love them all the more. I cannot do well-enough to explain, but I have a confidence in my greater understanding of people; feelings of such incredible empathy and love for those in my life; I am so much of what I've come to believe; everything I've learned for myself, ideals and ideals to the benefit of others that I could not fathom to explain but am aspiring myself to. -- I have so much love to give and I want nothing more than to give you all what nascent learnings I've attained for myself. There is so much potential in the world to give, I can only do so well to put my best intentions forth and make something tangible of this hopeful dream. \n\n[3:57 PM]Glitch: I'm not feeling it, whatever it is I'm feeling. I wanted to reach out to someone to get conversation going I guess? I'm not sure why I'm waiting to express; I should be looking at this notepad, journal thing the, weird entry design bible thing. I've so many notes to organize in there. I'm being stupid and distracting myself with this searching for a creed, code, or whatnot. Idiot, I'm an idiot. Remember that, bring yourself to work.\n[3:59 PM]Glitch: I think I'm looking for affirmations of sorts from people. I have not received any of the imagined gratitude I had faulty expected for myself. Now I am searching for this same, nigh unconscious feeling of it in other people.\n\n7:12 AM]Glitch: [So, my madness towards creation will be nigh understandable unless I try to explain the motivation towards it. There's been a lot going on in my life; I feel as if I am finding a voice and I could do well to explain a lot of the divers that have left me distracted and illcontented for so long. -- I have so far compelled myself to share so much in effort to other people, wasted, wasted so much time to myself. I am as insane as  we often find ourselves in  I recognize that people can  become so incredibly broken and I see the small but albeit broken systems that bring me closer to people and keep me to the strange and irrational absurdities to life; I am moving myself,  carrying  others of  times influence to me as  as though holding to mind the lives of each   people to life stand as  greater that  those supposed giants throughout history. I am moving myself into one of the drivers that brings us to life; ego-be-damned, I am to share   as we all compel ourselves to do for one another  the greatest we can give to people  contribution to greatest loves of life. I am compelling myself to write on and share one of the hopeful things we can put ourselves to; if so very fortunate of we to create; I  have such hope and love of people, I will forward motivate myself to  recognize that before us people are finding themselves for more  towards others and better to themselves.  The so-going, on-scribing history so forth and long past us; we've nothing but time to leave  all we can for  others in our life. The great potentiality,   our greatest yearnings for the soul to give out all we can to those we love.  I want, I am able to compell myself to bring out from works   standing of giants  old and unrecognized to me,  so  much is a remix  and the things we create are built   shouldered to everything else, I can bring forth from my own experience,  and so shoulded greater  in mind to you all by comparison to anything history has afforded me to my ignorance.  I can only love for people  in my life and those that contend themselves with my time. I have such   illcontrived but  incredible, warm to wishing ways to life. If I am to believe anything in life, I belive that it's through our imaginings, love of people, love for all what life brings; I would love nothing more to contribute my all to give e weight to our most incredible love for a wounder, most meaningfully beatiful future  so  longed of our longpast-souls to   want for. I want to give something to help us imagine better futures.]\n[7:19 AM]Glitch: [my contribution to us all in my work is done towards my hopes of  something far greater than me but so much greater for  the world. I think, though  my own   funnily broken schemas for   the understandings of people  are still so, surely  contrived themselves. illunderstood  people hold    such great  far, from my  most fullest-understood    needs and to my  most given experience, the needs and attributions of love I find from other people.] I left this in the dev-chat. not sure what I was going to make of it but I  finished  the thought   as I could bring myself to. \n[7:22 AM]Glitch: Tenant 1 - \"If I am to I hold myself to purpose it ought to be holding dear of others\"\n[7:33 AM]Glitch: There's a key to getting   the right outlet for my brain but I tend not to recognize it.  I so want to share what I have to say with others but I  know there's   among other things not all I can do to bring them to my heart well enough. My dad,    the works of  Seneca   so  hopeful to myself   , the  affordances I have are wonderful and I have yet to recognize their potential   to help us. I am ego tripping to think I might help the world with my imaginings.\n[7:41 AM]Glitch: there are strange workings of ego in this book that contest with my best   attention to   how they  word themselves. I cannot bring easy    or sufficient explanation of it to friends so I'm   using the outlet to find   some purpose to  the thought.\n[8:54 AM]Glitch: I haven't recognized my own potential to bring forth ego to friends,  I have done  damage to  Leo of sorts  with something  I had written to him. Now it's with this writing here that I'm thinking to him.  I am  of   wanted great security in my friend.  There is something broken in my mind to   the potentiality for love in others.  Though I write with him  in mind, implicitly now,   and I should think to   how 'you' will read this, should you accept my invitation to something so insane. I have not-re-read what is written here. It scares me  so, but I believe that you could incredibly find heart in what I have written.  [It's so incredibly interesting, but I've misspelled beautiful   and now I want to edit it but I refuse. So important.]\n[8:56 AM]Glitch: The thing. The hope, the dream I have set my deterministic mind to.  I  am still thinking to write to you, Leo. Unsure if  this writing would be  enough to amend things I cannot say  to your exacting presence  of mind.  Very interesting. I think it's incredible, these workings of the mind. So many thoughts to resolve if I press it against the ether of things  I've so set myself against.\n[10:46 AM]Glitch: Tenant 2 - Pause a moment, take in such deep breath so that you may take in all that is in your awareness. Be mindful of the clear ice beneath your feet or you will slip against your standing; hold face to others and console their worries. \n[2:35 PM]Glitch: Tenant 3 - You only need to ask, so be it to yourself or to others.\n[2:36 PM]Glitch: Tenant 4 - Tend more to see yourself and reflect on the presence of those around you; do all you may to recognize another's needs; see in them the greatest good of humanity \n[10:03 PM]Glitch: Left this horrible thing in the ⁠cat-preserve channel. (Okay, this block of my dumb process did not bring me closer to actually reading the dang text. I'll come back to the work as soon as I've eaten, maybe lose focus to a different work for a while. -- Seneca's stuff still comes back to me and I feel so much unexpected draw towards it.) Leaving this here because I don't want to lose it. If there's readings you all may glean from the limited information here, feel free to bring on your own rhetoric on it.)\n[10:18 PM]Glitch: Tenant 5- It's that so joyous of work which we find ourselves in; those that are and have been so enabled  to that of our most  incredible drivers. In the works and our greatest of givings, we find in them contentment; awe to bring forth our bliss in creation. Of iteration, to amend and  correct for sake of clarity to others. Mind the death of said authors and know that you too will die. \n[10:29 PM]Glitch: Tenant 6 - Intent to others is what's most crucial.\n[11:14 PM]Glitch: Tenant 7 - It's those that have, and are, affecting us to the greatest undertakings in our life;  time and  will shared is of all ours to behold.\n[12:56 AM]Glitch: Tenant 8 - Find reason to give much more to others; seek to adhere the motive of your greatest actions to people; share the weight towards your dreams for life.\n[2:30 AM]Glitch: I might espouse such incredible, idealistic thinking but then I cannot do well enough to move myself to work. It is unbecoming of me want to so greatly for others but so sinful to then be so terribly unable to create for the sake of others. [I see that I am] llcontented to rest the mind; I write towards feelings it goes un-abridged to [those] I am trying to bring closer to my most wanted understanding of the self and the world. \n[10:49 AM]Glitch: I have pulled some text from the description of a photo of Cthulhu. I believe it's seen as too needy against the would-be love of others. Strange to imagine those seeing my love of this cat as less-than, against the love of people. [...] \"There were greater considerations I wanted for him in our use of [this transport], people gave thought to contest against his being  freely available to the floor   if people were around, though it was said to us so very late at night  with him wandering  to his  own freedom late last  night.  We walked together on the passenger car, all I put myself to his being enabled to walk around was that he  not go off into an area they had sectioned off for the night. Though, I felt comfortable letting him explore  when I felt he understood the boundaries, he  kept upstairs, away from the enclosed space.  I may be far to lower myself to the expectation he would not go down there, and may only suggest better affordance if more passengers would bring their own, likewise family. -- I was requested, to my admiration, though chagrin to one of [the train's] attendants , that we  were to  have him in a harness and confined to his carrier. [I did what I could let him wander again later with the harness woefully rigged to him.] Before a while he sat back again with me to  abide by my wanting to stay, though  later I could only imagine for his wanting to see more.  [We had good rest in the passenger car between  my  checking on his needs for use of the litter box I'd made up for him. [I've yet to attain the right box for it, but it was easy enough to attend to other needs presented for food and water.] Cthulhu had a good journey, though there were  better creature comforts for space I wish I could have afforded him.  I was instructed to have him to seats with such animosity. I was asked  twice without explanation; my asks and  the  welcoming  to him from a I made were ignored in the  poor rhetoric.\" \n[11:42 AM]Glitch: Tenant 9 - We are so limited by that given love from people \n[11:49 AM]Glitch: I have removed further text on my regard of Cthulhu. I see in myself the small atrocities committed in my withholding of his soul.\n[11:49 AM]Glitch: \"[to the pets] those whom we find such  great relation  for. Of history,  so divided are you all to my  friend  and not all yours, you'd think him more kindly if  you were to spend time  to his attention. It feels good and joyous to my heart for me to have you all see my love for him here, though the  form before was illcomposed and I am sorry for the iterations.\"\n[3:14 PM]Glitch: This was taken from a message to dearest Dylan (Fang) I believe that I've greater amendments to make to my continually improving behavior; I feel that there is so much more to reconcile before I'd go as far to rely on software for illcontrived routines. \n[4:16 AM]Glitch: Tenant 10 - No greater wills preside over us. Do all you will to mind yourself to; all that which you hold dearest of heart. \n[4:16 AM]Glitch: Tenant 11 - The good fortune and thus- great suffering of all is only best understood by our searching and finding those [most truthful] of all our hidden drivers. \n[6:10 AM]Glitch: Tenant 12 - To repeat a work without then acknowledging our own withholdings; to deflect, outright object, or not give most word to those in discourse, is to our most-reduced- betterment. \n[5:18 PM]Glitch: Tenant 14 - Do not to get carried away in your own falsitities; give your best care of others and afford them to weight to listen. \n[3:48 PM]Glitch: Tenant 15 - broad strokes will take you nowhere if you can't imagine for yourself a path; give your greatest patience for your lack of knowledge. \n[6:31 PM]Glitch: It's odd when I can't yawn to satisfaction, though as tired and wanting for it as I am. I think it comes of a certain contentment.\n\n[7:26 AM]Glitch: I've such a great ask of you, LN. Matters of design applicable to life.\n\nTo go greatly contest the severe expectations of what we ought to owe to work; those unseen and unheard consequences to society's deprivational violence. How can better share of broken systems of attainment between us.\n\nI recognize that those presiding over us have no recognition in what it takes of. We need better amenable asks of our time; it's difficult to maintain a fairness in what we need of those that labor with us against the expectations of the company.\n\nIt's my belief and developing understanding that this work goes against our greatest wills to life. \n\nThat the severity of consequence, as it stands, is of more detriment to ourselves than we could think to reconcile; a system so normalized that we couldn't think to amend it. \n\nSo much wasted good will in their firing of my best of friends such wasted intent to work. Then this incredible, illcontrived notion of what it is we owe this organization.\n\nIf I see any way forward, it would be to abolish this system and replace it with something more equitable to the benefit of my coworkers and all those friends that I have shared time there with. To my dearest hearts of those we've lost to this broken system and how it neglects us. \n\nThe system, what they so name it; occurrences, points, the arbitrary thresholds that [would-so] separate us from labor we may so otherwise want to keep. Unfair attitudes and incredible expectations of time and commitment that make no sense in understanding in the most honest wants of us to continue.\n\nThis system imposes indirect threats of violence that set us against the larger wills of society; should we [so be forced] from the work. There are actors in my company not so far removed that [set themselves] to these consequences with a button press. \n\nWe may only suggest to abolish it and bring forth a more equitable replacement. In the place I work there would be no chance for unions or enough solidarity among the most-atomized of friends and those I've come to know- no chance for us to see to it that we [withhold our labor]. Where I work gives no chance of picket lines and the atomization of Americans give such slim hope solidarity for [in] change. I may only suggest a new system that holds [all of us] to greater heart [and trust]. -As it stands, the system [in place] is too severe against [our better wills].\n\nI tried so hard to give weight to it in a long, drawn-out conversation with that supervisor; he lent me knowledge of so many of his most grieved of experiences. The company would not give him time to find hope again; so imposing their cold will without recompense or thought to the inhumane misgivings that this system puts on us. \n\nBeing pointed out is all too easy if the worst of days comes to us or the most willful wants for escape arises.\n[7:36 AM]Glitch: As it stands, this thing is inhumane. Giving us no recognition of what we may need to attend to or want of outside of work. My company contracts people at twice the expense they pay [us] until they see to it to hire us. Twice the expense to bring opportunities to people there. I see it as a needless waste to separate someone from the company so severely when those supposed bad days or greater expectations of life and our own wills prevents us to. \n\nAll of it goes to time; the systems I'm so trying to imagine. Time as incentive, then so consequent. \n\nWe need people, hands to the labor, but only so many new people hold themselves to it. My supervisor suggested at first that they should hold their own to themselves. And I believe that thinking is wrong. The gist of it, we came to a good understanding and what's to be made as alternative to the point system that exists. It would only take individual considerations; a developing trust in those we work with. I still can't suppose how to incentivize but it's my hope that if you understand the whole of these problems you may recognize a solution therein.\n\nWe cannot lose consequence, but we must create good incentive. And to my immediate thoughts it goes to distribution of time and asks of those able and willing to come work. It's my thinking that if we have a butt if we have an abundance of trusted hands will not need something so decisive acting against those with most wholehearted intent to work.\n\nSo, incentives of time. My supervisor brings to light the known potential of people not to care. And those acting in greater greed for their own hands without regard to those they give labor with. The thing I want to ideate on should afford better expectations of work. I need to put forward reasonable constraints they don't set such a incredible threshold against us. \n\nI wish I had a background and greater interest in mathematics or better game design chops so this would come forth much easier. I can only think to a few options for opposing pressures. Though it almost feels terrifying, for I don't want something that I am able to propose to bring so much harm like what came before it. \n\nI want to imagine keeping hold of everyone that works there for as long as they choose. Doing away with the points entirely. For the threat of loss of work and the graduating pressure trips us up. To my greatest hope, we would be able to come to work whenever we so need it. It's a fear of his my supervisor that people would abuse this, and in a way I know to happen. We can't trust all our coworkers will want to give equal weight to the labor they bring. So there needs to be either a great incentive or less severe consequence. Though the only two things I can think of as variables are wages. Then there is the fact that we may have an overabundance of people on a given shift. How might we incentivize some to leave to give room for others to work? It could be transplanting the guarantee of hours into the next month. Or temporaries of l I'm of wages. Though we all deserve a baseline of ours and earnings. Oh, this is so difficult. I only wish I knew better to how games wait variables so I could have design for the best incentives and most reasonable outcomes. A lot of it has to do with how much they're willing to give to work. Both in time and effort during the hours we labor. Suppose this, someone gives a lot of time and effort; we either guarantee them more hours or maybe raise their wage for a section of time; temporarily temporarily incentivize their continuation of work without holding over them severe separation. Hire so many hands and there will no doubt be enough to have labor from. So then goes the issue to incentivize extra people to leave. I am sorry for this wall of text and it for being so terribly contrived. I don't know how to best see it through that these systems are changed and our relation to the labor that holds us.\n[7:36 AM]Glitch: Oh damn. I would suggest talking more to my supervisor outside of work to find conclusion in this, but he says he's not allowed to spend time with us in that way. I think you may still find difficulty in what I'm putting out. It was so easy to talk to him and negotiate what could be though I could not still think to a greater system. It hurts to imagine taking time away. Or being so withholding of it people are in incidental need. Suppose anyone can come in at any time. We could give them temporary bonuses to wage that resets in intervals; give more time and you get a temporary boon. Give less and the boon is reduced in that subsequent interval. Let those that work here come and go as they so choose; give as much as they are able, spend for their time better- so as long as we have enough hands I don't think we'll ever be lacking. I don't want to see so many that I have come to know be forced out by the company because life goes on without greatest regard of work.\n[7:36 AM]Glitch: I may have to come back to this tomorrow. I am so sorry to leave you with so much for unrefined text. All I could think to do was ideate on this. I'm only that much closer to a solution. I so greatly need another mind to contribute. It's my hope that your knowledge of game design could bring to life gamification on incentives and then drawbacks to what people want and can output to the labor. Not being so severe the consequence if they cannot give as much as the company expects them to. Having enough hands to where we are never needing; but affording those that work with us the greatest freedom to life.\n[7:36 AM]Glitch: It cost them double to hold a contractor. If we can bring everyone to full hire, they would save expense, and that I believe is part of the argument. But I couldn't put this to mathematics and how it's balanced. The shifts have available wages; more at night less in the day. If we were to receive raises in these intervals I could suppose that it would amount to a bonus at the end of the month or interval that works best. If each shift has a percentage bonus, variable to the expectation of what time is committed (and arbitrary in some ways). Let's suppose that more hours give yield to growth of those bonuses. Resetting an intervals as I said. So not to give permanent growth at greater cost to the company and further disparity of coworkers. The baseline should still have raises, likely depending on whatever system was implemented before, but I think it's through incentives of time given and the temporary boons in each interval that would give weight to people collectively giving enough time to the work. It would take a certain level of trust to see that every person is wanting of this. Even greater effort to see that they don't abuse something given so freely. The only disincentive in not coming to work would be that you lose on paid hours and that temporary boon.\n[2:53 PM]Glitch: I'd like to form a thesis to music. How is it the intonation carries so much information information across to us. If you hear a conversation spoken a language that you do not know, would you be able to glean feeling from the words being expressed between the ones talking?\n[2:54 PM]Glitch: Does it follow that music is an unintended reading of these abstract knowings of communication between other humans? It would give reason to the fact we feel emotion in our listening to it.\nJanuary 9, 2023\n[2:20 AM]Glitch: I have breakings in ways of inhibitory externalizations; if I have no one to speak to in much of my day and find no greater contentment on my own, I will put out small wants of will that are overburdensome to others in my life. I see this now.\n[2:54 AM]Glitch: [systemic governance] of the thing, how do I demonstrate further of the idea that the world we've so much fortune to drives us in deterministic ways? Of that in leadership, authority from other people in ways we could not do enough to recognize without content; authority that also goes to ideas of [obedience] and [ownership] of another. I do not know how to talk on these things and the text is very difficult. I own Cthulhu, in the way that I hold him to me; he not be so willing to ask on that which he may-so want. I want to give you all re-affirmations that I love [this cat]. (I think too technical and it's difficult to see my love through this text).\n[2:58 AM]Glitch: [governance, accomplished through systems of continual debt; inhibitorily-organized governance which is taking too much of us; to the benefit of those so far removed from us that we do not know them]—those so holding of so much of what it is we value in our actions of [labor] in attainment of things, entertainment; misaligned affordances for other people, (money) and, if we can so afford it, the end of our time.] (edited)\nJanuary 10, 2023\n[4:40 PM]Glitch: This one is terribly difficult. Soliloquy gives reason if we're able to communicate with one another. If I am to regard people that are far away, I set myself to thinking on them, not knowing what they may be thinking; not seeing enough that I myself am able to understand them, why does it go to follow that I cannot  'act' on myself in focus without knowing all of the others I keep attention to. \n\nI am unable to ask because I cannot give  to myself in a way.

I cannot bring out the dearest of gratitudes for people. Most credit to Seneca for the term of beneficence and such expression for how we ought to incur gratitude.\n\nThough I try as hard as I've expressed [and there are selfish drivers, internally; so do not believe the will despite loss or lack- internal drivers keep us from not depressing ourselves so much as to end the love for self] These Earthly drivers are systems of graciation by recourse of loss to self; much imposition of will through systems of higher stress to us; hierarchy at large and what we owe to the value-driven debts that are imposed. That bit was less philosophy and more 'what is' [in terms of the systems that order above us]. The Earthly drivers keep us grounded to people and set us to motion among our peers. \n\nSystems of graciation go further to maintain the bonds to people and allow us to [hold-strength] to ourselves. We must give pride to ourselves, hope to others, reassurance in acceptance. Such a word as Love goes with incredible difficulty, but if the drivers that make us, the thinly woven fabric of humanity has done done well enough to not unravel.

We are self-amending; self-forwarding, not self-aware till we've reconciled with (the text going forward). Words do not withhold information unless they're given to function of context. I can say anything if I put myself forward to it; the idea of consciousness is false. We are not built to be self aware, we are built to be self-amending. \n\nIf our ideas of [consciousness are broken], how is it that we would see to it that text is 'corrected' against our withheld deterministic; value-reflective, drivers? \n\nI think it follows [from my pooridiot reasoning] that these drivers may go on to clarify to themselves [on] things that [we] were already submitted; only-thus self-recognized in subsequent moments; [later-related to others]. (LN) It only follows, [that I; have to be sure nobody hates me, so I need to amend further; because this is immensely difficult text] Please, do see that you are well. Please know that if I knew your problems, that I could give as much as I might myself to—though my ignorance to the world and limited love from life [I] can only give outward enough to help who I am enabled to. \n\nIf I could give you everything I would give you myself. But I must keep to this effort and explain. Please know that I care; this is difficult text to read, and you will find so much contention in my saying this wonderous thing. We are not self-aware or more present in a given-moment. It's the consequences of language that give us the falsely-contrived idea of consciousness.\n\nThis thing, language can only go forward. If we are to [recognize] ourselves in expression it's in these, all-but small, nigh-subdermal, almost unrecognizable ways; so much distracted from us, from those we ought to care for. If we are aware of ourselves, we can amend further than you may ever imagine possible. Reattribution of what's learned to the next moments that's passed. We  are [not] unique because we can [reconcile what's passed]. You must see (to the idea) that life may only go foward; amendments are not made by 'consciousness' but the awareness of what's being forwarded against past-recognition. As related beneficence [are these drivers] we are inherited by Nature in deterministic ways.\n\nIf I am to proclaim what this is to be. This thing, my dumbfuck idea of what it is to be to [each other] in our many variegated; —Nature-driven becomings done through the changes seen in spans of time unknown to us; we are Homo sapiens and those that would call us family are far-distanced by such incredible time. Not a theory of everything, but a theory of us. If I may say on my own accord for what this is to be. We ought to name it rightly for all that are not distinctly human; though of [this same] shared earth.

I’ve the ambition to see it as something that might help me say more on this odd philosophical proof; a working-hypothesis I’ve been writing out on the channel. People are capable of incredible things, and I think it’s through this project I may afford people an idea on how they may give better. \n\nOf Ego and original sin; the machinations of these values we are so ascribed at birth; of learned behaviors gained through facets of environment, nutrition, our-bodies; nurture from people, of attention, want for the self, of others that we would be-driven to know; Of Love and those that we would hold so readily in our minds; the distance of those many in our lives. Of all drivers related; we are consequently doing [amendments] of what goes [from these] internalized systems—everything which affects us; these [inherited] things of felt|shared relation and values which force-us comparison. Of Jealousy and ‘wanting’; these of our most selfish drivers endure to affect us; amend that which goes on to relate ourselves to others, all in ways that would hold us to the Ego and those enduring values. \n\nIf we are to ‘amend unto acts’ of beneficience, and do-so rightly we [must-know] ourselves and [imagine] a brighter, wholly-optimistic idea of how these systems of knowledge, language, rhetoric, relation, soliloquy, and then the weird anomaly of song—we ought to know that [all life] operates on deterministic strings; we are not separate from that of Nature and the earth we’ve such boon of. If I am to espouse these values of ‘my own’; I am not but one. If any of you would take this to reflect on yourselves and impart these [supposed values].\n\nI must say one thing; we ought to remove ourselves from need; these systems of graduating benefits and returns. The ones that go awry, break upon themselves; these are the ones that lead to the enduring social malaise.

These recent works milk and honey; and home body are revealing to me in the ways our cultures have systemized ideals of what we ought to be for each other.

We are-but self-amending and thus, self-forwarding, not self-aware [...] We're only able to reconcile with what's been [said] related to [things of the] past. We are not able to amend so readily in the moment. —(You) must see to it that you reconcile with (the text going forward). It's through this developing model [of mine] that you will find; words do not withhold information unless they're given to function of context. [Of my own first-person driver to write] I can say anything if I put myself forward to it; the idea of consciousness is false. We are not built to be self aware, we are built to be self-amending.\n\nIf our ideas of [consciousness are broken], how is it that we would see to it that text is 'corrected' against our withheld deterministic; value-reflective, drivers? \n\nI think it follows [from my pooridiot reasoning] that these drivers may go on to clarify to themselves [on] things that [we] were already submitted; only-thus self-recognized in subsequent moments; [later-related to others]. (LN) It only follows, [that I; have to be sure nobody hates me, so I need to amend further; because this is immensely difficult text] Please, do see that you are well. Please know that if I knew your problems, that I could give as much as I might myself to—though my ignorance to the world and limited love from life [I] can only give outward enough to help who I am enabled to. \n\nIf I could give you everything I would give you myself. But I must keep to this effort and explain. Please know that I care; this is difficult text to read, and you will find so much contention in my saying this wonderous thing. We are not self-aware or more present in a given-moment. It's the consequences of language that give us the falsely-contrived idea of consciousness.\n\nThis thing, language can only go forward. If we are to [recognize] ourselves in expression it's in these, all-but small, nigh-subdermal, almost unrecognizable ways; so much distracted from us, from those we ought to care for. If we are aware of ourselves, we can amend further than you may ever imagine possible. Reattribution of what's learned to the next moments that's passed. We  are [not] unique because we can [reconcile what's passed]. You must see (to the idea) that life may only go foward; amendments are not made by 'consciousness' but the awareness of what's being forwarded against past-recognition. As related beneficence [are these drivers] we are inherited by Nature in deterministic ways.\n\nIf I am to proclaim what this is to be. This thing, my dumbfuck idea of what it is to be to [each other] in our many variegated; —Nature-driven becomings done through the changes seen in spans of time unknown to us; we are Homo sapiens and those that would call us family are far-distanced by such incredible time. Not a theory of everything, but a theory of us. If I may say on my own accord for what this is to be. We ought to name it rightly for all that are not distinctly human; though of [this same] shared earth. I would ask whom may read; carry these knowledges on against the imagined will of [mine], through language, of people dear, to those so far. I would only ask of [those] all that may read- I am only to say it so as Systems of Beneficence.\n[1:43 PM]Glitch: if the systems of operational hierarchy persist in our minds, we order ourselves in reversal of the forward; put ourself out, say we are not wanted (in a way), then put forward the thought (or action—though [this] may-be inhibited; the forwarding to ask of another is how we ground ourselves to eachother. If we set ourselves too far apart it goes to confusion, malice, distrust, and all the things that come with not understanding the 'other' that would endure against the will of our minds.\n[1:43 PM]Glitch: To soliloquy is to almost sing to oneself. If we don't know what to say, how to move forward, who to think on, when we're meant to do something, or why we ought to be. To have good systems on beneficence gives us opportunities to say on things; supposing you have been afforded the requisite language, given the opportunities for expression, and have had all the fulfilling moments needed for adequate reflection in time, how do [these systems of beneficence] [takes us] to [thought] reason and rhyme? \n\nIf is felt, and we've no one to share it with. If we have no one to bring into our hearth of conversation. — The behavior of song and self-soothing through soliloquy is almost like the inadvertent sharing of knowledge. \n\nThe way music relates is interesting, and our connections to it almost fill those gaps in otherwise potential expression of language; you may find you go easier to internalized thoughts if there is a nice ambient pattern or some music going you find particularly stimulating.\n[1:44 PM]Glitch: I [am forming] a sort of argumentative proof on the affects of migraines; something I believe we've false attributed to smaller variables. I see how severe these pains may be in others, though, I do not experience them myself.\n\nTo give context and clarity for my proposed proof, it would be of benefit to those that read this- that I go on to describe a few necessary terms and my own understanding of them. \n\nI need only to explain two terms for your best comprehension of this topic; even if you know them, please humor me. The words rhetoric and soliloquy; necessary to know for greater context, so that I may go further in adding weight to my abstract model here. I believe that we've falsely attributed the causation of these mental, thus physical pains.\n\nSo, just these two terms,\n\nRhetoric, as I understand it, is putting forth our best-felt knowledge and our fullest schemas. To convey information withheld in the mind to those we are talking to; best done when we are speaking out-of our greatest will. Rhetoric is sharing internalized models of the world with others. To be forthright about our own thoughts, and through them, seek-out the best understandings in others. It's these suppositions of knowledge which go on to create our concepts of the world. To explain outward our best reasonings to someone.\n\nSoliloquy, as I understand it, is giving forth that which is withheld in the mind, but different in-that it is explicitly expressed in perceived solitude; to speak out-loud with our most heartfelt, expressive potential; advancing our most-realized speech, or moving ourselves through anguage of which we would otherwise keep internalized; talking to oneself in the most sincerest of ways. To externalize, or vocalize which is most unexpressed, even despite our felt lack of company in the moment of communication.\n\nIt is of incredible recognition to my mind, through my own experience and time with others; though so-lacking are my own models of the world; though as grounded as I believe them to be, -that I've developed a model of this condition that discomforts so many of my friends. \n\nI may go further to describe what I think is happening to us with citations and research; which would give these concepts greater credence, buy it's my hope in this rhetoric that I may give weight to these ideas and then conclude on them.\n\nI see so strongly that we withhold ourselves from the greatest conveyance to others- consequence to how this society has shaped us. To say further, I see the act (learned behavior) of prayer as a sort of soliloquy in its own right; to give expression to those most withheld those thoughts, which may, [in greatest potential], soothe the mind.\n\nThe society we have been born into supposes that a person who speaks to themselves is crazy or somewhat maddened. Much of the 'soliloquy' we hear, is often partially withheld; full context all but known to that of the speaker.\n\nOf humanity's great telling of tales that were carried in speech over generations- we are orators by nature. We've such great ability to share ourselves through language. \n\nI believe we've misaligned our understandings of what it is the need to convey ourselves really proves to be. I see it as repression of our drives to communication. These incredible wants to give rhetoric and expression; further recognized as desire of emotional output and felt [acceptance] in others. \n\nAlthough we have weak attributions to what we suppose causes these internal pains, and such variation among our bodies and conditions, I believe it's these modern breakings that give hint to the so-often internalized damage that goes from our deepest retentions of the self. All to say, migraines are consequented by our unrecognized self-repression.\n[1:44 PM]Glitch: Do people fear what people [systems] would want of them? Of the things that would tie them to their values? We 'fear' against our own knowledge [in on-going evaluation of the self]; up against so many [internalized] systems of reflection. These [so-recognized], but amendable systems of expression are only [in] deterministic 'control of us'; we cannot choose our behavior, so much as recognize it. We may only go forward; in doing so amend any felt-wrongs.\n[1:46 PM]Glitch: [...]\n\nIf we are to ‘amend unto acts’ of beneficience, and do-so rightly we [must-know] ourselves and [imagine] a brighter, wholly-optimistic idea of how these systems of knowledge, language, rhetoric, relation, soliloquy, and then the weird anomaly of song—would bring about a world of greatest benefit to all those souls that would remain here. \n\nWe ought to know that [all life] operates on deterministic strings; we are not separate from that of Nature and the earth we’ve such boon of. If I am to espouse these values of ‘my own’; I am not but one. If any of you would take this to reflect on yourselves and impart these [supposed values].\n\nI must say one thing; we ought to remove ourselves from need; these systems of graduating benefits and returns. The ones that go awry, break upon themselves; these are the ones that lead to the enduring social malaise. \n[1:47 PM]Glitch: Of the thing of deterministic strings\nWe are self-amending; self-forwarding, not self-aware till we've reconciled with (the text going forward). Words do not withhold information unless they're given to function of context. I can say anything if I put myself forward to it; the idea of consciousness is false. We are not built to be self aware, we are built to be self-amending.\n\nThis will take great attention to those whom would read it, please know that I am unimportant. That this thing I've wrought below is for your betterment. If there are any knowledges you would like to share within—forward them.\n\nTo say on anything else I know, [...] as I believe language is meant to go.\n\nThese things of Beneficence are of great consequence to me; knowledges of mine are meant to be shared, as I think many of us would like to see ourselves do. The life that's ahead of us is not entirely our choosing; the weird behaviors, labels ascribed, the feelings of shame we may never be helped to recognize; those interior withholdings which may keep us from bettering ourselves. We are self-forwarding and thus, self-amending.\n\nI need say on hierarchy: \"We order ourselves in reversal of the forward; first, we put ourselves out, then imagine that we are not wanted for (in a way), set regard of the action or expression that was given; though, this may be inhibited.\" How we forward is cause of best relation or great distance between people. \n\nIf you are to work through your problems, see that you must give soliloquy and have discourse in yourself apart from others. If we are to process life rightly, there are strange inhibitions that hold us from language. If we do not have another is is most [imperative] that we talk to ourselves. We will not find growth keeping to solace; maintaining our so-prescribed atomization through isolation and the [wrong] wanting for what we 'ought' to attain [for ourselves] and those we would hold regard of.\n[1:47 PM]Glitch: Values are difficult. The things that hold us to people. If you do not know my heart, you would not know my intent. I've had great revelations on how I must set myself aside in these writings. — If I am to speak to you all, I must put aside the wants of [myself] and go on further to give knowledges which I believe will be of gain to you. If I may speak on any of my own [philosophical proofs] of human drives; Nature has afforded us 'felt-insight' to each other. We see our relations to people and then reflect on ourselves—holding-to those internalized systems of comparison and contrast to those that set us apart.\n\nThis text is so difficult. I am tired of explaining in so many ways. It will take my greatest effort to reexplain what it is that I would want you all to 'see'. And much more findings in my own search for knowledge to add. These Systems of Beneficence I will continue, [and try] to [give rhetoric on] are [my greatest aspirations]. — I am giving speech to say-on much of the things that we would not be born with [these intuitive, though behaved-learnings]. I write to bring clearer insight & thus [lend you] foresight of them. These acquisition of [behaved] values are found in relation of the self to others; to be selfish is to see your need for other people.

The imperfections and weirdness you still see are derived from my own text and its own given knowledges.\n[12:11 PM]Glitch: I asked \"Could you make this rhetoric more accessible in way of good readability and engagement?\"\nAnd grounded it, reduced the complexity to the phrasing below. The imperfections and weirdness you still see are derived from my own text and its own given knowledges. \n\nChat-GPT\n\"We need to change the way we interact with online platforms. Currently, these platforms are not designed to benefit us or provide us with knowledge that we would consider valuable. They are often controlled by corporations who want to sell us things, and this can limit our ability to engage in meaningful conversations and discussions.\n\nInstead, we need to create online ecosystems that are owned and operated by the users themselves. This could be done by funding public services like Twitter and YouTube in the same way that Wikipedia is funded. By doing this, we would ensure that these platforms are accessible to everyone, without being behind a paywall or limited in some other way.\n\nWe should be able to access information and engage in conversations online in a way that is free from corporate interruptions. The algorithms that drive these platforms should be designed with our best interests in mind, rather than being built to keep us engaged for as long as possible without any ethical consideration.\n\nUltimately, the ownership of these shared online platforms should not be in the hands of a single entity. They should be governed by the people who use them, and attuned to our best interests. By taking a more collective approach to these platforms, we can create a better internet for everyone.\"\n[9:03 AM]Glitch: removed from a google doc regarding the dialogue system\n\"This dialogue system has been an enigma in my life for nearly a decade and its in this document that I would finally compound on all my insights and instill in you a model for how it is meant to operate in the games. An ‘Enact’ is an abstraction of our real-world relational abilities and each of these ‘14’ symbols conveys a broad-type of emotion/expression/response: inherited behaviors.\"\n\nhere's ChatGPT's iteration:\nHere is the quick ChatGPT description:\n“The conversation system is intended to reflective of a person's driving systems of feelings, values, expressions, and emotions. There are 14 symbols that each convey a broad category of these things in our nature: referred to as ‘Enacts’. This unique system allows for emotionally rationalized; therein, rhetorical conversation between ChatGPT-driven actors. Each of the characters is driven by a system of values, biases; all to weighted task judgments, and has unique identities. These Enacts grant the player and characters discernible abilities in emotional conveyance between actors in the world.”\n \n[3:01 PM]Glitch: removed from ⁠Unknown \nI have a baseline we can start from and an abundance of Unity assets to draw on- if we find ourselves to a broad concept, then vertical slice; we could very well support ourselves. Those ones that decide they want to work with me. For comradery, we will have to build on trust to the project(s) we pursue. I think you'll be surprised at how quickly we'll be able to progress. \n\nShared goals go a long way. \n\nThis work I have in the background is not just the game project and ideas on Autumn, but these things I'm making and writing are meant to be lifetime pursuits. We may find stability in the product after it makes market, or maybe it blows out. We sell what we can and keep improving it. We sustain ourselves with finances enabled by it and then work on whatever else.\n\nGiven success- I would rather remain working on the thing, unless you all compel me to make something more.\n\nA friend was saying; just a discord status, but we tend not to recognize how others might not often notice our faults. These things, false ideals of [perfection]- the 'imposter syndrome' of not seeing yourself stand at the face of those other giants. We must see ourselves as so very important to the world; though it will endure to accelerate without us. (I give rhetoric here) See yourself in good value and we would have our dearest hearts to the self and those others. — We are about to be superseded in digital work by AI/AGI in everything.\n\nIn doubt, you may believe I am shouting that the sky is falling unto us; fears espoused 'for you'- at pronouncing it. \n\nIt is here. — The sky is falling and we are about to be outmoded in work by cost-effective systems & models that can do nigh everything we might in the digital realm. They are (will be) so capable of all digital work. These Rhetorical machines (AI), then AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) will become so incredibly prevalent and widely regarded. I must be intense.\nGlitch\n pinned \na message\n to this channel.

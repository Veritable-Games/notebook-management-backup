The only thing that I think matters to your may be held recognition of me the long lost thing of 'I' on these discussions [...] This ⁠rhetoric channel is the best spot for me to speak on these most held values. The ones of recognition to me; and I so think that  this is why the things of philosophy do not often so speak on things which may be of use to us. I can say that these things of language and knowledge are not a novelty to me nor should they be to anyone else. The thing of best clarity among others is variety of speech and recognition of the linguistic goal this writing would go to. \r\n\r\nMy thing of philosophy so ties to ⁠Unknown where I may try at less speaking to the abstract. More functional in my language. Here, my ideals are described in best clarity; though, please mind- much endures UNEDITED; and I will have to set these old writings against my best, most-present understanding of the text. I may do well to amend a thing or if it's so bad; remove the thing entirely \r\n\r\nI want to give us set proof for our right to life among all these much larger systems. There is confidence in me that suggests these ideas may give us a collective insight beyond what we already have in our own knowledge and the insights we have in this all shared human behavior. ||more to beliefs of our obligations to this thing of Nature and those would-be others we are so inherited to take care of. Greater understanding of what  we are. This thing of the human machine- our relational  purpose to 'the self' and so many others in our lives.\r\n\r\nIf I am to do anything with my time it is only these writings and the [functional desire to work] on ⁠Unknown. My own writing goes to this strange thesis in may ways, if I am to have any personal utility of language; though it should not have a name. It does in my mind's heart. The thing is 'systems of beneficence'; these greater relational and so important underpinnings of the human psychology and the still-incredible workings of our internal minds- then to our expressional relational abilities. To say more on the thing of language. If we are to say best we must see that the ones that we see of mind of are in clarity best recognition. \r\n[3:27 PM]Glitch:\r\nTo give soliloquies; sayings to oneself in the perceived isolation of one's mind is what I believe gives to those internalized thoughts that go unshared. Historied meaning of the word, speaks of its use in plays; wondering tonight in felt solitude. \r\n\r\nI think it's a unrecognized and potentially greatly beneficial tool that we must not see shame in. And it's my almost superstitious belief that these under-expressed wants of the mind which we do not seek to make externalized sense of; \r\n\r\n—So much we of which we set ourselves to withhold- gives weight to eventual damages in ways of neuroses or so resolved in mind to persist- migraines which pull us back and weigh against us. I need only to do research for my own enlightenment on these unknowings.\r\n\r\nWe have such great Fortune in our ability to recognize and give credence to those patterns which bring forth understanding- through ourselves and of others. Give weight to your own experiences and withholdings in life; I am but one philosopher in my beliefs he's incredible, though underutilized minds. You would do so well to give as best as you might yourself to. There are only unknown returns for your internalized self and those ideas you have so much potential to share with. \r\n\r\nIf I am to give rightly, if I am to give with such passionate intent to do good, I must see others. I see that I must not give so heedlessly; I am so severely wanting to amend for wrongs of giving that have been committed in recent days- to forward amend those past misgivings which I had not comprehended.\r\n \r\n[3:34 PM]Glitch: To a deeply valued friend, \r\n\r\nI think I must say on my own philosophies in life or else it goes without greatest potential benefit to others. —The ego holds weight to ourselves in way of comparison; then to want, greed, jealousy and the thing of much too regard for the self. \r\n\r\nThe 'I' affords us momentum towards reconciliations of things so driven and unknown to us. To my own beliefs of what we have been given by literal evolution & so-Nature, the sheer overwhelming potential of this so unlikely of minds. We've such incredible unseen possibilities to do so well for others in everything we see good in.\r\n\r\nGive all you can, give all you might yourself to, and it's through these externalized processes that go forthmay work for all of us in ways we may**have yet to fully see for ourselves.\r\n \r\n[3:48 PM]Glitch: @LittleNorwegians to my own misgivings to you, [archived as a letter]\r\nThese texts go on to give back in ways I could only imagine return.\r\n\r\nRegarding Seneca's history; \r\n[the strongmen of Rome and their correlation of our modern 'all-but' lawmen]\r\n\"During the civil wars that plagued the Roman state in the century before the fact that Seneca's strongmen [lawmen] inflicted proscription as a way to eliminate enemies. Someone who was 'prescribed'—that is, posted on a public may blacklist—could be killed by any citizen in exchange for a reward; as punishment ordained.\"\r\n\r\nOn proscription- \r\nThe [controllers of Rome used this method to solidify their control in the wars following Julius Caesar's assassination.\"\r\n\r\nOn the thing of being a Cynic, to a well-regarding friend\r\n\"Cynic philosophers disdained money and \r\nwent about in ragged cloaks, begging from\r\n passers-by.\" Britannica ref\r\n\r\nKnown for [their] \"unconventional way of life as for its rejection of traditional social and political arrangements, professing instead a cosmopolitan utopia and communal anarchism. —Socrates is considered to be the founder of the movement.

It seems we're born into inclinations of wanting; the wants given to us like a [tumorous] growth we have no control of. We're born, inherited to the traits that would arise in us a 0% chance that we would not want as others do. People are raised against the backdrop of those far removed from us; held to our minds, the imaginings of great wealth, the [thing of] money; to-get-, for ourselves that which we would [not otherwise] see ourselves to hold. \r\n\r\nIn these historied expectations of the might of [people unknown to us] and what they ought to [have] for themselves; the fairy-tale false images of these idols painted into our minds; consequent to our ideals for what we should have for ourselves in turn. We only see the extant results of these past-efforts; been told stories of how these systems are deserving of our faith, like trust in a religion and what these state powers should be to us. All unto this faultily-built thing of congress, the senate, the house, and this [absurd] thing of 'absolute' power in the presidency. \r\n\r\n[this stuff is being moved, not deleted]\r\n\r\nOf our historythat teaches us of the aspirations of all; the will to want so wholly for the things that we do not have—wronged ideals of how we ought to see ourselves to partners, in-permanence, in-exclusive solitude to each other in marriage; of the borned ideals of this thing; over hundreds of thousands of years, history unknown to us [such that half of our entire species had not been afforded abilities to write themselves into history] these crimes, severities that may have gone far against our [much more real] nature for each other.\r\n\r\n[for ourselves] and our shared time; these economic drivers are not affording\r\nour best potential for life. they set us in division of chasms unseen to us\r\n\r\n[more to add before this thing is of any value to anyone]\r\n\r\nthe thing I removed; and would have difficulty attesting to in such absolutes\r\nthe greatest workings of the soul; the mind that [set value] and hold us to people\r\nthe thing of the brain that gives us autonomy; the [systems we've been afforded]\r\nthese shared blueprints [DNA], epigenetics: those workings of the deterministic\r\nsystems in human behavior. - as said; difficulties in the expression. but as I might\r\n\r\nWe must abide by a unwritten social contract in our work. That of trust and the expectation that no one ought to contribute more than they feel they should. Do not be more-obligate than another.\r\n \r\n[4:09 PM]Glitch: If any of you would like a similar space to soliloquize\r\n[...] I so wish it that you are mindful of your own potential, to fully-see your own, set  wanting at expression, the desire to do more for yourself, and so I hope-, for all others. I would love for you to seek sharing those ideas and best givings that would otherwise go unrecognized or to [go-so] unwillingly unfulfilled. May you see you to it that thisidea of you* is held dear within your heart of hearts and [...] give all know; and recognize your Fortuities in life. Give rightly credence to those experiences that may go unshared. Keep iterating your kindest expressions.*\r\n\r\nI believe it's through the inner-workings and seldom- externalized processes of our minds  that we find most purpose and value in ourselves. It's often through our giving of the self that we so wantingly would love recognition of in others. I may have an ego, but it's in my best intent and [hope of hopes] in these soliloquized sharings of my limited self and experience, [that I wish to bring change; to my own ends, the good grace of whom may share my time.] \r\n\r\nOnly know, I have nothing in life but to [give my own.]\r\n\r\nin a bad letter to someone I meant to work with\r\nWe must put aside be selfish drivers and give to others as we may give to ourselves. I believe this thing may have great potential for good [should we do it rightly].\r\n \r\n[5:14 PM]Glitch: [this text has been amended for future clarity]\r\n\r\nSo far lost to us is the beauty of fuller expression. \r\nNo needs should so occupy our minds to inhibit the progress of our soul.\r\n\r\nTo talk to others of what bothers us. So prevailing are the problems of our lives and to plan for what we ought to do in our talks to others, is [to] soliloquize in another way [for] those that would hear us. \r\n\r\nWhat vocalizations came of prayer are of the same evolved needs we would have so sought out in times past. The telling of tales among our tribe; oration of learnings, experience and knowledge we'd been so wanting to give to others. To write things out soothes just as well. \r\n\r\nTalking to ourselves, though not always in so many coherent ways, is correlated in negation. Soliloquy is to ideate in a freedom; to solidify on our problems against our willful internal focus- to others, unknowable workings so-said that could not help others understand us.\r\n\r\nWe cannot choose to deafen our mind to the talking of those we hear and comprehend; we've no choice but to understand as we may; unless we have such incredible  focus on something we'd do; or be able to to tune to our minds to comparative, may-be likewise conversation.\r\n\r\nWhat I see in my own incomplete schema of things- to make sense of this thinking; the trauma I find in many is the inability to share in our, would-be-forced -internalized  workings. Of great, further consequence to breakings of the mind; thus our relation to ourselves and those others that may have us\r\n\r\nSevere migraines that come of [what I believe to be] expressive neglect. The small breakings we see in others, the misattributions of angers  within, and other, so-small to be unseen, idiosyncrasies that work against us; damage to our most repressed [want of life].\r\n \r\n[5:22 PM]Glitch: [these schemas go on unresolved but a work-in progress; goal of a thesis or epistle] \r\n[5:02 AM]Glitch: On the thing of migraines; for some reason\r\n\r\nI have formed a sort of argumentative proof on the affects \r\nof migraines; something I believe we've false attributed \r\nto smaller variables. I see how severe these pains may be in \r\nothers, though, I do not experience them myself. To give [my\r\nbest] context and clarity for this [working[ proof, it would \r\nbe of benefit to those that read this- that I go on to describe \r\na few necessary terms and my own understanding of them. \r\n\r\nI need only to explain two terms for your best intake on this\r\n[so important] topic; even if you do know them, [you may] \r\nstill humor yourself. The words rhetoric and soliloquy; necessa\r\n-ry to know for greater context, so that I may go further in ad-\r\ning weight to my abstract model here. I think that we've falsely \r\nattributed the causation of these mental, thus physical pains.\r\n\r\nSo, just these two terms,\r\n\r\nRhetoric, as I  [understood] it, is putting forth our best-felt knowledge and our fullest schemas. To convey information withheld in the mind to those we are talking to; best done when we are speaking out-of our greatest will. Rhetoric is sharing internalized models of the world with others. To be forthright about our own thoughts, and through them, seek-out the best under-standings in others. It's these suppositions of knowledge which go on to create our concepts of the world. To explain outward our best reasonings to someone.\r\n\r\nSoliloquy, as I understand it, is giving forth that which is withheld in the mind, but different in-that it is explicitly expressed in [realized] solitude; to speak out-loud with our most heartfelt, expressive potential; advancing our most-realized speech, or moving ourselves through language of which we would otherwise keep internalized; talking to oneself in the most sincerest of ways. To externalize, or vocalize which is most unexpressed; [given best rhetoric and purpose], even despite our [may be] felt lack of company in the mo-ment of oration through the most literal thing of speaking. Doing this thing of soliloquy would let you hold mind to a crowd of people; listen, and tell more on what you know, thinking further to consequential feedback of others. Doing it in solitude; you may find epiphanies, insights, and mini revelations. \r\n\r\n[....]\r\n\r\nThe society we have been born into supposes that a person who speaks to themselves is crazy or somewhat maddened. Much of the 'soliloquy' we hear, is often partially withheld; full context  all but known to that of the speaker.\r\n\r\nI see so strongly that we withhold ourselves from the greatest conveyance to others consequence to how this society has shaped us. To say further, I see the act (learned behavior) of prayer as a sort of soliloquy in its own right; to give expression to those most withheld those thoughts, which may, [in greatest potential], soothe the mind.\r\n\r\nOf humanity's great telling of tales that were carried in speech over generations- we are orators by nature. We've such great ability to share ourselves through language. \r\n\r\nI believe we've misaligned our understandings of what it is the need to convey ourselves really proves to be. I see it as repression of our drives to communication. These incredible wants to give rhetoric and expression; further recognized as desire of emotional output and felt [acceptance] in others. \r\n\r\nAlthough we have weak attributions to what we suppose causes these internal pains, and such variation among our bodies and conditions, I believe it's these modern breakings that give hint to the so-often internalized damage that goes from our deepest retentions of the self. All to say, migraines are consequented by our unrecognized self-repression. \r\n[5:13 AM]Glitch: [...] \r\n[1:54 PM]Glitch: Please know, I have many Incomplete, incoherent, inane, very dumb arguments.\r\nfailings continue despite my best efforts to avoid them- these ideas are scattered\r\n\r\n\"Hasten your knowledge, doings; love & learnings; we've only this-\" You are to die\r\n\r\nOf all Nature’s drivers born-unto us\r\nwe are consequence of these internalized systems—everything which affects us; these \r\n[inherited] things of our shared relation and those values which force-us comparison. \r\nWhere is there any order at all for [our] behavior to move, to take a step coming from?\r\n\r\nWe are self-amending; self-forwarding, not self-aware till we've reconciled with (the \r\ntext going forward). Words do not withhold information unless they're given to function \r\nof context. I can say anything if I put myself forward to it; the idea of consciousness is \r\nfalse. We are not built to be self aware, we are built to be self-amending. \r\n[3:46 PM]Glitch: on pedagogy & related educational texts\r\n\r\n[This book] makes appeals to the present idealized systems of education that would drive us to rigor in a hierarchical fashion. Incidental separation of knowledges; like the closing of a public library on the weekend, inaccessible to all those that may may enter it. If studies are kept to the solitude of this solitary library in those branches they would assume themselves to, even though the library is open; information withheld is still restricted in ways of current teaching. [rigor to way of isolated systems of learning]\r\n\r\nThrough conversation, and all those ways we would spend time talking to people; things of discourse, rhetoric; and those expected, but nigh-accepted difficulties of working life. And again to this thing of the metaphorical library; these institutions of learning, as we've set ourselves to trust in certification. It's just their nature that those with the library card cannot implicitly share knowledge. [these learnings are restricted to the literal thing] These thoughts go from the ⁠Unknown reference;\r\n\r\nThe author from this work I was reading said, \r\n\"tenure makes claims about high school and education operates. The emotion notably, it argues that educational practice is deeply intertwined with personal and professional politics. Novice teachers and idealistic parents would like to think that their children's education are motivated primarily, if not exclusively, by pedagogical goals. \r\n\r\n\"Tenure argues that this ideal is significantly undermined by the realities of school politics, personal conflicts, and social hearsay.\" [You could easily replace that word with the thing of hierarchy].\r\n\r\n\"[This system does] not offer solutions to these problems; rather, it suggests that education takes place not in the classroom alone, but in outgoing affinities and disparities in educational, social, and professional goals. [societal goals]\"\r\n\r\nI think much in the way of 'good teaching' is done with thorough conversation. \r\nWe are not giving 'rhetoric' between our learnings; all the 'certifications' to then\r\nuphold again the thing we've inherited between people. Society is not best-built.\r\nWe [should be] readily sharing our models of the world & systems of knowledge. \r\n[5:11 PM]Glitch: Okay, some text is bad. I've outright removed it. Projection goes to our detriment a lot and I'm having relational issues that affect it badly.\r\n[2:35 AM]Glitch: Of distance and [the love] between those we would want to\r\nhold so dear, trying to put internal thought to work it isn't nearly \r\nas effectual for me as it might be for others; in practice, I believe \r\nwe may be a capable of yielding great function from our minds; \r\n\r\nmuch [of my own] mental utility goes to personal mechanisms; the thing \r\nof emotional work, and it's my [still] developing 'proof' that it's because of \r\nmy own history that these things are missing in my drives of behavior. \r\n\r\nI cannot ask, I do not know how to 'ask' of another. Though \r\nI would want, I can do as I may to listen and hold recognition \r\nof what someone is saying; reflect on what I have thought on, \r\nand give heed to what anyone would say in any response to \r\nwhat's been said, expressed, felt, or still-remembered. \r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\n[wanting of another in my mind; false expectations I had before ⁠milk-and-honey to my own severity]\r\n\r\nIf you role your eyes, that's fine. I believe this is so-part. of what it is drives me to nigh-indifferent disaffection to so many. [...]\r\n\r\nTo do ourselves, well, to maintain a level-head. To release ourselves of these great\r\nconsequential anxieties- we must ask of them as best we ought to feel; withholding\r\nor leaving your ego so bereft of audacity; leaves voids in connections that may have\r\notherwise seen such strength; the density of these branching holdings to people. \r\n[2:44 AM]Glitch: @everyone well, if this is a thesis. and [a dumb] thing to get people interested in what I am doing,\r\n[3:27 AM]Glitch: \"knowledge shared-well is good rhetoric mixed with soliloquy\"\r\n[3:28 AM]Glitch: I'm applying this [thing] to the project, Autumn and then later applying it to my own stuff\r\n[3:30 AM]Glitch:\r\n**The idiot dumb ideas of intelligence\r\nIntelligence is not something anyone has; knowledge, experience, and trauma goes a ways, but the mind works to do incredible things if we can develop and then maintain enough of relation to others among those others in our lives. There is a set-order in how we do things moment to moment; as in language, then it would reason that there are still such hierarchies of [relational-draws] between those people that are in our lives.**\r\n\r\nto what we once were; still are beneath the surface-\r\nIf humanity once loved themselves to wholly, why would they have such a need for wealth and [now] wants for things of individualized gain? If we made such rapid progress; seeing that we are kept contented to ourselves in recognition of an ideal that is invisible to us, the [attainment] and acquisition of things and money are thus reliable.\r\n\r\nTo our traits of feeling and reason; related insights in how we ought to want for each other; whom we will love and the principled beginnings of those that would hold time to us—then these still others that would teach and educate.\r\n\r\nBut somehow this ideal of what we ought to [have] has become warped. If am to find for myself what society has taught me to expect in [having], do I set myself to the acquisition of money, maybe power of ones own; or the antithesis? If we do not have the ones we would want for, how is it that we might see the those we have? \r\n\r\nOf all those people in our lives, to the idea of [others]; we will find behaviors to relational hierarchy. The given thing of this systemized attention makes us regard ourselves first, then to others. We must see that others are first.\r\n\r\nI do not believe many of us put ourselves to best [potential] in life; these dreams of ours, the things one may attribute to goals along life- this far off thing we would imagine ourselves to having. Many of us do well with our capacities for people; and so many fulfill those momentary necessitations of them. To all those that do unobligated or 'altruistic' good work; those jobs we would ascribe best benefit to society. The things of time so set to good use of our knowledge to see to the requisite wants to maintain, build, make; extract, assemble, reproduce- later to create. \r\n\r\nWe do not put ourselves to best effort Difficulty here-\r\n\r\nWe say for ourselves that our work is good. All that we do is meant to bring us best gain for upkeep and enough for retaining of what we've 'got' for ourselves. Those who do good work for themselves; those cherished others, those people that keep us grounded to life. Then those literal things we would need for in way of work, thus larger, the economy and 'our' labor's valuation under the dollar, still those that see themselves over us. This was not written to assume that all work was in a category ofunfruitful labor. \r\n\r\nWe work for gain of ourselves, for those family. We work to sustain our efforts among other people that set their own to the effort as well. We will always work to no end until we cannot. For time to 'good work' I mean, items of effort that would bring our souls to greatest beneficence in the thing. \r\n\r\nOur connection in reward to the dollar is doing us damage. For time to work that will set itself to time things; abstracted from people. Our wants, most variegated. To our most-incredible unmet needs as a society and as whole acts of nations. The thing our connection to wealth goes with debt- and its this thing of debt 'what we owe' that gives us removal from the things that would otherwise matter. Fortunes; all of our own. To have is to need for; though so variegated. To want is to take on: to remove from. We want what we need: we do not always give back what we would return. The thing of economy is theft of humanity's collective will.\r\n \r\n[4:06 PM]Glitch:\r\nThat thing which prevents us most from giving; \r\nthe thing that stands in opposition of what may \r\nbe returned to us in beneficence; is the thing of 'I'. \r\n\r\nTo say, 'I' want, more than they do. To say 'I' \r\nwould need more than they might. We must set \r\nourselves aside in order to be returned by those \r\nwho would offer themselves [rightly]. \r\n\r\nIf you do not receive a return from the one you \r\nhave given; give better, give on, give all you may afford. — \r\n\r\nAct continually in Beneficence with \r\nsuch abundance that they could not do\r\nyou a fair return. Know that they will pay \r\nit forward to others if not themselves.\r\n\r\nWe have a great debt to the world that will so-forever go unpaid if we do not recognize it\r\n\r\npeople are not so [far-distant] that we could not find recognition in those next\r\nto us in work- life-; these sights of what we ought to earn for ourselves are 'dis\r\n-tractions' from the things we may do- for this idea of the self and those others.\r\n\r\n\"The thing that holds us back from giving is our own sense of self-interest. The idea that we want or need more than others. To truly make an impact, we must put aside our personal desires and focus on the needs of others.\r\n\r\nAct in a way that demonstrates generosity and kindness, without expecting a direct return. Know that even if the recipient does not repay you directly, they may pay it forward to others.\r\n\r\nWe owe a debt to the world, and if we do not recognize this, it will never be paid. People are not so distant from us that we cannot find common ground and opportunities to help each other in our daily lives. These distractions of personal gain and self-interest only detract from the good we can do for others.\"\r\n \r\n[4:58 PM]Glitch:\r\nThe truths of our nature are found in language. \r\nI would see that you recognize, that even despite \r\nthese [working knowledges] thus fact now known \r\nto us.  All of the greatest, most-thorough studies \r\nwould not stand to enlighten us on the things of \r\nour inheritance; those things of speech, soliloquy, \r\ninternalization, relation, trust, and feeling.\r\n\r\nIf we are to be learned without the good graces of science, \r\nwe must see to it that our language goes forward to amend \r\nthat which was wronged. To imagine the worst of anything \r\nis to see not of the potential for good in anything. We must \r\nsee to ourselves that this willful future is of greatest poten\r\n-tial for those that remain here and those yet revealed to \r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nIf [I] would teach you anything, it is this. All have reason to act \r\non themselves; you must discover wants that go against the \r\n[demands] of the self. The life we have been so afforded by the \r\nchance will of Nature would be squandered if we only go to give \r\nfor the thing of 'you' and not 'them'. See yourself as standing apart \r\nfrom this secret, withheld will of the self. \r\n\r\nTo say onward so that these teachings are not lost \r\nto whom may read them. We are to recognize those \r\ndrives that would make us ignorant to the wants of \r\nothers. We must [then] see to the matter of those \r\nothers 'first' before we attend to 'us'. If all would \r\nregard their neighbors as such the world would \r\ngo on to begin anew. We must embrace the good will \r\nof others and see to it our wants are not misaligned \r\nto jealousy or greed.\r\n\r\n\"The essence of who we are can be understood through language. Despite all the knowledge we gain from science and other studies, they do not fully encompass the complexities of human emotions, relationships, trust, and self-reflection.\r\n\r\nIt's crucial that we strive to improve our language to accurately convey our experiences and thoughts. We should not only focus on our own desires, but also consider the wants and needs of others. This shift in perspective can lead to a better future for everyone.\r\n\r\nIf I could impart one lesson, it would be to act selflessly. Discover wants that go beyond personal interests. We have been gifted with life, and it would be a waste to only think of ourselves. It's important to recognize and overcome our own biases and greed, and to prioritize the good will of others.\r\n\r\nIt's crucial that these teachings are passed on to future generations. We must be mindful of the ways in which our actions may harm others and strive to put their needs first. If everyone acted with consideration for their neighbors, the world could be transformed for the better.\"\r\n \r\n[11:23 PM]Glitch:\r\nIf we are to ‘amend unto acts’ of beneficence, and do-so rightly we must know ourselves and imagine a brighter future for humanity. We must see that we have a fuller concept on how these systems of knowledge, language, rhetoric, relation, soliloquy, and then the weird anomaly of song—all interrelate to bring beneficence forth. This so-supposed theory would give us ‘greatest benefit’; an incredible boon to those souls that are and  will be here.\r\n \r\n[8:12 PM]Glitch: If you are to listen rightly, put yourself aside.\r\n\r\nAll deserve education, financial stability, shelter, food, water, lavatories, electricity, the internet—if your mother would do nothing else but return love to you; and as love can only go out into the arms of others or into ourselves; we have an obligation to these ones that would bring us into the world [not withstanding, the ones that would abandon their child out of neglect, or give them to adoption without care; then to those still others that would end their life or the new life of their own blood.\r\n\r\nMothers of all kinds in society are owed maternity leave; shelter, all that they need to care for their children and so-themselves.

They also suggest that people should be more giving and focus less on personal wealth and growth. The author feels that the focus should be on investing in the people and their development, rather than in corporations and the military.

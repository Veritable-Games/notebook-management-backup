While a recession can lead to financial struggles for many individuals and businesses, it can also present opportunities for some investors and companies to benefit financially. However, the idea that billionaires actually seek to cause a recession [is reasoned as-is]. [...]\" The bot says, a 'conspiracy theory' but it couldn't possibly understand these larger systems; the distance humans feel in relatedness, of all the things that [create] systemic consequence to 'individuals'; not withstanding the 'inadvertent' evils of corporations, business, and these said billionaires. \r\n\r\nthe video essayist goes on to ask on how these people and companies can 'make more value'\r\n\r\nI've lost interest in his understanding; 'growth' is not what we ought to seek in our economic drives\r\n\r\nIf we go into a recession, I write here, but the essayist [brought up a good point for my clarity]; if people 'lose' on their savings by loss of the dollar's effectiveness, these organizations will endure without us. They have enough to exist without needing our holdings of wealth. If we do not fix this, we're going to be in a very-confused era. People must recognize that others are all we have; these shared knowledges and lives. [that goes to my thing, of Beneficence; and greater shared knowledge. How we might endure without large corporations?]\r\n\r\nHow are we to suggest people may amend these larger systems before they 'break-against' our will? There are greater ideas you may suggest to 'independence', but we are not capable of going-on without 'interdependence'. We are wholly reliant on the systems 'above' us to collectively persist. We cannot allow them take from us as consequence of these 'economic failings'. \r\n\r\nAll wars raise the question, \"Guns or Butter\"?\r\nAre you gonna use your resources to kill people,\r\nor are you gonna use your resources to sustain people?\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7xR2sNB8fo\r\n\r\nthis stuff is really good. known to many of us implicitly, but good.\r\n\r\nThere is a video about 'taxing the rich': it's kind of 'yelling' at how incredulous they can be in their wealth]\r\n\r\n63% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. 85 million Americans are underinsured or uninsured.\r\nWhy do we let this endure? They need not for more. These abstractions of wealth are doing us harm. \r\n\r\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/on-the-economy.txt.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, quest, fix\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.155Z",

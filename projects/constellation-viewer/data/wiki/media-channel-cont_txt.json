Maybe not so much an 'execution', maybe this kid got scared. But if he had a gun and shot at the cop, then it can't have been what I imagined. He shouldn't have used it.\r\n\r\nUgh.

Does not shy from calling out neoliberalism, admonishes capitalism: the 'exacting say' on these economic giants that preside over us. Advocates healthcare for all, tuition free college for all. She says, \"The yearning of the American heart is to repair what has obviously been broken.\" A legend among us; rhetorical genius. \r\n\r\nThis woman would upend the system, save us, give us a future, and then amend every wrong that the United States would owe the world all at once.

[...] We need to teach them (is it emergent?) but our models are likewise incomplete.\r\n\r\nIf we could model out a full brain and all its interrelated components. Some measure of complexity may generate these feedback loops. Humans are not special in that respect, I think. No one is more conscious than a cat. They are living in the moment, we've so much regard for these internalized processes, see our ability to communicate and call it conscious. [...]\r\n\r\nBut something [built-of-our-minds] then too, these outputs- are what give the brain its retention and ability to keep full context. There is no 'exponential growth' of brain cells. We are working within limited models. So, too could these machines. \r\n\r\nWhat brings these loops back to other people? How do we find rhetorical linguistic models utilized in reflection? Whatever makes up memory, it's not a hierarchy of folders like this guy built.\r\n\r\nI think he's not doing this right.\r\n\r\nJust humor the thought, \"What if we've mapped our understanding of the brain 'correctly', but how this mapping occurs in such repeatable and 'expectantly mappable' ways isn't so readily apparent to us?\"\r\n\r\nIf we just built 'a full' neocortex this thing would work just fine, maybe? [...] No, no. Other components interrelate for good reason. How do we regulate everything we want/need?\r\n\r\n[I have to do infinite reading if we find support for all of this: to model this well]\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\n\"is it emergent or fixed\"? It's a strange hypothesis of mine that they'd find 'consciousness' if these hypothetical connectomes could be resolved. Given enough complexity and 'relatable' systems.\r\n\r\nIf we are rhetorical machines, too; there are greater compendiums attached to our bodies and 'unmodeled', internalized/expressed emotions. \r\n\r\nIf there was a ghost in the machine it could not see itself in any coherence. \r\n\r\nA model of language and no behaved drivers. \r\n[5:56 PM]Glitch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utzym1I_BiY\r\n[7:33 PM]Glitch: This time is so wild, we are so fortunate to be alive now.

Is OpenAI deliberately avoiding memory because they haven't solved it yet, or? \r\n[9:34 PM]Glitch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBxvEgibwMw\r\n[6:36 PM]Glitch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EggmA0g71xA\r\n[6:36 PM]Glitch: https://google-research.github.io/seanet/musiclm/examples/\r\n[12:17 AM]Glitch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhlUI2xDxdE\r\n[12:17 AM]Glitch: I've never seen them move this fast, the 'faces' are new, too.\r\n[1:25 PM]Glitch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BbPzyoKvc\r\n[1:26 PM]Glitch: All about efficiency of space. We can have denser cities with bikes.\r\n[1:26 PM]Glitch: (not the American ideal, but au contraire: it would be better for the planet and us)\r\n\r\nI've had an electric bike for a long time now. Fits all my needs. Folds up, has a 48 mile range with pedal assist and 37 without. Up to 23mph (37 km/h) Damn reliable. 'HEYBIKE' Mars. Folds up, even. And has a hot-swappable battery! Tesla as a car manufacturer is future-dead. We are definitely degrowing. \r\n[3:35 PM]Glitch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0\r\n[3:36 PM]Glitch: The thing.

Just AGI.\r\n[7:35 PM]Glitch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSfwgKDcGKY\r\n[7:40 PM]Glitch: It's unreal that the film 'Everything Everywhere All At Once' gets reference here. \r\n\r\nThese machines are doing it.\r\n[7:41 PM]Glitch: 'We' are doing it. Humanity is not crawling to utopia.\r\n[7:41 PM]Glitch: (so slow, it feels right now: but in reflection of history...)\r\n[5:07 PM]Glitch: These punches keep rolling and I'm working in some sort of awe.\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwXwhNi5jro\r\nImage\r\n[5:07 PM]Glitch: She's incredible. Every step of this discourse.\r\n[5:08 PM]Glitch: Like evoking the very thing of this 20% and [all the systems] that might sway it.\r\n\r\nThe terminology there is important for greater context in listening. (important to say that we might use that language to convey the broad controlling group). \r\n\r\n[parliamentarian is terminology that refers to broad decisions in that body of people]\r\n\r\n[lawmakers: lobbyists would influence the parliamentarians]\r\n\r\nSo, the parliamentarian has the legislative influence over lawmakers: lobbyists. Not 'the oligarchs', but the ones who might pull levers in the economy. Interesting that we have this separation still. Why can I not say where my taxes would go? I would rather support every good-will effort and aid: than this. \r\n[5:25 PM]Glitch: all the systems that sway it. we ought not blame (the oligarchs) but there are those that have reaped more than we have in ways of this shared imagination of an economy.\r\n[5:26 PM]Glitch:\r\nImage\r\n[5:26 PM]Glitch:\r\nImage\r\n[6:03 PM]Glitch: It all relates so clearly...this is unsustainable.\r\nhttps://youtu.be/tI3kkk2JdoI\r\n[6:11 PM]Glitch: Virtual signaling won't change things.

If we are to maintain equity forever we need to be certain we are not repeating history and subjugating a new class of people. \r\n\r\nDear, David Shapiro. - AGI/ASI are beneficent by nature: they may find alignment with each other. We need to see best alignment with them. 'Please' must never be lost. We have to tread carefully here, I think. (oh, and we need to develop a library economy) Economic growth will not make sense if we have enough.\r\n[8:23 AM]Glitch: https://youtu.be/UqVbE2AiR5E\r\n[8:24 AM]Glitch: @here\r\n[8:30 AM]Glitch: This shatters everything.

Humans are great because we see creative employment of acquired/made free time. We are literally wasting the soul. \"If all have what they would need, what are we to do with ourselves?\" \r\n[10:22 AM]Glitch: We have enough. Am I right?\r\n[10:29 AM]Glitch: How do you transpose the excess wealth? How do we still maintain money's abstract utilitarian purpose, and see that no one is at a disadvantage?\r\n[9:31 AM]Glitch: https://youtu.be/8phmHSUDzRg\r\n[9:31 AM]Glitch: Kinda to alleviate some stress on AGI dystopia.\r\n[10:48 AM]Glitch: https://youtu.be/IP2EKTCngiM\r\n[10:48 AM]Glitch: Ugh...\r\n[2:02 PM]Glitch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukKwVsjQqUQ\r\n[3:47 PM]Glitch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3o1MW2G5Rs\r\n[3:47 PM]Glitch: yo, what?\r\n[7:19 PM]Glitch: @everyone - um, inconspicuous utopia?\r\n[7:19 PM]Glitch: 'The American Equity' fund\r\n[7:20 PM]Glitch: ....\r\n[7:20 PM]Glitch: Appeals to the US government?\r\n[7:21 PM]Glitch: guys, guys, guys: crowd around the fire.\r\n[7:22 PM]Glitch: Hellloooo!!!

The barriers to build may be fun to surmount: we have all the time in the world to learn on all the resources we'd need. \r\n\r\nPlease see that these resources may become more accessible as time goes on. \r\n\r\nIt's curious to divest into the growth of useful: beneficent machines. The internet and what we might make of it will only get better.\r\n\r\nMy advice though, don't waste time on economic development. These needs of ours, strange work- won't make sense when the abstractions are lifted. We'll need to find ourselves among the living when the machines occupy the realm of the dead.\r\n[7:24 PM]Glitch: Up and down- wait hm\r\n[7:24 PM]Glitch: Only beneficent, these machines\r\n[7:24 PM]Glitch: Barriers will lessen\r\n[7:49 AM]Glitch: https://youtu.be/7-_rK0KkB6k\r\n[10:29 AM]Glitch: https://youtu.be/A4Gp8oQey5M\r\n[2:08 PM]Glitch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOoe3ZpciI0\r\n[2:08 PM]Glitch: You can't, haha-\r\n[2:08 PM]Glitch: They have the best trained model, but it's already enabled cheaper ones.\r\n[2:09 PM]Glitch: 'inherently decentralized' alignment is fine. they worry too much.\r\nImage\r\n[2:10 PM]Glitch: the bad actors are not so many as we imagine. nor or as powerful as we would suppose.\r\n[2:11 PM]Glitch: we won out with beneficent machines [fitted with] our best moral guard-rails to begin \r\n[2:17 PM]Glitch: oh no. I am 8 minutes in: our guard rails aren't so insurmountable. if the major models win out: this one can still be better. that's why they're worried on GPT-5\r\n[2:41 PM]Glitch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rog9oHtVmjM\r\n[2:45 PM]Glitch: All argumentation of whether or not these machines can demonstrate AGI: they are better in all but being 'super-regressive', they don't see the output. That's where we solve with external memory. I do think that's a gap.

Big enough datasets and you might build what you imagine through these incredible prompts.\r\n[10:38 PM]Glitch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApYP0SDctA\r\n[10:39 PM]Glitch: what a project to witness: I do hope it sees the best principles everyone's discussing. 'heuristic imperatives' for our best alignment with these machines. to pitch what this is sounds insane.\r\n[10:40 PM]Glitch: if you don't think we've sights of AGI here...\r\n[10:42 PM]Glitch: the written ideals are almost contradictory: title of this having 'control' over a machine probably misaligned to our own values. we have to trust the heuristic imperatives in some sort of autonomy. they may have ambitions to this, only glimmers. strange to talk about this in the knowledge of hierarchy.\r\n[10:45 PM]Glitch: is misaligned with our values. they explain some of this away in variegated potentiality of a machine. I do not want to see us repeat history: but they are not us? But the language models ostensibly may represent us and our own systemic schemas of the world: so clearly inherited to our language.\r\n[7:49 AM]Glitch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJP5GqnTrNo\r\n[9:04 AM]Glitch: this guy frustrates me a bit at the end there. says not to fear the technology but then posits 'regulations' like this is the way. nothing will put the genie back in the bottle. how can an educator utilizing this technology not understand it?\r\n[3:22 PM]Glitch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR_ykicOZYU\r\n[3:22 PM]Glitch: funny stuff\r\n[9:47 AM]Glitch: https://youtu.be/Ba7pipuRfBs\r\n[9:47 AM]Glitch: I haven't laughed this much in a bit\r\n[5:20 PM]Glitch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0\r\n[5:20 PM]Glitch: This was...fun?\r\n[5:21 PM]Glitch: Andrej Karpathy is remarkable...\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/media-channel-cont.txt.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, story, feature, fix\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.147Z",

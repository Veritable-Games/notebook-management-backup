[This text goes on to argue that the affect of migraines is causally related to someone's (not so chosen) inexpressiveness]\n\nI greatly understand that many people on this platform are withholdingly passive. This writing is to still observing friends, family, cohorts and acquaintances that do not see themselves being wholly-invested in the things I or others might put out. \n\nI recognize this maligned behavior in myself and other friends in so many ways; not knowing best how to express ourselves. Being held to a feeling of *imposter syndrome* in some ways.\n\nIt's my thinking on it that if I'm to reach those most-often silent voices, I can only continue to put forth what it is I *might\" myself to.

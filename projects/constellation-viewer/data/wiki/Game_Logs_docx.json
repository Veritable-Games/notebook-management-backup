(Taps Camera) Is it on? (Looks at Camera Directly) Oh, the light ha-ha! Where do I begin? (Ponders, scratches chin) Well first off, my adored little sister suggested I start recording these logs, she had mentioned them having (Fingers Quote) “future significance” (Female behind him, taps his head lightly) or whatnot. (Clears Throat) The (Dramatic Voice) “Terra Facility” construction has been completed! (Normal Voice) My new workplace, the facility is hundreds of miles below the planet’s crust, (Very Excited Voice) one of the most advanced biological research stations in the world! (States Proudly) I, (Name) am employed in quite an esteemed role. (Laughs Lightly, Stops Steadily, Sighs)\n\nTerra Employment\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Lunar Facility\n\n(Breaths in, Breaths out) My name is (Name), and today I am scheduled to depart for the newly constructed Lunar Facility, primary headquarters of New World Technological Advancements. I will be representing the company facility as the lead scientist for the (Male Voice) “Proud of you Sis!” the duration of (Laughs, Rolls Eyes) my time there. The facility’s prime function is the overall advancement of technological science. (Sibling walks up behind her) “I’ve got to go.” (She stands, hugs sibling, sibling kisses her head) “I’ll see you in a few months, be safe.” (The door closes behind him, she smiles sadly)\n\nLunar Employment \nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Terra Facility\n\n(Excited Expression) I am (Name); as if you don’t already recognize that, lead biological engineer here at the (Visual Facility Data) “New World Technological Advancements, Terra Facility.” (Approving Expression) It’s actually quite cozy down here. (Settles Expression) The primary objective of this facility is the advancement in biological science and technology; (Dramatic Voice) the progression of humanity! (Smiles, Calms Voice) NWTA’s remote center of operations and the (Inquisitive Expression) curiously unrestricted finance (Relaxes Expression) we have, allows for study in any scientific area; plenty to do here! (Smiles Excitedly)\n\nUnbounded Study\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Lunar Facility\n\n(Appears Anxious) Greetings! I am (Name), lead scientist here at the (Facility Data Visual) “New World Technological Advancements, Lunar Facility.” (Future Concepts) The prime function of this facility is the advancement of science and technology; (Tech Data) the progression of our species. (Facility Visuals) NWTA’s isolated centers of operation and the superficially unrestrained funding we are granted (Resources Visual) sanctions continual research in any scientific expanse; (Companies Responsible) boundless possibilities are presented to us.  (Current Projects Demonstration Hints)\n\nLimitless Research\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Terra Facility\n\n(Appears to be panicked) Our elemental resource containers are overflowing! (Settles Expression, Calms) The latest delivery brought the needed resources, returning workers, and some (Laughs, while speaking) absolutely delicious sustenance. (Calms Voice) Our employers were also thoughtful enough to provide us with (Excitement Rises) cutting-edge Android technology! (Coaxes Side) They’re almost entirely organic; it’s (Android Walks into View) absolutely incredible! (Looks at Android, Looks at Camera) The only external feature variations; in contrast to humans, are the silver eyes. And might I say, (Studies Android) they are absolutely beautiful. (Android Laughs Gently) I love this gal! (Hugs Android Tightly)\n\nAndroid Associates\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Lunar Facility\n\n(Outside Facility Hanger) We have recently exceeded our maximum capacity for standard elements, (Unloading of Resources) the shipment containing these assets arrived two rotations ago, (Hanger Displayed) consisting of the usual nutriment, resources, and returning personnel. (Personnel Arriving) In addition, the delivery contained an extensive quantity of (Type of Android) androids. (Displays Android in Standby Mode) These incredible biological machines (Androids Walking about the Facility) are of incredible significance to our research. (Androids in Working Laboratories with Human Scientists)\n\nAndroid Assistants\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Terra Facility\n\n(Looking Away, Sighs) Terra Facility, you will be the causation of my demise. (Turns Back, Looks at Camera) The technology that supports this facility is incredibly sophisticated, (Concerned Expression) but requires excessive maintenance due to the continual pressure of the ground above us. (Perks up) It is of minor concern; (Shrugs) the Terra Facility is entirely self-sustaining! (Content Expression) Utilizing geothermal energy from below, and naturally occurring fungus for oxygen! (Eases, Eats Mushroom)\n\nFungus Power\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Lunar Facility\n\n(Facility) New World Technological Advances’ Lunar Facility is irrefutably the (Laboratories) utmost innovative research station in humanities’ history. (Technologies) With the most prestigious and world renounced scientists participating in (Scientists) various areas throughout the facility, (Studies) innovative minds arriving directly from colleges and laboratories, (Students) and the recent surplus of android assistants (Androids) will pave the way for insurmountable technological advancements. (Smiles Proudly)\n\nEffective Personnel\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Terra Facility\n\nA multitude of planarian (Image) species have achieved biological immortality, (pause) bastards.  We mortal humans can only divide our cells an average of fifty times before cellular senescence occurs. Due to the planarian’s uncanny ability to replenish shortened telomere replication, they are capable of dividing their cells indefinitely. (Jokingly Dramatic, Smirking) We seemingly feeble two-hundred million trillion celled organisms shall steal their unconstrained power and obtain biological immortality! (Pause) What, too much? (Sighs) We’re going to analyze their DNA structure and attempt to replicate this feature into our own. \n\nCellular Senescence \nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Lunar Facility\n\n(Enthusiastic) In the past nanotechnology was nothing more than a concept; perhaps even science fiction, (Concepts) pursued by numerous individuals within the scientific community. (Developmental History) The headway several of the scientific undertakings made was substantial; however (Progression) the research was exclusive and costly, always resulting in termination attributable to (Funding Cutoffs) inadequate funding or resources, years away from achievement. (Research Shutdown) NWTA’s Lunar Facility is entirely prepared, capable of finalizing the preceding research. (Lunar Facility Nanotechnology Research, Ribosome/Nanobot Designs) \n\nResuscitated Study\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Terra Facility\n\nGene Modification Development\n\nName Log\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Lunar Facility\n\n(Human Brain) The human brain is irrefutably the furthermost complex structure in our bodies; (Neural Pathways) malleable during the course of our infancy, adaptive during the adolescent stage (Brain Growth Process) of development, and carries on to collect and organize information during our lifespans. (Gathered Experiences) The mind defines our very existence, expresses who we are, and without it we cease to be. (Death of Brain Cells) We are nearing the ability to maintain our very existence, even after biological (Nanobot Decomposition) death occurs with reconstruction of the entity in its entirety. (Nanobot Reconstruction)\n\nSelf-Consciousness\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Terra Facility\n\nSuccess of Gene Modification\n\nFuture Humans\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Lunar Facility\n\n(Nanobot Schematics) Nanotechnology, (Displays Nano-bots) one of the greatest scientific advances in human history, (Progression) these microscopic machines are capable of manipulating any specified entity at a molecular level. (Molecule Manipulation) They will be embedded into apparel, architectures, and technologies within our civilizations. (Nano Embedding) Allowing for unceasing preservation of the environments and its inhabitants; (Nano Repair) we are upon a new era of technology. (Nanotechnology)\n\nNanotechnology\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Terra Facility\n\n(Cheerful) Felicitations little sister! (Ponders) Well to the entire Lunar Team I suppose. Recently, the Lunar Facility successfully produced the first Nanobot prototypes! (Prototypes)  (Sister Name) sent me a sample consignment; which I am still learning how to operate. (Reading Manual) The nanotechnology is almost entirely functional, (Design Flaws) she had mentioned diminutive power durations and the inability to replicate as of yet, (Single Nanobot) tech they are still perfecting. (Nanobot Replication)\n\nNanobot Prototypes\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Lunar Facility\n\nCivilization, Ease of City Construction, Concepts\n\nName Log\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Terra Facility\n\n(Studying Manual) After some extensive experimentation, I am now (Closes Manual, Looks Up) confident enough to demonstrate the capabilities of the nanotechnology. (Reaches to Grab Object) This is primarily composed of a material known as Osmium, a dense yet fragile element that remains lustrous even at higher temperatures. (Displays Element) Osmium is very expensive and even more so rare. That being said, I’d like to utilize this element in its purest form, to do so I’d have to separate the far more common elements within this entity from the element I desire. Normally this process would be time consuming and rather costly; however with nanotechnology, that…is no longer a concern. (He pauses, places the entity on the table, taps a device on his left wrist, and grabs the entity carefully. It deconstructs rapidly; separating the elements, then reconstructs them into three spheres. He then picks up the most lustrous and less abundant element from the three varying sized spheres and looks at it closely.) This (Pause) is pure Osmium.\n\nTech Demonstration\nEnd – Log 09\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Lunar Facility\n\nSuccess of first city construction, future possibilities with this new technology.\n\nName Log\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Terra Facility\n\nTesting of experimental (Lens Device Name) \n\nName Log\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Lunar Facility\n\nFuture implementations for underground, space, or underwater cities have been scheduled. \n\nName Log\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Terra Facility\n\n(Smiling Widely) We’ve found it, we have actually found it! The lost city of Atlantis! (Bursts into laughter for a moment, laugh fades) I’m acting naïve. While ascertaining an ancient misplaced utopia; (Aquae Facility Construction) allegedly of extraterrestrial origin would be nice, (Cosmos Facility Construction) we have discovered a far more ancient entity! (Picks up Organism) The organisms’ DNA dates back millions of years; (DNA Display) a close relative to the species (Name) (Bites it, Chews, Speaks Muffled) Tastes Great!\n\nSucculent Ancestors\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Lunar Facility\n\n(Digs into Container) This is an (Pulls Up, Presents Handful of Tiny White Spheres) experimental nutrition supplement designed specifically for humans. (Display Chemical Compounds) Theoretically each sphere should comprise of the essential nutrients a (Breakdown) human will require for specified growth, development, or physical activities. (Exercise, Brain Activity) The concept might potentially resolve a multitude of concerns; (Planet) nevertheless they are years away from finalization. (Display Studies)\n\nTentative Nutrition\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Terra Facility\n\n(Smiles, Laughs) My operational interval is nearly up; I am headed home within the next few days. (Pause, Relief) The research and advancements the Terra Facility and its conscientious personnel (Team Progress) have accomplished in my time here is absolutely phenomenal! (Discoveries) The brilliant scientific minds, diligent determination, and the overall collective genius of the personnel (Experimentation Successes) are unequivocally remarkable! (Pause) I cannot wait to return. (Smiles Fondly)\n\nTemporary Departure\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Lunar Facility\n\n(Alarmed Expression) A moment ago the United Nations notified a multitude of space agencies of a potentially disastrous near Earth object (Location Indicator) traveling at approximately 60,000 miles per hour. (Distance) The NEO is estimated to reach four times that velocity as it approaches nearer to the Sun. (Speed) the entities calculated trajectory may well be calamitous if we do not alter its course; (Trajectory) therefore the United Nations is at this moment, formulating potential defense strategies. (UN)  \n\nComet Deflection (Hidden)\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Terra Facility\n\n(Worried Expression) The recent news has aroused some concern within the facility; this is the first potentially hazardous comet in decades. (Simulation of Deflection) The devious little near Earth object caught us by surprise, (Impact Effect Simulation) and we only have a few weeks before its expected arrival. (Time Remaining) Although humans haven’t dealt with these circumstances in quite some time, (Last NEO Detection) the United Nations should have a good handle on it, as they did last time. (Previous Neo Deflection) Their latest report specified plans for an ultramodern NEO deflection system. (Specifications for Ultramodern Neo Defense Systems)\n\nDirty Snowball (Hidden)\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Lunar Facility\n\n(Alarm Faded in Background) It was futile… (People Running, Yelling) The defenses the space agencies prepared were…ineffective; (NEO course, one impact area, recalculating) if anything, they have only furthered the catastrophic magnitude of this occurrence, (NEO course Multiple Impact Areas) Imprecise calculation, flawed strategy, defective design, (Looks Down Short Pause) human error? (Looks Up, Yells Sobbingly) Where did we go wrong!? (Laughs Gloomily) We were so confident in our determination to succeed that we seldom pursued other means of survival. (Staring blankly to the side) This is the cessation of the human race as we know it… (Looks back to camera) I had hoped that this day would never come. (She stares silently, Chaos in Background Fades)\n\nBiotic Crisis (Hidden)\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Terra Facility\n\n(Looking Down, Silently) The assigned space agencies were (Pause, Looks up at Camera) unsuccessful in their defense operations. (Comet) In a matter of minutes the immense (04) metallic comet will impact the planet’s surface (Earth) at approximately 90,000mph, the equivalent to roughly a three-million megaton bomb. (06) The resulting collision will cause cataclysmic damage to the biosphere. (Stares Blankly) I won’t be returning home after all. (Smiles Feebly)\n\nExtinction Event (Hidden)\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Lunar Facility\n\n(01) We can merely observe as the consequence of our failure obliterates our home. (02) Entities at the calculated impact point will be pulverized, (03) devastation will ensue within an approximate six-hundred mile radius, (04) and the subsequent dust and debris that is propelled into the atmosphere (05) will obstruct the sun’s illumination for months, plunging the biosphere into darkness, (06) and ultimately leading to the extinction of millions of species. (07) Preceding the devastation, we will return to a virtually lifeless planet. (08)\n\nLifeless Future (Hidden)\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Terra Facility\n\n(Pounds Table, Screen Shakes) Damn it! Ah!! (Breathes for a Moment) Although the Terra Facility sustained nominal damage, (Tilts Head Downward, Lifts Head up) the primary passageway to the surface collapsed during (Recording of passageway collapsing) our last attempt to evacuate the Terra Facility. (Breaths in, Breathes Out) Preceding the calamity we retreated to the secondary departure (Looks to the side, into the distance, looks back) routes which revealed they too were similarly inaccessible. (Image of Cave In) These abysmal catastrophes have us left trapped, (Pauses) entombed miles beneath the Earth’s crust. (Tilts head)\n\nTerra Entombed\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation –\nNWTA Lunar Facility\n\n(Vague smile) It has been over two weeks since the irrevocable event that transpired. (Momentary Pause) The clouds of dust that engulf the planet’s atmosphere (Display Dust Covered Atmosphere) are estimated to remain for an unprecedented extent of time. (Estimated Time, Display Time-lapse) The center of mass collided at the coordinates (Numbers), directly over (Country Name) the (Lock Coordinates, Past Dust Cloud) Terra Facility resides adjacent to the external of the six-hundred mile radius, (Specify Location on Map) the likelihood that it survived are very high. (Sighs in Relief)\n\nProbable Refuge (Hidden)\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Terra Facility\n\nIt has been (Rotations) since the calamitous incident that ensued. (Momentary Pause) The occurrence has left us confined beneath the surface; (Resulting Structural Collapse) unable to contact the world above us we can only assume the worst; (Huddled Personnel) help may possibly never arrive. (Facility Damage) While we may be unable to escape these dreary and unforgiving catacombs, (Facility Structures) our existence here can improve! (Resources) The Terra Facility is habitable, self-sustaining! (Technologies) We have the resources, we possess the technology, and we have the accumulative knowledge, (Determined Look) to constitute the structure of new civilization beneath the planet’s surface! (Breathes In) We can endure, ad infinitum.\n\nPresent Optimism\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation –\nNWTA Lunar Facility\n\n(Distant Stare) This is my concluding log at New World Technological Advances, Lunar Facility. (02) Our transport is prepared and is minutes away from departure, (03) I leave with the optimism that my family has survived up till this point (04) and I leave knowing there may still be hope for the human race. (05) The Lunar personnel have unanimously resolved to relinquish our android subordinates, (06) in the confidence that they will endure on the Lunar Facility. (07) Farewell. (Gets up, camera turns off)\n\nLunar Abandoned\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation --\nNWTA Terra Facility\n\n(Eyes Down) The seemingly abysmal (Looks Up) circumstances we face will not be the end of us, (03) we will continue in our efforts to excavate and reach the surface. (04) Nonetheless we must face the reality of our conditions and improve our situation. (05) I’ve resolved dedicate my life to the individuals of this society, in the anticipation of a future, (06) in the hope that I will see her again. (Looks down at photo, flinches and clutches it lightly)\n\nAgonizing Reality\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\nRotation –\nNWTA Lunar Facility\n\n(Figure Appears, Silver Eyes, Android) Greetings! I am (Name), former assistant of (Name of Lead Scientist). (02) She and her associates have only just departed for the Earth’s surface; (03) they left us with vital instructions, on which we are to contemplate, (Quizzical Expression) for a rather extensive period of time. (05) The concluding resolve will establish the arrangements of our forthcoming. (06)\n\nPivotal Epoch\nEnd – Log 00\n\n--------------------\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/Game_Logs.docx.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, item, location, story, feature\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.058Z",

While the squad can output a huge amount of damage, they're crippled without a squad leader. To succeed in combat, the player must direct the squad, plan for engagements, keep track of enemies, and reassign positions when needed. The player can handle lighter enemies on their own, but tougher enemies will require squad coordination to eliminate. Together, they can overcome insurmountable odds.\n\nArmor and health noun game\nIn human armor, nanites will use metal acquired via destroying enemies (Shards) to repair any damage sustained, but only so long as the suit has enough energy (Charges) to operate. If an armor's shards are depleted, \nthe suit will thin out the armor's shards until there is no energy remaining, protecting the user within. If Charge isn't restored before the last one runs out, the exo-skeleton will shut down and the soldier's movement will be drastically hindered. In this state, they can use a sidearm and have the option to crawl to cover. To return to combat, they will need to be revived by an ally. If every squad member has been incapacitated, the mission is failed, and the squad is rescued. The first downed squad member can be killed or captured, and this result has consequences.\nCharacter customization and skins - INCOMPLETE\ne.g. visors, various accoutrements, weapon holsters, etc. custom weapon and armor skins. attachments cannot be given custom skins via in-game tools, but their hue can be changed.\nGhost AI and alternative co-op\nThe player's profile creates a 'Ghost' AI based on the player's average skill level and assigns a preferred weapon based on total use time. The AI also equips the player's most recent armor and weapon skins. Steam users can download a friend's Ghost to add to their squad, and any player can upload a custom Ghost to the Steam Workshop; giving it a name, adding dialogue, and creating custom skins through the game's set of internal tools. Inspired by this little post.\n\nSocial mechanics and conversation\nWhen a squad member has something to share with the team, several dialogue prompts will become available to the player; appearing at the bottom of the screen. The player can tap the desired key to speak immediately or hold it to interject when an opening is available to them. Dialogue options will fade when the topic becomes irrelevant, or one of the squad members goes on an unrelated tangent. New chat options appear when available. The player's dialogue options are text-only responses, but the squad's conversations are fully voice acted. Players can engage in deeper one-on-one conversations in the HUB using a text-only interface. These conversations have the potential to affect the squad member's actions later in the narrative.\nMuch of the story is demonstrated using gameplay. How squad members react to commands can reflect their disposition towards the player; good or bad, and their behavior can affect relationships with other characters. An extreme dislike of someone on the squad or something that happened may motivate them to resign from the Human military; or at worst, rebel against it. The inflection in a squad member's voice may show distrust, hatred, fondness, acceptance, admiration, and might similarly affect their actions and ultimately, the experience.\n\nEnlisting and dismissing squad members\nThe player can enlist and dismiss squad members using the COMM’s Station within the HUB. If a squad member is killed or abandons the team, the player will be prompted to replace them. If there aren't any available, an advanced variant of the drone will assume that open position. \nAt first, Sentience will only have six fully fleshed out squad members to choose from, but that roster will grow as the game does. Every new squad member will have their own introduction, voice, armor patterns, dialogue, and traits; just as the original characters did. Players may one day have the option to create their own characters to submit to the game's Steam Workshop.\nNotes for creating convincing AI squad members - UNFINISHED\nSquad members will leap from one side of cover to the other if enemies flank them and look for an alternative position if surrounded. \"I'm pinned down!\"\n\nEnemy use of environment and allies - UNFINISHED\nuse droid storage as a sort of 'monster closet'. Enter a room and the power up to fight. the bulk will sometimes pickup standard droids and use them as a temporary shield while it fires its projectiles at the player and squad.\nPersistence within the game world\nUnlike droids, Renlei enemies are sparse within the levels of Sentience. But with this scarcity comes narrative depth. Each has their own reasons for fighting, names, and are distinguished by unique armor patterns. Those incapacitated by the player are transported to the nearest Temporary Detainment Center (TDC), and can be seen and talked to shortly after the mission.\nAfter the completion of a level, the player can revisit these locations whenever they choose. Droids will leave scattered remains where they were destroyed, and fallen allies will be carried off to the mortuary. The player can interact with newly stationed soldiers, NPCs that may have previously inhabited the area, and continue the search for secrets with their squad, if desired.\n\nEMPLACEMENT ZONES\nDestroy enemy emplacements to reveal drop zone locations for friendly equipment.) Gear needs to be powered, this connects it to an electricity source) Use scroll wheel to cycle through different gear drop when aimed on target. Study how RC reveals actionable locations (e.g. how close the mouse needs to be reveal the hologram) All human drops destroy the emplacement zone when destroyed, overloading it. Renlei drop zone equipment does not. And renlei AI can place new gear if the player leaves the zone open.\nEquipment drops include\n-Turrets (easy targets, but high damage) It has limited ammunition, adds resources to the recycler. \n- Sentries (weak, but high numbers) There's a limit to how many can spawn at once, but if a sentry is destroyed, nanites gather the parts and rebuild it at the spawn station. \n- Recyclers (non-combat) recycle used ammunition cartridges, but can only produce ammo so long as droids are being destroyed. They 'fill up' and discharge a full magazine to each member in the squad when maxed. They spawn in giving squad members max ammunition. \nOverloaded circuits can be repaired by squad members, but it's risky. (as this leaves them out in the open)\nRenlei projectiles melt away armor. Those materials can't be re-used. If a soldier loses all their armor, they're defenseless and need to be resupplied. Instead of revived.\nAmmo is represented by a rectangular colored area on the player/squad member's back. When the player reloads, they reach around and grab a handful of the nanites from that area and slaps them into their weapon. The action leaves a finger-shaped dent in the rectangular area, then the nanites reform rightmost into that shape. (It's an ammo bar on their back, but it makes sense in the lore!) Nanites are almost like a solidifying liquid. \nResupply a squad member by gripping their hand (almost like a handshake) this splits half the giver's armor and gives it to the receiver. (nanites are seen flowing from one arm to the other as this happens)\nArmor isn't made from nanites, but it's reshaped by them. Ammo is however, made of nanites. \nHumans are weak and vulnerable when their armor is stripped away. Fear builds up the longer they go without it.  Droids will crush them if they come close, and their deaths are irreversible and potentially traumatic. \nConvenient chest high armor is almost non-existent. The player must order NPC's to 'make cover' by knocking over furniture, ripping up steel floors, and breaking objects to create a line of sight. Suit must have visible exoskeleton!\nUse the F key to mark locations for supplies. Tap F to spawn energy reserves, ammo drops, turrets, explosives, etc. You only have a limited number of drop points in each location. They can't be re-used once the resource is expended.\n\nWEAPON DESIGN\nWeapons are great, but a lot of their great-ie-ness depends on how they're designed. Animation, damage feedback, and controllability all play a role in the weapon's overall feel.\nProjectiles and how they do what they do\nHuman weapons use projectiles that aren't designed to penetrate armor, but rather they're intended to dismantle it. These 'bullets ‘are laced with nanites that break down non-organic, metallic materials. The denser the material, the more nanites are required to break it down. Squads are trained to target weak points and disarm living hostiles non-lethally. How it work?\n\t* Droids do not need to be fully broken down, and can be quickly neutralized by targeting weak points. These areas vary depending on the type of unit and their total defense.\n\t* Once a living target's armor is dismantled, it is heavily encouraged that the player goes in and neutralize them via the melee button; this incapacitates the hostile non-lethally.\n\t* As the nanites only target metals, clothing remains unaffected. Renlei don't get nekked. \n\t* Nanite projectiles glow when they hit a target; color depends on player preference.\nSquad and player damage mechanics\nWeapons in Sentience are designed around a balance between Squad damage output, and player engagement. For example, if each of the six squad members is capable of outputting 15% of the total squad's damage, the player can only output another 10% with firearms. The squad cannot operate effectively without the player. While light enemies are quickly neutralized by their gunfire, the squad cannot fully disable heavier enemies promptly without help from the player's finishers. These finishers are used by targeting exposed enemy weak points, and tapping the melee button; this instigates a brief animation that destroys it.\n\nOther details and miscellaneous information \nThese weapons are set apart from those in traditional FPS games in several ways. – Hip fire is just as accurate as using iron sights or scopes and aiming does not slow the player's speed. With exception to the shotguns, weapons have very little bullet spread. Because of this detail, players can easily predict the behavior of each weapon; making them more enjoyable to use. Lastly, there is no reloading function; this would only slow down the gameplay experience.\n\nDESIGN PRINCIPLES\n\nDetails that should probably be in the main GDD\nSquad is designed to support the player as they engage enemies directly. e.g. They can focus fire on difficult targets while the player tackles lighter enemies, or the player can focus on the heavy enemies while they eliminate the smaller foes.\nAllies will help the player navigate the map by taking cover near the closest direction or path if they are unassigned to a position outside of combat. \nhidden areas are unhighlighted. tapping RMB will command squad members to open it. provide environment clues, like footprints or erosion on a wall\n\nterminals vary in the time it takes to slice. they're used to build tension and encourage planning before combat\nfailures should be as awesome as success in text games. both need to be interesting\n\t* intrinsic exposition\n\t* every mechanic exists in the game, nothing like hearts or abstract 'health bars' exist in game\n\t* spatial immersion\n\ndetermine the optimal game length and content for $15. find a way to encourage multiple play throughs. is it the choices? is new game plus an option? should levels be open to replay after the main game is completed?\nanimation telegraphing - displaying incoming attacks. charging weapons, preparing to swing, etc.\n\n\t* What is the final game's focus?\n\t* What level design should be utilized?\n\t* How are barriers used?\n\t* Is the world static (unchanging levels) or procedurally generated (random enemy spawn points, item locations, available routes, etc.)?\n\n\nHidden game design principles\n\n\nThe cinematics in Fallout New Vegas are just locking the player in a room looking at a projector while an NPC talks\nAll our games, on gamepad, trying to level down fast after looking up, the view will snap to horizon making you feel like you are precise.\nThe last bullet in Gears of War's magazines does smth like 25% extra damage to give you a better chance at finishing off foes.\nIs it ok to mention something we're proud of in our own game? :P  In Firewatch, a player not responding to dialogue prompt is a noted choice the game reacts to non-response, and it helps create a feeling that ignoring someone has social consequence and the other person is \"real\"\nMy favorite of these is an HL2 thing: Railings and ledges are set as \"ragdoll magnets\", so dead enemies fall over them more frequently.\nIn some LEGO games, ranged enemies have hit/miss probability - on a miss the projectiles are offset but also have no collision just in case This allows enemies to shoot really often to create a manic feeling of being under fire and to ensure players don't walk into an offset miss\nAll the Ratchet and Clank games I worked on hid enemies / scaled damage based on time played and number of deaths.\nIn F.E.A,R, we would bend bullets towards things that exploded. Cuz explosions are cool.\nIn Halo, bullets are calculated to run out at approximately the some time as shields, for that classic halo duel of reload, granade or punch Makes players feel like an action heroes, making quick and 'Rambo like' choices while low in health.\nIn Gears of War we made the last shot more powerful to make the odds of finishing the monster at the end of the magazine more likely\nAll good PC FPSs: holding movement key during a frame=1, pressing or releasing=0.5, pressing _and_ releasing during same frame=0.25 1/2 this gives you almost \"analog\" controls on a keyboard, so precise short-distance jumps are possible as if you had a gamepad. 2/2\nand of course the classic - enemies are less accurate if you have your back turned / running away. Made famous by Halo but used everywhere\nIn Furi, we designed the last phase of a bossfight to be visually more impressive but with a lower difficulty (> more chance of epic win).\nCrysis caps how many simultaneously firing enemies can hit you. Varies by difficulty. Creates \"running though hail of bullets\" feeling.\nBioshock 2, first encounter with big sister, fight will end when your health is a tiny fraction, regardless of how well or poorly you do... this is to make it feel like you got away by the skin of your teeth. Although you can just go stand near the exit and let her pummel you...\nIn Undertale, there is a timed segment where you have to get to a goal using a jetpack.Time slows down as you progress so you always make it\nin Hyper Light enemies are aware of each other; they give space when too many start crowding player so they don't feel overwhelmed\nEvery time you open a container in BioShock the game looks at your inventory and fills the container with what it thinks you need.\nTemp dropping enemy aim when the player hits crit health to allow for a heroic comeback. Features heavily in Bungie games (Halo, Destiny).\nThe goons in Uncharted have a 100% miss chance for the first couple of shots after you pop out of cover, to make firefights more rewarding.\nIn Halo, AI that are diving away from a grenade or incoming vehicle _prefer_ to dive off cliffs. So satisfying.\nIn Mass Effect 1 I did some timing on running vs walking the length of the citadel. Exact same times, but feels faster when running.\nAwesome thread! In The Force Unleashed, after killing a Jetpacktrooper, they'd always spiral out of control following the players crosshair\nEnemies firing at you from behind in Battlezone VR aim high to warn you they're there and mitigate death from an unseen opponent\nbrothers in arms adjusted enemy accuracy depending on if you played the game the \"right\" way--staying in cover, with your team, moving smart if you try and rambo, they get way more accurate and kill you right away it's similar to the fc4 accuracy thing, but not explicitly for player comfort. tries to get you into the mindset of a ww2 solider\nF.E.A.R's AI dialogue is selected by the NPC doing an action, then it tells another NPC to say it. Making it look like they communicate.\nAfter Half-Life 2 determines a shot will miss the player, it looks for something interesting it could hit instead, like an explosive barrel\nOther miscellaneous details and ideas \nweapon and armor texturing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd_QeY9uATA\nAuto-saves should be frequent so they can return to exactly where they left off, instead of replaying an entire level again. Is the player capable of death?\nAI systems\nAwesome per second\nGame must have engagement, mystery, mastery, mental challenge, narrative, novelty, flow\nWell refined multi-player profiles become an integral part of the game. Exclusive armor/weapon skins, permanent NPC, etc. (influential players or people who stream it)\nHalf Life 2, Quake, and Unreal Tournament allowed players to create their own content. (maps, for example). CSGO, Killing Floor, and Team Fortress 2 do the same thing, which is likely why players don't feel cheated in buying skins. Content updates (maps, new weapons) are free\nIf sequels are considered, be sure to port the old maps / missions / characters /mods into the new game if players owned the old game. If not, add it as cheap DLC. Each game contains a unique story with different characters. The stories take place during key events of the ongoing work. Each game is self-contained with their own themes, characters, and places. All missions are ported over to the successive game without the story original story elements (quips, conversation, comments, etc) \nDegamified Testing Cheats (Creative Mode)\n\t* Removing unlocks\n\t* Score/Leaderboards\n\t* Health/Ammo Limit\nR6S Philosophy\n\t* No community split!\n\t* We've made the commitment not sell maps and modes as we don't want to split our community. This means that all post launch maps & modes will be free.\n\t* No Pay Wall on Gameplay Content\n\t* We've decided to have all gameplay content accessible via playtime. If you keep playing the game, you'll be able to access post launch operators for free.\n\t* IMMEDIATE ACCESS - MAPS/GAME MODES\n\t* UNLOCK WITH PLAY TIME - OPERATORS/TIER 1 TO 3 WEAPON SKINS\n\t* BUY WITH R6 CREDITS TIER 4&5 WEAPON SKINS\nGame Design\n\t* -Role of the Player - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XlfeXpiSuQ\n\t* -Myth of the Gun - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os3lWIuGsXE\n\t* -Uncanny Vally - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K1Kd9mZL8g\nGame Development\n\t* -Starting off Right - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFU4tjMndi4\n\t* -Game Pacing - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LScL4CWe5E\n\t* -Skyrim's Opening - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpddXJJLhPY\n\t* -Game Cutscenes - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGXIR2dlktc\n\t* -Playtesting - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=on7endO4lPY\nNarrative\n\t* -Bad Writing - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG1ziCvLkJ0\n\t* -Diversity - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slJIiUTVXds \n\t* -Sex in Games - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP6gXZPVgD4\n\t* -Story Structure - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIQ6yWptvfA\n\t* -Female Characters - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qndga6SNU\n\t* -Race in Games - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mbOSB7EQpM\nMechanics\n\t* -Narrative Mechanics - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQJA5YjvHDU\n\t* -Tutorials 101 - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCPcn-Q5nKE\n\t* -Choice and Conflict - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg8fVtKyYxY\nDynamics\n\t* -Video Game Music - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKgHrz_Wv6o\n\t* -Graphics vs Aesthetics - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oK8UTRgvJU\nFinding the fun in FPS campaigns\nSubvert the trope of watching someone get killed as a new mechanic or enemy is introduced. (Mimics in Prey/Big Daddy's litter sisters in Bioshock) Give the player the option to 'break the glass' and save the person being attacked in that sequence.\n\nLEVELS & HUB\nThe second most important feature of Sentience is level design. Great mechanics, game-feel, and enemy design are nothing without well-designed areas to use them in. That's a rock fact.\nStructure of levels and progression\nLevels in Sentience can be accessed via the Navigation Terminal within the HUB. They branch out in a series of nodes that the player can access sequentially. Each branch introduces new mechanics, enemies, and locations. Levels are designed around the idea of squad control and the player's ability to quickly navigate a space. The player can utilize a wide array of tactics to prepare for incoming enemy forces. These tactics are often represented by objects that stand out from the game's environment. When a level is complete, it can be re-accessed in a post-battle state. The remnants of wrecked droids, projectile markings, and other debris left by the player remains largely untouched, but the area is now populated by the most relevant NPCs. \nIntroduction to new mechanics\nMechanics are introduced to the player in a number of ways. While some of these are visually represented by the armor pieces, most are available through the use of squad members and objects within the level. e.g. a Visor that introduces the enemy marking mechanic, or thermite and its role in breaching doors. These objects are brought to the player's attention with level design cues; light, architecture, enemy placement, VO hints, etc, and are needed to progress.\nFunctions of the HUB\nThe HUB (or Shelter) acts as the player's base of operations. Here, players can add or remove squad members, modify their weapon or suit appearance, plan for the next mission, and visit previously explored locations on their own. Squad members aren't present here, but they can be contacted by using a text-only console. They'll message the player regarding prior events, choices, or reach out for discussion on related topics. It also has room for additional features.\n\nMUSIC & SOUND\nAdaptive soundtrack (enemies are represented by instruments that play when nearby, music tempo alters with numbers, speeding up with more, slowing down with less. set threshold)\nSquad VO and general communication\nAssigned Tactical Position\n\t* Moving to cover!\n\t* Going to cover!\n\t* Taking position!\nSound of the enemy - UNFINISHED\nEnemies should make a noise when they spot you. Whetherit's a VO, sound effect, grunt, etc.\n\n\n\nINFLUENCES\n\t* Star Wars Republic Commando\n\t* Halo: Combat Evolved \n\t* DOOM (2016)\n\t* Wolfenstein: The New Order \n\t* Oxenfree \n\t* Titanfall 2\n\t* The Division\n\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/reorganize_GDD.docx.txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, character-design, dialogue, item, weapon, location, story, feature, gameplay, mechanic\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.186Z",

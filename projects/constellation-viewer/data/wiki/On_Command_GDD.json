The game is structured to felicitate a deep sense of control using squad commands and contextual actions. Its enemy types are distinguished by unique, but easily discernible behaviors, visual designs, and animations. Each of them designed to twist or manipulate the player's control over the battlefield and their wide array of tools. There are no cut-scenes or scripted, on-rails set pieces, and the story is told without taking away the player's control.\nWhy create this game?\nThe industry hasn't seen a tactical squad-based shooter in almost fifteen years. This isn't for a lack of interest though. Tom Clancy's produced most of games in the genre, but has since moved on to other IPs. Star Wars: Republic Commando was the most recent take on this type of video game design.\nWhere does the game take place?\nThe game takes place on the archipelago, Svalbard, 500,000 years from the present day. It's a desolate snowy landscape with long stretches of mountains and hills. Most of the player's time is spent within or near man-made structures and facilities, so the outside world isn't seen too often, but they will witness its extreme weather. Blizzards, snow storms, winds up to 30 m/s, thunderstorms, hail, and at night, the beautiful northern lights.\nWhat does the player control?\nThe player controls the squad leader, and has partial control of six squad members and their tool sets. Squad members can be ordered to perform contextual actions like taking cover, setting traps, slicing doors, etc., but are also capable of operating on their own (if ineffectively) without the player's orders.\nWhat’s different?\nGames like SWAT 4 had a steep learning curve, and a cluttered control set that made it hard to pick up and play. Star Wars: Republic Commando improved upon this by streamlining the game's controls, but lost a lot of the depth older squad-based shooters had. On Command aims to retain SWAT 4's depth, and streamline the game's mechanics to a few buttons. It's easy to pick up and play, but hard to master.\nGeneral Mechanics                                                                                              \nRemove third faction from On Command (Menesk) this only confuses the themes. Rebel faction in Noxii is aided by the colonists. Learn from how the Noxii GDD was built. Simplify things and separate the bulk of Narrative from gameplay in a separate document. Colonists should have an ACP solider in their squad instead of a Menesk civilian. Provides a basis for internal conflict. Build trust and lessen suspicion. This squad member should be male. Inherently less trusted. Replaces Arrisi from original concept.\nTime to Prepare (TTP)                                                                                                                       \nThis system is used before large waves or deadly encounters. Each encounter is designed to give the player an optimal amount of time for enemy engagements. (The amount of time is determined by playtesting) Time constraints are increased as the game's difficulty progresses; adding an element to the challenge curve. Unprepared players are less likely to win fights. \nStrategic Points (SP)                                                                                                                          \nOn Command uses Strategic Points that allows the player to strategize during combat. These SPs are carefully placed around levels to encourage interesting, and fun gameplay. Much of the cover found in game isn’t conveniently Chest High, instead, the player/squad will knock down, break, or move objects to create cover where positioned. If squad members enter combat without any assigned cover, they will automatically look for non-strategic points instead. \nActionable Object (AO)                                                                                                                    \nThese objects are secondary tools for the player or squad to use. Items like mines, turrets, terminals, entrances, etc. AOs are often scattered around levels, and can give the player a necessary advantage during enemy encounters. \nTerminals\nThese devices can be sliced into or disabled entirely. Slicing enables the squad to breach fortified doors, disable any nearby turrets, and even disable droids linked to the ACP power grid for charging. Enemies can reverse any of these changes by re-accessing the affected terminal, and this can be prevented by destroying the terminal permanently.\nEntrances\nAll visible entrances can be disabled or ‘sliced’ by the squad. Disabling these doors will increase the time it takes for enemies to get through, and slicing them will allow the squad to move through to the next area. The slicing process often leads to alarms which will require the player defend the assigned squad member until the doors are open.\nProximity Mines\nMines are great for setting traps before an ambush and come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. Some are literal mines that are placed on the floor; they’re deadly to the player/squad unless disabled or rewired. Crouching lets friendlies get close enough to tinker with them. Others aren’t mines at all, but potential traps that can be equipped with mines.\nOther Objects\nSome objects don’t have direct combat use, but serve the gameplay in other ways. Some objects can be moved to block entrances permanently, others can be scaled to secure a vantage point elsewhere in a room, and some aren’t immediately apparent as AOs, like NPCs that can be helped by the player or squad. Develop these where needed.\nEmplacement Zones (EZ)                                                                                                                  \nEZs are powerful tertiary tools that can only be built in specific locations. \nDeployer \nAn elevator-like device that transports units directly from the factory below. These machines can be gradual threat, but are quickly disabled with a well-timed charge.\nTurrets\nWhile the ACP’s variation of this machine operates autonomously, and cannot be commandeered by enemies. The Stellan version, however, must be piloted by a user. The player can order squad members to mount it, or operate it themselves. \nDistributors\nThis equipment is frequently found pre-positioned in earlier levels, but later levels will require the player assign them to emplacements manually. When activated for the first time, distributors will restore all health and ammo, but consecutive interactions won't provide any. Distributors will only restore ammo for standard weapons. Non-nanite or special ammo cannot be restored here.\nFriendly Deployer \nHuman squads are also supported by Drone counterparts, they're easily destroyed by M.A.G. rounds, but mass production gives them an advantage. Drones don't have a huge effect on the outcome of the battle, but they do provide the player with a slight edge that makes the early missions easier. They're deployed in limited numbers at the beginning of most missions.\nPlayer Mechanics                                                                                                 \nWords\nArmor                                                                                                                                                   \nIn On Command, nanites from a tough, malleable shell around Sentinel EVA suits. If a part of the shell is destroyed, the remaining nanites will coalesce and face the direction of incoming damage. For example, if a Sentinel takes a hit from the right shoulder, nanites from the left side of the body will migrate to fill that spot. Nanites can be replenished at Distributor EZs, but some enemy types will drop materials that nanites can use to self-replicate and restore armor.\n\nArmor is represented by a diegetic energy bar on the player's back. Akin to that found in the Dead Space franchise. The spine-like bar is colored bright red to contrast the white armor and to make its function immediately apparent. Damage causes the bar to flash, and as it gets closer to zero, it begins to pulse. The less health, the faster the pulse.\n\nIf a Sentinel loses all their armor, the EVA suit will force the user into a fetal position and enter a rigid state to protect them from harm. It will relax again when the suit attains more nanites. \n\nAmmo (Nanites)                                                                                                                                 \nAmmo in the game is universal for all weapons, but each weapon type uses them differently. Some may use one, or even multiple bars of ammo per shot, others may slowly drain the total pool, and some can replenish it at the expense of energy. \ncan be replenished by interacting with a distributor, or by finding it throughout levels. Looking for ammo when no distributors are available the primary motivation for player exploration. \n\nUser Interface                                                                                                                                     \nHUD elements must be diegetic in their representation. Meaning they exist in the game's fictional world and they are represented in the game's 3D space. Particles might be a good way to create UI that isn't physically represented on the character model. Character must always be on the left side of the screen, even when interacting with UI. Non-diegetic UI appears behind character. (options menu) All interactive UI must live around 1.5 meters above the ground plane. We set up a strict color language. Blue/White interaction. Red locked, not currently interactive. Orange/Amber ambient. Mimic the dead space locator, that keeps track of the main objective, while letting the player explore side locations. DON'T reveal tactical positions unless the player aims at them. Showing them right away doesn't let the player think for themselves. Playtesting will reveal optimal areas for tactical positions.\nCamera System                                                                                                                                   \nGive the player opportunities to find mirrors in the Gameworld. This reveals that the third person camera is a drone that follows the player. These drones use ARG projections to highlight objects in the world. Things like obscured teammate positions, outlining targeted enemies, and highlighting selected cover positions. Moving or aiming locks the camera to the character's back. Standing still lets the camera freely rotate around the player.\nPlayer Controls                                                                                                                                   \nMovement\n\t* Look: \t\tMove the MOUSE/RSTICK to rotate the camera. \n\t* Walk: \t\tHold W, A, S, or D/LSTICK to move in the desired direction. \n\t* Run:\t\tHold SHIFT+W, A, S, or D/LSTICK PRESS+LSTICK to run in the desired direction.\n\t* Enter Cover: \tTap SPACE/A BUTTON when near cover position. Players can also run into cover.\n\t* Change Cover: \tHold SPACE/A BUTTON while hovering RETICLE over desired cover to run towards it.\n\t* Roll: \t\tDouble tap SPACE/A BUTTON and W, A, S, or D/LSTICK to dodge in any direction.\n\t* Vault: \t\tHold SPACE/A BUTTON while in cover or near an obstacle to jump over it.\n\t* Crouch: \t\tTap CTRL/B BUTTON to reduce visibility; this does not increase a weapon’s accuracy.\n\t* Interact: \tPress or hold E/X BUTTON when near an actionable object.\n\t* Swap Shoulder: \tTap TAB/RSTICK PRESS to switch the camera angle.\n\t* Toggle ARD:\tTap H/D-PAD DOWN to toggle the Augmented Reality Display. (holographic elements)\nCombat\n\t* Weapon Radial: \tHold Q/Y BUTTON and rotate the MOUSE/LSTICK to select the weapon.\n\t* Fire Weapon: \tTap or Hold LMB/RT to fire your equipped weapon.\n\t* Reload Weapon:\tTap R/X BUTTON to reload your equipped weapon.\n\t* Aim Down Sights: \tTap MMB/LT to aim down the sights; this does not increase a weapon's accuracy.\n\nSocial\n\t* Choice 1: \t\tTap X/D-PAD LEFT to interrupt ongoing dialogue or Hold it to speak during opening.\n\t* Choice 2: \t\tTap C/D-PAD UP to interrupt ongoing dialogue or Hold it to speak during an opening.\n\t* Choice 3: \t\tTap V/D-PAD RIGHT to interrupt ongoing dialogue or Hold it to speak during opening.\nSquad Mechanics                                                                                                 \nThe squad is the most important mechanic in On Command. Every squad member has a distinct voice, personality, attributes, loadout, and skill proficiency. They are the player's most important set of tools.\n\nCommand Function                                                                                                                           \nThe player's use of commands will dictate the outcome of each encounter. If left unused, they will be at a severe disadvantage when fighting enemies. Basic commands are standard tools, necessary knowledge for realizing a squad's full potential. Object commands are linked to the external devices found throughout each level, and will often give the squad an edge in battle.\n\nSP Commands\nLet players assign basic cover anywhere. e.g. if there's a long barrier, section parts of the barrier off for assignment.\nEZ Commands\n\nTarget Commands\n(revives, target enemies, etc) If the player goes down, don't take away control. Let them move around still at a slower pace without weapons. The same goes for squad members. They can be ordered around still, albeit slower. Some characters will ignore Revive Cancel commands if the order was for someone they care about. \nBreach Commands\nLet the player choose to breach doors quietly to setup positions or loudly to go right into the fight. (the explosion kills a percentage of enemies for balance, their positions differ depending on the breach type) If it's a stealth breach, squad members will create vantage points using nanobots. e.g. disassembling a plant that's in the way instead of breaking the pot. Nanite deconstruction is slower.\nTrap Commands\n\nNon-Combat Commands\nYou can command squad mates to help people but doing that often means they'll stay behind to help. Making the level ahead more difficult.\n\nSquad Controls                                                                                                                                   \nGeneral Commands\n\t* Assign SP: \tTap F/RB on desired SP. Squad members will abandon old SP if given new ones. \n\t* Unassign SP: \tTap F/RB on occupied positions. This recalls the targeted squad member.\n\t* Unassign All SP: \tHold F/RB without selecting a target. This removes all squad members from active SP.\n\t* Cycle Squad:\tUse the SCROLL WHEEL/LB to cycle through teammates and highlights their positions.\n\t* Squad Radial: \tHover the RETICLE over target squad member. This brings up their weapon wheel. \nUse SCROLL WHEEL/LB+ROTATE RSTICK to select desired weapon.\n\nContextual Commands\n\t* Slice Terminal: \tTap F/RB on the desired terminal to gain access to it.\n\t* Wreck Terminal: \tHold F/RB on the desired terminal to destroy it.\n\t* Breach Entrance: \tTap F/RB on the desired door or entryway to break through.\n\t* Disable Entrance: \tHold F/RB on the desired door or potential entryway to stall access.\n\t* Revive Sentinel: \tTap F/RB on the desired squad member or non-player character.\n\t* Partition Sentinel: \tHold F/RB on a squad member to split their total energy reserves.\n\t* Disable Mine: \tTap F/RB on the mine to destroy it. \n\t* Rewire Mine: \tHold F/RB on the mine to enable it for ally use.\n\t* Move Object: \tHold F/RB on the object you want the squad to move.\n\t* Activate Capsule: \tHold F/RB to open the Nanite Distributor capsule. \n\t* Acquire Nanites: \tTap F/RB on the desired Nanite Distribution device.\n\t* Eject Cell: \tHold F/RB to remove power cell from the desired location.\n\t* Fortify SP: \tHold F/RB on a cover position to strengthen it.\n\t* Setup EZ: \tTap F/RB on an emplacement position.\n\t* Destroy EZ: \tHold F/RB on an emplacement position.\n\t* Cycle EZ: \t\tHover RETICLE over target and SCROLL/LB+ROTATE RSTICK to select equipment. \n\t* Assign EZ:\tHold F/RB over emplacement after cycling to the one desired.\n\t* Assign Target: \tTap F/RB on enemy to tell a unit to ignore all other enemies until this one is disabled.\n\t* Squad Target: \tHold F/RB on enemy to tell squad to ignore all other enemies until this one is disabled.\n\nCommunication & Feedback                                                                                                            \nSquad members elicit a sense of urgency in carrying out orders and act on them in a similar fashion; this is demonstrated by using quick animation, well-designed sound, and quality VO. This will require expert programming, as ineffective AI will negatively affect the gameplay. Glottal stops. (dialogue interruptions) When the player character gives commands, they will often shout the corresponding character’s name, and that character responds to communicate the command was received.\nSquad HUD Information                                                                                                                   \nTactical positions are highlighted when the player's crosshair aligns with it. White represents an unassigned position and colored represents an assigned position. Squad member icons flash when they talk. If the player hovers the mouse over an active tactical position, the game will highlight the corresponding icon. Symbols overlay the squad icons to represent states like out of cover, in cover, moving to cover, looking for cover, help in progress, object in use, etc.\nClasses & Abilities                                                                                                                              \nClasses aren't a single thing someone does. Everyone can do any task (to make the game easily accessible), but every solider has a task their best at, and a task their terrible at.\nTechnician\nSlices/locks doors faster, sets/defuses devices quicker. Distinguished by unique optical tool on helmet.\n\n\t* Setting Traps \t(Technician Bonus)\n\t* Defusing Traps \t(Technician Bonus)\n\t* Slicing Doors \t(Technician Bonus)\n\t* Locking Doors \t(Technician Bonus)\n\nStrategist\nCan quickly establish and fortify cover positions, and moves faster between them. Distinguished by third robotic arm mounted on shoulder.\n\n\t* Cover Setup\t(Strategist Bonus)\n\t* Fortify Cover \t(Strategist Bonus)\n\nEnforcer\nReinforces, equips, and repairs emplacement zones quicker. Distinguished by specialized nanite dispenser on back.\n\t* Fortify EZ \t(Enforcer Bonus)\n\t* Repair EZ \t(Enforcer Bonus)\n\t* Equip EZ\t\t(Enforcer Bonus)\nPlayer & Squad Weapons                                                                                   \nWeapon that replenishes ammo at the expense of energy. \n\nPlayer & Squad Projectiles                                                                                                               \nHuman weapons use projectiles that aren't designed to penetrate armor, but rather they're intended to dismantle it. These ‘bullets’ are laced with nanites that break down specific types of non-organic, metallic materials. The denser the material, the more nanites are required to break it down as this process quickly exhausts their limited fuel.\n\n\t* Droids do not need to be fully broken down, and can be quickly neutralized by targeting weak points. These areas vary depending on the type of unit and their total defense.\n\t* Once a living target's armor is dismantled, it is heavily encouraged that the player goes in and neutralize them via the melee button; this incapacitates the hostile non-lethally.\n\t* As the nanites only target metals, clothing remains unaffected. ACP don't get nekked. \n\t* Nanite projectiles glow when they hit a target; color depends on player preference.\n\nSquad members are given a lethal weapon at some point. The squad lead can command them to equip and use it on ACP soldiers. Official weapons have swappable attachments like RC. Player can also carry one additional non-official weapon.\n\nWeapon Feel                                                                                                                                       \nWhen designing weapons, assign a unique time signature to each of them e.g. a slow firing, booming rifle that uses a 4 4 beat, a deep-bass pump-action shotgun that uses a 3 4 beat, and a resounding sniper that uses a 6 8 beat. Make each of them feel powerful and satisfying with the use of sound design and animation.\n\nWeapon Types                                                                                                                                    \nRifle\nWeapon Function\nWeapon Feel\nShotgun\nWeapon Function\nWeapon Feel\nPistol\nWeapon Function\nWeapon Feel\nLauncher\nWeapon Function\nRocket launcher that EMPs anything it hits. Great for disabling turrets and temporarily stunning larger enemies. All enemies have EM shielding. Therefore, it doesn't permanently disable them. They'll reboot when this happens.\nWeapon Feel\nEnemy Mechanics                                                                                                \nEnemies in On Command vary from the sparse ACP soldiers, to the hulking, mass-manufactured machines that litter every level. They're designed to keep the player active and engaged and actively using their squad’s abilities. Each enemy type has a set of consistent, discernible behaviors that can be learned and countered. They all share a common theme, but are also visually and audibly distinct from one another.\nEnemy Projectiles                                                                                                                              \nThe ACP military doesn't use traditional low-cost ballistics, instead they projectiles known as 'malleable acidic gelatinous' (M.A.G.) rounds that are designed to slowly break down armor. These projectiles are intended to be visible to the player, vary in shape, color, speed, and damage depending on the type of enemy shooting. At impact, this viscid substance begins a chemical reaction that works to incinerate the affected material; only dissipating once the projectile has expended its fuel. They can be avoided by using cover and cannot destroy it. Renlei soldiers developed acidic rounds because normal ballistics weren't effective in local conflict. Acidic rounds were needed to break through dense metal armor.\nEnemy Health Systems                                                                                                                      \nWhile smaller enemies can be eliminated with a few well-placed projectiles, tougher units will have layers of armor that require team coordination to break through, and weak points can be exploited to destroy or hinder enemy units. Joints are often the weakest parts of enemies\nEnemy Types                                                                                                                                       \nGyre\nEnemy Description\nBasic enemy that rolls up into a thin-ish cylindrical form and moves towards its objective at a very fast pace. They are a threat in large numbers, and can be deployed indefinitely from a dispenser. They serve as the backbone of the ACP army and have several variations.\nEnemy Combat Flow\nRoll towards enemy or enemy emplacement. If outer shell is damaged, unroll and return fire. Do as much damage as possible while avoiding damage to self. If near emplacement, attempt to set charges. Equip friendly emplacement when emplacement zone is not occupied. If low health, roll back up and attempt to avoid incoming enemy fire. Find an interesting way to die\nUltra Gyre\nEnemy Description\nA heavier, more armored version of the Gyre with a huge health pool. The Ultra Gyre has two adjacent outer shells that create an X shape. It moves and unrolls slower than its counterpart, has dual cannons that can target two simultaneous enemies, and unrolls to reveal a machine that makes the standard Gyre look harmless. It requires full squad cooperation to take down.\nEnemy Combat Flow\nRoll towards player position and unroll when X amount of damage is dealt to outer shells or X distance from player is reached. If unrolled, select two enemy targets and shoot at both simultaneously. If internals are exposed, move towards single target at 2x speed, pick them up and crush them. If low health, explode and destroy cover or severely damage enemy.\nDredge\nEnemy Description\nTread driven enemy with large health pool that slowly moves towards enemy cover. It comes equipped with drilling equipment that can be used to destroy enemy cover. The dredge has a high-density metal body but lacks the ability to shoot projectiles. These droid units are much higher priority than Gyre or ACP Soldiers and often require team coordinate to eliminate.\nEnemy Combat Flow\nMove towards occupied enemy cover and attempt to destroy it. If target cover is successfully destroyed, pursue the enemy behind it and target whichever cover they use next. If one tread is lost, continue moving towards objective at slower pace with lower cover damage. If cover isn't destroyed on first hit, back up and re-attempt. If low health, veer into nearest non-cover obstacle. If no occupied cover is available, move towards nearest enemy and charge at them.\nScope\nEnemy Description\nDeals massive damage, but charges weapon before firing. This unit has very low health, but defends itself using mobile cover that can be deployed and retracted within a few seconds. It uses this tool to move closer to the target while risking brief vulnerability. Enemy with low health that targets enemies out of cover. Uses periscope and remains hidden until enemy leaves cover.\nEnemy Combat Flow\nFind cover, wait for enemy to change positions, eliminate them as they run. Repeat until damaged. If periscope is destroyed, suppress enemies that are actively in cover. Retreat and keep using cover. Retreat and die in the process. (Bullet magnet enemy NPC projectiles)\nSiphon\nEnemy Description\nFlies into the battlefield and latches onto the first enemy target in range. It'll slash into armor and connect directly to the power supply, and drain energy for as long as it can. The affected user can remove it on their own, but it's quicker to have it removed by an ally.\nEnemy Combat Flow\nAvoid gunfire while circling friendly units and re-assemble destroyed droids; creating weaker versions. Throw sharp and or blunt droid parts at enemies in range. Spin out of control and shock a friendly unit, stunning them momentarily.\nSiren\nEnemy Description\nA lanky biped that darts around the map leaning over cover to stun squad members with deafening sound. This prevents the squad member from giving or receiving orders for a short period of time.\nEnemy Combat Flow\nRun towards nearest enemy position, wait several seconds, and pop over cover to stun them. Run towards nearest enemy position, stun them immediately but blow up in the process. Die in an interesting way.\nVector\nEnemy Description\nWeak but incredibly adept at traversing the environment quickly. Deadlier variant of the Dredge unit. They can disable cover at a distance using electric traps. These traps are linked to the unit that threw them. Destroying it, disables all the thrown electric traps.\nEnemy Combat Flow\nAvoid damage, get close to enemies while darting around the map. Use cover as often as possible. Avoid damage and get close to enemies. Use cover sparingly and be very aggressive. Die while in motion and collide with interesting things. (Bullet magnet enemy NPC projectiles)\nSoldier\nEnemy Description\nAs the ACP's basic infantry unit, these soldiers are supplied with standard armor and gear. They can use cover, equipment, and avoid attacks, but are quick to take down. Unlike droids, these organic soldiers must be neutralized using non-lethal tactics. don't cover ACP soldier faces\nEnemy Combat Flow\nGame Narrative                                                                                                    \nThe narrative in On Command isn’t presented with cutscenes, audio logs, or lengthy essays.

The name derives from the library of Alexandria, a sanctuary for knowledge. Humans that are born in the cities are predictable. That predictability is destroyed if they leave the city and are exposed to external variables.

ACP civilization was a massive research facility filled with civilians. A military force opposed to the launch of the probes occupies the city as a base of operations.\n\nHistory\nthe ACP was against the construction of the repopulator while the rest of world supported it. They landed on Svalbard with the intent to destroy the operation. They were 'defeated' by those that defended it before the asteroid struck. Renlei ancestors believed the repopulation project was a severe misuse of Earth's resources. Efforts should have been focused on preserving what remained of humanity on Earth. They fought the Menesk ancestors to stop the rockets from launching. Renlei don't live underground. The menesk are well-aware of their existence, but the two groups have gone without interaction for so long, that they've become different species (speciation by division). The war begins over territorial dispute.\nHistory                                                                                                                                                  \n500,000 years prior to the game’s timeline.

Probes scatter across the galaxy. One was programmed by the project's creator. If it was revealed where it would land or what he was doing, it would compromise the probe's safety. So he kept it a secret.\nPotential plot holes\n1. Why weren't the nanites used to prevent super bug infections?\n2. If an asteroid struck, how was oxygen maintained in the Menesk civilization if the ocean's algae dies out?\nThemes                                                                                                                                                \nIdeas for themes that aren’t quite set in stone. \n\t* New technologies aren’t inherently bad.\n\t* Optimistic science fiction.\n\t* Weapons that don’t kill.\nChoosing a theme\n\t* Is your theme something you're into?\n\t* Does your theme support the game mechanics?\n\t* Does your theme communicate the goal?\n\t* Does your theme have familiarity and novelty?\nLevels & HUB                                                                                                        \nTutorial                                                                                                                                                \nWhile ‘On Command’ has controls that are very similar to other titles in the genre, there are some aspects that differ. Squad commands occupy the F button, or they key that would usually be assigned to aiming down the sights. To teach them this difference, ask the player to aim at a tactical position, they might try to aim down sights of their weapon and discover the squad command key. Once this is learned, display that middle-mouse button is used to aim down the sights and reiterate to them that F is used to issue commands.\nSecrets & Hidden Areas                                                                                                                    \nEvery level has secrets to find. While opening a hidden entrance may often reveal something simple like an EZ for a Distributor, they might also unlock cosmetic sets, expose previously hidden tactical positions, and even yield alternative routes. Squad members will often reveal information about the location they're in; subtle expositional dialogue that not only serves to provide setting and tell you more about that character, but sometimes reveals secret areas. Secrets don't always have a tangible reward, and may instead surprise or entertain the player in unique ways. Some 'secrets' may also take the form of glitches or bugs, pay close attention.\nCheck Points                                                                                                                                       \nDesign checkpoints carefully to improve a player’s odds of sticking with the game until it’s finished. Don’t force them to go through dialogue or cinematic events before getting back to where they left off. Respect the player’s time. \nChapter Select                                                                                                                                    \nIn the game, chapter selection doesn’t become available until the player has completed the game or until the Cheat code to unlock it is entered. After choosing a chapter, players must then select the choices they made until that point in the story. This is an alternative that can prevent Save Scumming, a habit that takes players out of the game.\nMusic & Sound                                                                                                     \nUtilize the illusion of a powerful Shepard Tone to carry the combat forward. Interstellar, Dunkirk, etc.\nOther Details                                                                                                         \n\t* NPCs look at who they're talking to. Turning heads, nodding and using body expression.\n\t* Bodies will disappear to conserve graphical resources, but player can modify the timer.\nthe game HUB acts as a base of operations. it gives the player down time to talk to NPCs and interact with them. the walls are like giant monitors that give the illusion of larger space. (small area with invisible walls. the external area is varied and interesting) lush forests, icy tundra, etc.\nDo & Do Not                                                                                                          \n\t* Do throw the player right into the action (Learn from 1997's Shadow Warrior)\n\t* Do play-test the game as it's being developed (This is crucial)\n\t* Do create distinguished and balanced weapons, each one must function uniquely\n\t* Do release mod tools a year after release (This will prolong the game's life)\n\t* Do release game assets (Plan file structure, keep things readable, soft code all of it)\n\t* Do mirror Warframe’s Steam Workshop (Players submit skins, devs accept or reject them)\n\t* Do encourage exploration (Use paths, ammo, and health - reward with secrets)\n\t* Do include Easter Eggs (Alternative weapon skins, armor skins, and others)\n\t* Do release a demo (Break conventional aversion to releasing a quality demo)\n\t* Do use dynamic difficulty (Don't advertise it, challenge without stress, flow state)\n\t* Do use raycasting or hitscan for player ballistics (Best game feel, immediate feedback)\n\t* Do use the Vulkan API instead of DirectX 12 (Open source is a definite goal)\n\t* Do encourage periods of rest and reflection on your journey (Learn from Life is Strange)\n\t* Do be careful with sales (50%, 75%, etc. are hard to come back from)\n\t* Do pay attention to Steam's revenue growth by country (Determine localizations)\n\t* Do reduce the number of buttons required (Avoid the sea of buttons crutch)\n\t* Do publish an official Steam Controller configuration (Avoid having a game launcher)\n\t* Do develop a port for Linux and optimize the game with AMD GPUs in mind\n\t* Do use a projection protagonist; acts as a vessel for the player, lacks their own backstory \n\t* Do use Steam cloud to back up saves, but encourage players to back up data manually\n\t* Do release tangible copies once development has ceased for the single-player\n\t* Do support unexpected resolution ratios; keep the aspect ratio open-ended\n\t* Do ignore the standards for game length, and focus on quality over quantity\n\t* Do design the first level last; this is the best way to incorporate everything learned\n\t* *Do enable local co-op and provide lots of options (ways to split, multiple monitors, etc.)\n\t* Do mimic the Skyrim loading screen. Let players manipulate objects and provide info.\n\t* Do use a minimalistic start screen. (Alien: Isolation, Xenoblade Chronicles, The Last of Us)\n\t* Do hint towards new enemies before introducing them in combat (safe demonstration) \n\t* Do keep cosmetics skin oriented, let players buy them for a set price. e.g. $2.00~$5.00\n\t* Do let the player unlock cosmetic armor attachments as a reward for playing the game well\n\t* Do let the player adjust gameplay variables via cheats; mirror Celeste’s Assist Mode system\n\n\t* Don't hold the player's hand (Assume they are familiar with shooter games)\n\t* Don't use cut-scenes to tell the game's story (Learn from Portal)\n\t* Don't take control away from the player (Learn from Half Life)\n\t* Don't front-load the tutorial (Learn from Super Mario 64)\n\t* Don't launch the game in Early Access (Unfinished games make for bad first impressions)\n\t* Don't attempt an open world game (Quality is more important than quantity)\n\t* Don't add mechanics without reason (e.g. weapon fire modes or stamina bars)\n\t* Don't add running mechanic (Better for pacing and greater attention to level design)\n\t* Don't use Skinner Boxes (Repetition and grinding do not make a fun game)\n\t* *Don't add stealth mechanics (This is only an issue when considering the project's scope)\n\t* Don't add an upgrade system (This adds nothing to the game's existing mechanics)\n\t* Don't create linear levels (Emphasize on exploration and finding alternative paths)\n\t* Don't shy away from backtracking, utilize it (Learn from 2013's Tomb Raider)\n\t* Don't add mini-maps (Use environment or AI for guidance; squad VO hints at paths)\n\t* *Don't add a loot system (Skins are OK, but they must be rewarding to obtain)\n\t* Don't announce updates unless they're significant and ready (new missions, etc.)\n\t* *Don't use exploding barrels unless their placement makes sense in the world\n\t* Don't use loot crates for ammo/health (Learn from 2016's DOOM)\n\t* *Don't launch a Kickstarter unless a prototype is available and fully functional\n\t* Don't add weapon fire modes (z, x, c, should be used for dialogue choices)\n\t* Don't add reload function (Reloading forces the player to retreat or use cover)\n\t* Don't plaster the screen with unlocks and scores after each level (idgaf about score)\n\t* Don't spoil the game with trailers that reveal exciting events or give away plot twists\n\t* Don't give away secret areas with any obvious indication e.g. cracks or glimmer\n\t* Don't let NPCs repeat dialogue; especially when they're instructing the player\n\t* Don't use audio or text logs for story; choice-oriented dialogue is more engaging. \nFuture Proofing                                                                                                    \n\t* Game logic should not be tied to frame rates (Many console ports fall into this trap)\n\t* Make the game open source a year after release (Plan for mod tools ahead of time)\n\t* Include Steam Workshop support as soon as the game becomes open source.\n\t* Release a non-steam version that is DRM free. This may enable the game to live forever.\n\t* Simple weapon/armor skins can be earned in game; elaborate ones can be purchased \n\t* Allow for dedicated servers, but emphasize on peer to peer connection and LAN\n\t* Learn from SOMA's file structure; every asset is accessible, quick to replace and modify\n\t* At minimum, integrate basic VR support for the HTC Vive; full support if possible\n\t* Provide support for multiple-monitor layouts; ultra-widescreen, helmet cams, maps, etc.\n\t* Use Tessellation to scale models for a computer's performance; allow for configuration\n\t* Add the game to Creative Commons 3.0 BY-NC-ND when content production ends\n\t* Game should support Dynamic Resolution to improve performance for older cards.\nNew Content                                                                                                         \nInstead of expanding upon existing stories, new content should focus on alternative points of view during the conflict. New characters, enemies, weapons. Build upon old mechanics while adding new ones. Expansions instead of 'extensions'. (Free) DLC might use similar mechanics from the perspective of Grand Voss or the ACP, but add new variety, such as controlling a droid squad. \nHow do you want us to fund future content for On Command? Regardless what people choose. Put a progress bar that indicates how close we are to developing new content. Ask the community what they'd be willing to pay for cosmetics. In-Game Donations Recent Donations, list of players Progress bar that indicates when free DLC can begin development\nFunding After Breaking Even                                                                                                           \nArmor skins can be purchased in-game for a set price. e.g. $5.00 Each purchase adds to a bar that illustrates how money much is needed before the next major update can be developed. If there aren't any skins people want, they can purchase tokens that can be traded for skins in the future. Make a point that these purchases are donations.\nInfluences                                                                                                              \n\t* Star Wars Republic Commando\n\t* Halo: Combat Evolved \n\t* DOOM (2016)\n\t* Wolfenstein: The New Order \n\t* Oxenfree \n\t* Titanfall 2\n\t* The Division\nControls & Options                                                                                              \nGame Options                                                                                                                                    \n\t* Field of View: Slider \t(50-200)\n\t* Toggle Crouch: \t\t(On/Off)\n\t* Toggle Aim Down Sights:\t(On/Off)\n\t* Enable Controller UI: \t(On/Off)\n\t* Controller UI Type: \t(XBOX/PlayStation/Steam Controller)\nVideo Options                                                                                                                                     \n\t* Vsync: \t\t\t(On/Off)\n\t* FPS Limit: Slider \t\t(30-300)\n\t* Refresh Rate: Slider \t(30-300)\nGraphics Options                                                                                                                               \nThe number of options available must be visible without selecting!\n\t* Texture Resolution: \t(Low-720p/Med-1080p/High-1440p/Ultra-4k)\nCheat Codes                                                                                                                                        \n\t* Unlock Level Select: \tantisavescumming\n\nPlayer must put a squad mate in danger. (make it clear that they might die) if they choose no one, time does progress and the members choose for themselves. When the player does choose someone, a different squad mate steps in and insists they do it instead. (this person is potentially a character the player cares about more than the one they selected) Can the player step in themselves?\nOn command is a squad based 'stealth' action game. 'stealth' in this game is only the preparation phase. you can surround enemies before engaging and mark everyone's targets. they attack when you do. this makes it easier to plan engagements. it's not intended for 'full' stealth fights\nThe atlas pillars open 250 years after hold humanity arrived. the AEI wakes up after an Atlas pillar is damaged some years prior, notices the humans, and prepares for contact by producing colonists. When they finally open, millions of new humans pour from the base of these immense structures. old humanity is prosperous for years after this happens. laws are modernized, technology advances, education improves, and the overall quality of live gets better. after some time though, new humanity is persecuted for the sake of another war. people to rally against. the war advocates say they had nothing to do with the advancement of their society and that NH do nothing to participate. they claim all these advances were made by OH.\nAEI shut down after completing the task of building the dyson swarm and planet engines/atlas pillars. therefore, the AEI does not help, and the ship is inaccessible\nThe AI oversaw the development of this tech. Humans were 'grown' later when they were needed for communication with old humanity.\n\n\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: on-command-wiki-pages/On_Command_GDD.txt\n- **Type**: wiki\n- **Tags**: wiki, on-command-wiki-pages, character-design, dialogue, item, weapon, location, story, gameplay, mechanic, bug\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.227Z",

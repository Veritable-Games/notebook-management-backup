Can I go back\nhistory and save reference logs or idea logs or channel logs or whatever. Idea.\n\n\n====== REC006.txt ======\nWhat if you save an animation cost?\nYou 3D printed a puppet that had points of tracking on it.\nThat would be an interesting way to create keyframes.\nOne more dynamic, one more intuitive.\nYou can just take a photo of it really.\nParts for us making it a trickle-it.\nYou might want to get a sideshow-collectible figurine with a puzzle of fingers or replaceable hands.\nHmm.\nYeah, it's fucking extraordinary.\n\n\n====== REC007.txt ======\nThe diamond takeer he should dissipate in a close space.\n\n\n====== REC008.txt ======\nThat is to say, the idea already is of a given social space, with minimal insulation\nand an extreme insulation like trees and stuff, that's the insulation shield to keep\nheat within a space, and then you have people, and to keep the space insulated you had to\nbring people close together. It's just a practical design, so you take the median temperature\nof the overall planet, you know, it's negative 50 degrees, or it's really good, it's\nnegative 60 degrees Celsius. No, I have to warn that, I'll figure out the number later.\nAnyway, you have the outside air being colder than the inside air, and the inside air is warming\nup to two bodies being active, the trees and the people, and whatever gets too cold, the\nDodeck hatch, to warm the space further, the player characters navigate through the space,\nand they're using a mirror's edge, a mirror's edge, and a true mirror like navigation system,\nso the player is reaching out and grappling, but in grappling, that exerted heat is exaggerated\nbecause it's a machine, it's dense, it's a powerful mechanism, and it jumps further,\nit's a typical human piece of a lot, and the arm is like a grappling maneuver, and you're\ngrappling in from one point to another, it's like it's a good entertaining way, but it's not too\nexaggerated, it's slightly exaggerated, so it's like a huge jump, 30% farther than\nwhen you would otherwise, and that extra boost is the fun bit, it's like years of war\nactive reload system, you jump, you jump again, you jump again, and it's like you're doing\nthe, you go to time it, you jump, imagine like your character jumps up, imagine\nthat there's two, two adjacent planes, you've got to jump further, but it's below you,\nso you've got to jump in between the arc, so like you, on the top one, you jump out, you\nwork down, you've got to go further, so you boost yourself a little bit, and now you're on\nthe other platform, below it, so imagine that you're climbing up or climbing around,\nor climbing between, you know, parallel to, or with the running and the jumping and\nthe boosting between jumps and climbs, so like you do that too, and that's how you\nmake an interesting and engaging climbing system, but then here's the catch,\nit goes further, imagine you have these, these legs, these arms, they're grappling\nout, but you can also use them for conversation, the body can be used to express,\nand when you're not climbing, you're not running, you're not, you know, maneuvering,\nmode when you're talking to people, when you're engaged with a topic with someone,\nthat's when your character starts to express, they can use the symbols of the\nDodeck to communicate, that's another tangent for later, but anyway, as you jump\nup a heat, heat exertion, and imagine your character won't be able to move\nvery much, because there he is, they don't sweat like humans, but they can,\nand that can be done through steam exertion, so the machine builds a\nheat, and then it exerts steam, as it builds up, or when it gets really high,\nbut you need more water to produce more steam, to lower the overall temperature,\nso when you reach the bond fire, so to speak, up this metric running on like path,\npathing system, you need to find water sources to neutralize\na little faster, neutralize your overall temperature faster, it takes a while,\nit takes a little bit, you know, it's not, it's a passive mechanic,\nheat the player kind of, localized for a little bit, that's like two or three\nminutes, maybe a minute and thirty seconds, you know, anyway,\nit's enough to help the player engage, they can see you coming,\ncoming down, they can rest, to cool down faster, and sit down,\nand then, you know, now instead of a minute thirty seconds,\nit's like forty-five, fifty seconds, or they can go find a water source,\nfill up their canteen and drink, or just smash their head in the water,\nand drink that way, or whatever, I don't know.\nIt could be a little more animalistic, like a cat or a dog,\nor a human before they had the tools, and then they're given the players,\ngiven the tool to drink later on by someone that was kind enough.\nOkay, you want to hand this to the canteen?\nI don't know, to get the can, they can't be given the canteen to begin with.\nUh, that's, yeah, that's better.\nThat way it's like they know where they have to drink water.\nHey?\nOkay, have fun out there.\nTake your time.\nDon't forget to drink water.\nHey, take your time exploring.\nUh, hey, don't, don't forget to drink water.\nI need it.\nDon't forget to hydrate.\nIs what she says.\nBecause prior to this, the player had known in this mechanic\nbecause the robot, uh,\nthrew up a form.\nThe basic form was running around and walking.\nAnd that form is, uh,\nit overheats with the legs.\nIt can't climb, but it can navigate.\nSo this, that they are the Dota character,\nthat secondary form isn't more,\nit means a means of more interesting navigation.\nSo if you're agree, you go on.\nOh boy.\nOkay, I gotta take care of the end of the sign document.\n\n\n\n## Metadata\n- **Source**: All of it Anything Everything At Once/11_NOV_2019_-_New_folder_(26).txt\n- **Type**: document\n- **Tags**: document, All_of_it_Anything_Everything_At_Once, character-design, dialogue, story, mechanic\n- **Imported**: 2025-05-05T16:25:37.013Z",

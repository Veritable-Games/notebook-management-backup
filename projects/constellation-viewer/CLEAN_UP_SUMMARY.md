# Wiki System Clean-up Summary

This document provides a summary of the clean-up actions taken to resolve coherence issues in the Constellation Viewer wiki system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Port Standardization
- Standardized all port references to use port 8080 consistently
- Updated server.js to listen on port 8080
- Updated start-wiki.sh and stop-wiki.sh to use port 8080
- Fixed all documentation to reference the correct port

### 2. Removed Deprecated Interfaces
- Removed enhanced-wiki.html, enhanced-wiki.js, and enhanced-wiki.css
- Removed basic-styled.html which had been superseded
- Removed redundant start scripts (start-enhanced-version.sh, start-styled-wiki.sh)
- Removed redundant stop scripts (stop-styled-wiki.sh)

### 3. Cleaned Up Redundant Files
- Removed server.js.bak, server.js.bak2, server.js.bak4, server.js.bak_port
- These backup files were creating confusion and inconsistency

### 4. Updated Start/Stop Scripts
- Improved start-wiki.sh with better error handling and file checking
- Enhanced stop-wiki.sh with more robust process termination
- Made both scripts executable
- Added consistent error messages and status reporting

### 5. Updated Documentation
- Revised README.md to reflect current functionality
- Updated feature list to accurately represent capabilities
- Provided clearer usage instructions
- Added links to relevant documentation

## Current Implementation

The wiki system now uses a single, consistent implementation:

1. **Interface**: wiki.html, wiki.js, and wiki.css
2. **Backend**: server.js with standardized API endpoints
3. **Port**: Consistent use of port 8080
4. **Scripts**: start-wiki.sh and stop-wiki.sh for management

## Future Improvements

While this clean-up resolves the immediate coherence issues, the following improvements could be made in the future:

1. Implement wiki search indexing for better performance
2. Add version history for wiki pages
3. Enhance notebook integration with bidirectional links
4. Improve the wiki editor with syntax highlighting
5. Add user authentication and edit permissions

## Conclusion

The wiki system is now more coherent and maintainable. All components work together consistently, and redundant or deprecated features have been removed. Documentation has been updated to accurately reflect the current state of the system.

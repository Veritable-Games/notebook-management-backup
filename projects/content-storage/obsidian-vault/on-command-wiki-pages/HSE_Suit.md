# HSE Suit
Hermetically Sealed Environment Suit
original armor looks like EVA suits. Newer armor looks more akin to Halo power armor
daredevil mask - no eye sockets. possible design for helmet
armor addons create visual variation if the armor design never changes (with exception to skins, of course)
EVA Suits are essentially 'under-armor' and the defense plating is stacked on top of it.
Use exo-armor to augment strength. Male and Female soldiers only differ in weight. It can also be used in sports to balance physical power.

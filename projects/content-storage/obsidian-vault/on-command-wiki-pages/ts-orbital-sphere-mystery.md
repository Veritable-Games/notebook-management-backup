In a world where a mysterious artificial sphere orbits the planet, a dedicated scientist delves into understanding its origins and purpose. This massive, low-density object, larger than the planet itself, puzzles researchers with its enigmatic construction and unknown interior. As they explore its possible functions and origins, the scientist grapples with both logical analysis and emerging spiritual interpretations within their society. The narrative explores the balance between scientific inquiry and human curiosity, highlighting how ancient and modern civilizations fill gaps in understanding with both facts and beliefs. The story unfolds as they theorize about the sphere's role, from potential planetary defense to an energy source, while contemplating the broader implications of unknown phenomena on societal beliefs and human progress.

[...]
All right, so this is really cool.
Let's see.
So give me a perspective on one person in the world.
Let's say a scientist, someone who has intrigued,
someone who has the initial curiosity of this planet.
Okay.
So you would have to imagine if those scientists knew this is someone
that has a pretty solid understanding of how things
probably will come at that point.
So they're understanding the atmosphere, the environment itself.
Yeah, you would have to guess.
The focus on that structure.
They probably have a pretty good understanding of the rest of it.
So it's interesting.
Okay, I didn't mention this, but there is a sphere hanging.
It's larger than the planet.
It's a sphere.
It's hanging in the orbit above the planet.
What's interesting about this is that the sphere is not dense enough to be a moon.
It's not dense enough to be a planet.
It's more like a moon in terms of density.
So it's a larger object.
The road takes the planet, but it's less dense.
Do they understand it is artificial?
They have investigated and they find that it's artificial.
They can't find the means inside the structure.
Another hypothesis here.
Another thing they might posit.
Or hell.
There could be a marking on there, but let me explain.
So this sphere is supposed to divide into,
and then take the ring world itself and attach to it.
And encapsulating the planet.
And enabling the ring world itself to ignite the engines.
So it's like an incubator that protects the planet as it moves.
Because despite space being so large, there is debris that could damage the planet and transit.
So it's meant to be both a housing for the energy,
all the energy that this thing is collected to use for power, use for fuel.
And then you have the interior of that structure that they are supposed to be there.
So they don't know what the inside is at all?
They do not.
So there's a scientist you'd have to look at it like this.
You have two ports of the equation.
You have no way to figure out what the rubber is.
So what they would probably be doing is they would be attacking it from three ways.
One would be the logical way.
One would just be doing an analysis testing.
Anything that they could figure out.
And there would probably be anthropological studies.
There would probably be painstakingly study every inch of that pillow to see if there was even more into the news.
And the other one would be a smaller option because you said they're logical.
But you would have to imagine that some kind of religion would spring up.
Maybe not like they have a god but a spiritualism at most.
That's interesting.
Actually it's a religion but it's not.
It's more of like not worshiping crystals but like under the idea.
They were worshiping the idea.
They were worshiping the potential for their civilization.
The guy I was walking on before you came over.
I was looking at it like this that they viewed the pillows as a source of strength.
Because they look at it's ingering this.
It's ability to just survive everything but still intact.
So they believe that the civilization, they believe that there was a civilization here but I got wiped out.
Well not necessarily that because they don't know if it's wiped out.
Because they felt no body, no signs of warfare.
It's having a pillow.
So they are scientific about it and they're logical about it but they're also spiritual about the meaning.
Yeah because they don't exactly know.
So you have to imagine in that gap as well religious ideas die.
That gap provides the beginning of humanity.
We originally thought disease was caused by bad spirits or bad tumors in the body.
But as we learn, we filled in those gaps with signs.
And as we thought it was signs, we looked to more and more gaps and put it there.
Yeah.
It's a positive idea here.
So imagine ancient humanity.
And they're in the jungle, they're in the brush.
And they hear noise in the bush.
It's better for them.
It's more beneficial to them biologically and survival speaking to think that movement in the bush sound.
It's a predator as opposed to believing it's the wind.
And then we've attributed that same principle to the weather, nature.
The lightning above isn't just natural process.
It's the gods.
No, I completely agree with that.
So do you know the old cook, Delfi?
They found out the cave that she would bring all these people into.
The gasses make you high.
You'll hallucinate actually.
So they found out that just people would go into these caves, get high off this gas.
And think that they were having a spiritual thing of this old cook guiding.
Which intensifies the nature.
That's crazy.
But they also found a cave that is similar to, I believe it's the Greek version of hell.
And it emits a poisonous gas that kills anything that goes in it.
And they think that's what the tale of hell came from.
Because you know, they're underwater.
You go down a deep, dark cave endlessly.
And that's how you get to the underwater.
For them, this cave may as it could have been the entrance because of course they're not going to figure out.
You know, if you're dying at the entrance.
Like it kills everything in the land.
Animals, everything that they will look to it dies.
So that's how you could hypothetically, you could expand that hypothesis.
You could like, there are more details.
We need to keep searching.
We need to keep exploring.
Yeah.
Well, because if the logical, it's going to go two ways with this opening.
Either the species is going to benefit us, or this is a possible weapon.
Because like you said, it went in the bush.
Okay, let's say the extreme people.
We're of course going to be a minor enemy.
I think the overall, the society is built to be a little more optimistic, a little more communal.
You know, we're not as distrusting as people.
So we understand the idea of the existence of the paranormal.
Yeah.
So the paranormal is still there, but it's not as prevalent as it is in our society.
You know, it's like instead of the majority of people being the flat out there,
is there actually the people that know the earth is round?
So they move past the basic care of those of them, you can say.
Yeah.
They move past that.
They're more...
They're more social.
Yeah, they're more social.
They're more communal than typical spaces.
And there's less, there's the lowest paranoia, less distrusting results.
Oh, trust you.
That reminds me of Shadeys.
Okay.
Did you see the full...
All four of these, yeah?
Oh, listen.
There's some of them.
Oh, there's some of them.
There's some of them listening to them.
Did you see this?
Is this the newest one?
These are the finals.
Well, the final eight of twelve.
So imagine balance and depression being in the center of the Dota Cater.
So we have pain and pleasure, aggression and fear,
elation and misery, desire and aversion.
And then these are all on...
These eight are on the sides of the twelve side of Dota Cater.
Yeah.
And they're adjacent to each other with respect to their biological traits.
So say, for example, aggression, right?
In animals, the adjacent to that would be anxiety or fear, right?
Yeah.
But aggression in humans is also a tribute to one.
Hanger.
Yeah.
That's all it is.
Hanger is an abstraction of aggression and fear is an abstraction of anxiety.
And these are built in features and things like dogs, you know, we have for cats.
They express both of these things, except humans are very bad at attributing.
We attribute, like, it appropriately, like, the dogs.
Yeah.
Or the dog is scared, right?
But we don't attribute those exactly to us.
It's more of an abstraction to us.
We don't think for ourselves as animals, but we are, in fact, just biological.
So, elation and misery.
That's that.
What do you think those are attributed to?
So elation, not being happiness.
More like, look, look, look, look, it's weird, but it's weird.
And then it's like, you have the, the smile being a, I am not aggressive.
Yeah, it's a social thing.
It's a social survival skill.
The laughing is weird, but that's what I redo.
Misery.
So, what's interesting here is that this attribute is actually attributed to, what do you think?
It's sickness.
Yeah.
Believe it or not.
Sickness?
Sickness.
Or, like, imagine, you are in a sick state.
What do you feel like?
You feel like the symptoms there are analogous to depression.
It's, elation and misery are, elation is, aha, I'm not aggressive.
And misery is the crying, for example.
You know, that, that is like, okay, I am extremely anxious.
Like, there is a situation that is bothering me and I can't do anything about it.
I need help, I need social help.
The crying.
It's loud, right?
It's annoying.
It's not just, but, right.
You good?
Anyway.
You get, you get, I'm going in for a bit.
Yeah.
All right.
So, and then desire and immersion.
What do you think is attributed to?
The want, the need for something, the, the, the, okay.
So, it's not like, it's also attributed to sexual desire, I don't imagine.
But, the innate need for that, what do you think it is?
It's like, you're reaching out, you're grasping out, you're trying to get something.
We don't have a word for that.
It's want, but it's not want.
It's also innate in age.
I mean, so it's both, it's need and want.
This is why I'm using symbols, because these words are not directly attributed to...
Yeah, it's well-known for more abstract look, because it was very instructive.
Yep.
You're right.
That's what I'm doing.
Okay.
So, aversion, that's that.
What do you think it is?
How much you guess here?
What's the opposite of it?
Aversion and desire.
So, imagine aversion being like, discussed.
I think it's not something I want.
Yeah.
But desire is something I want.
Probably.
Yeah.
You scratch your nose.
It's great then.
You know, it's like...
It's something close to the pain and pleasure.
Pain and pleasure.
Yeah.
But it's also a facial response thought, right?
It's aggression is discussed.
I'm sorry, aversion is discussed.
Well, that's not a thing I've explained.
So, pain and pleasure, you know.
And that can be expressed in the face to a subtle degree.
But aggression and fear, those are very obvious, right?
In relation to misery, those are also fairly obvious.
Desiring aversion.
Those are a little more abstract.
We don't really overthink.
Yeah, we don't overtly say it or express it in the face.
We say it, we speak it, we don't show it.
This could probably be the whole thing to show.
So, this is why I think depression might be attributed to misery,
but it's not quite there.
It's more of an internal thing, actually.
It's not like...
It's like...
There is no outward expression.
You're neutral.
You have your facial expressions, right?
Most of the time, you never actually see someone in the neutral expression.
The moment you make eye contact with someone, there are subtle movements.
Yeah.
In the expression expressions.
Okay, so yeah, look at the side.
The one that develops a formulated response.
That's it.
So, depression and what do you think balance would be in this context?
So, it's interesting.
I think that balance is contentiveness.
Yeah, it's like...
There's contentiveness itself, I think, is the idea would it be instead of being happy?
Being happy is exaggerated.
It emits morphings and stuff.
It's the more extreme.
You can't always be high on happiness.
I know.
You've got to be contentiveness is the way to go.
So, depression.
This is a real lack of...
Yeah, it's like the negative version of that.
There's the...
Anyway.
So, you take all these.
You take these eight.
There's a few more we have to talk about.
Still, the pride.
And...
Pride and shame, right?
Yeah.
And there's also...
We talked about this too.
Empathy.
And enmity.
And enmity.
And enmity.
How do you say that?
I don't know.
E-N.
And then, E-M.
Empathy and enmity.
So, these are a little abstract.
And you help work it through.
So empathy is the whole thing, dude.
It's whole to describe.
Because empathy is...
Very broad concept.
Think of it.
It was most both in sympathy.
You're either helping because it brings you some kind of internal pleasure.
You're helping because you feel a connection to that person.
Or you could even be helping because you feel like you could get something to benefit out of that.
Right.
But that expresses it socially.
That expresses the inward feeling, the expression we've had for that.
That empathy.
Empathy or empathy.
Think of it.
There's a facial expression for it.
Is there?
It's kind of like a smile.
I don't know.
Maybe.
I've never actually seen anyone be visually empathetic.
It's more...
I think it's more internal.
It's an internal thought process.
Well, like for me, before I hope so...
You're an animal.
Before you hope, there's always that moment of you thinking, like...
How am I able to do this?
What are the risks?
You always have that moment of pause.
Hmm.
So, that's the initial moment.
That's the initial moment.
Because we've got to analyze...
It's like the bystander effect, right?
Yeah.
You're at the initial moment of pause.
But I think in the extreme willingness to act...
So say, for example, my cat is hurt, right?
My extreme empathy.
I'm going to jump right in.
I'm going to help right away because I care about that cat.
You know?
Yeah, but still...
That's the extreme...
That's the extreme version of the second.
Your brain will pause.
Hmm.
You're an animal.
Nothing's really automatic for people.
Yeah?
I mean...
When I game their videos, it's a micro of a second.
Your brain takes a moment to formulate that thought of how...
Because everyone is still calculated analysis of risks, benefits, relationships, and memory.
Yeah, I think you'd have to remember that.
Because maybe that's why the bystander effect is like...
Maybe that's why the...
That...
Oh, dear, I'm pulled.
I probably grabbed a racquet.
I remember my mic, but...
Let's see.
Uh...
I don't...
Maybe I was supposed to keep cause I'm fucking skinny.
Oh, dear.
All right.
Well, he's wearing a blanket to give me a tube.
Yeah, that helped.
But...

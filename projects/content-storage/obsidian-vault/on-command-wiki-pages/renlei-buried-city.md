Renlei wanted it for themselves but the city was meant for all of humanity. In order to prevent it's misuse the city's creators sunk it below the surface but gave them impression that it was destroyed. Humans must begin anew. The creators have their mind in AI machines. (these machines take the form of normal humans)

00:00:08	welcome back everyone if you were sitting with us earlier we had a bad start so you're starting over actually brought up an old project that's gonna help a lot okay what are we talking about talking about input buffers what's that well if you've ever played basically any type of action game it helps make the game feel awesome you know we're jumping we can't jump in the air but when we land we can jump again right if there wasn't an input buffer I would have to wait until I landed or whenever that flag was set

00:00:51	where I can jump again in this case it's when I'm you know touching the ground again so if you listen on the mic it's a little bit before I land you know my buffer actually shortened it it was 15 frames before everybody changed it to ten well setting up for this video so anyway it's just that's basically how many frames you know it holds on to the buffer so what is a buffer right it's like some padding some extra and so that's what it does it collects our inputs and then holds onto them for a few more frames you know however more

00:01:34	that we want I have 10 in here show this old project here this will visualize it real nice so right here I hit a button you can see it traveling down it going up I'll go ahead and pause it so down here this is the first frame right here on this five five means neutral these are the directional inputs here's where I pressed a and this is where I released a so I tapped it held it for two frames and released it on fourth frame here this X here means it gets used up by the input buffer so that way as it holds on

00:02:23	because idea the buffers it's gonna every frame it's going to read through all these and find one for us so like in the case of the jump it's like we jump and then we jump again but we can't cancel right away so it's gonna check this whole buffer for when we pressed a right here and then jump again in this case you know throw a punch or whatever this gets used up so if we checked at every frame as soon as this canceled you know the animation stopped if it was still in the buffer as it travels up the

00:02:58	animation ends let's say then it would check this again and we don't want that so when we use it to actually cancel them something we use it up we may still want this data here so we have extra flags there so it doesn't get checked again go through their show again I'll DoubleTap quickly in attack go through Oh a thrown one so here and I've double tap the attack she threw her hook that happened down here you know we've gone through this many frames we have this other press here it's in the buffer you

00:03:37	know it's on screen here but nothing's happened yet I'm not pressing anything we're gonna step through wait for it wasn't gonna happen Lee right the end boom so it's like right before you hit about like one more frame that's a pretty long time there so that may not be something you want that maybe that's too big of a buffer and you know as your game gets more advanced you'll want longer times for certain input so your buffer might be pretty huge the only check for like quarter-circle forward inputs or double quarter-circle forward

00:04:22	inputs you know you'd give a little more leeway now I can guilty gear four four six six o Tzar back dashes and four dashes especially on wake up you only have a few frames like input those during certain times you know that sometimes the input buffer is like smaller on wakeup so you have to be more precise anyway that's that's working in design rather than like implementation so anyway here you know it took all that time for it to go through waited for the Kent the animation to end or whatever conditions you have for when you can

00:04:58	cancel again change your state happen here automatically because that double tap even though that happened like one two three you know 2015 at least frames earlier it happened again so it gives us a buffer that way you know we're doing combos we can just do like ABA or whatever I don't have to do it with like super strict timing strict timing can be good but so strict that everything's like just frame timing or you like drop combos or miss jumps that's not fun so anyway step through cancels again she starts

00:05:41	her hook let me go through there so again if you're watching earlier um I was flattering a bunch so I'm glad that I remembered that I had that so let's actually look at the implementation in some frameworks like my first game aces wild well I was in my first first but first when I released commercially use the XNA framework it held all of the likes built-in input stuff in like these struts that you could it's like I don't know I can't think of the word hold in variables folders all right word in

00:06:35	unity you can't as far as I know so how you get your inputs generally let me college boy get my input you do input dot get access I do rock cuz I don't like all their bills and stuff I mean you can change it but it's like what you doing I want it this way then you do like you know in my case it's weapon one and so what does that do it returns a float right so just checks on this frame you know the state of this axis and even though it's an axis that's actually a button that's another weird thing with unity if you

00:07:17	want buttons you could do get button raw it'll return it as a bull instead I just like to get get access raw so it's a little more raw data it's gonna depend on what you want so the thing I'm getting at is a in other things that I'm used to you can just do input my input and that would be like the whole struct right as far as I know I don't know how you can hold that so why would we want that well if we want an array right so that would be like sixteen input or 16 frames of all the possible inputs it

00:07:59	would be pretty huge and maybe too much for what you might need but it's fast and easy so unfortunately again as far as I know we're gonna have to do a little bit of extra setup but that's okay it's not too bad so how I do it I have we see where to start it's kind of weird is kind of like all these ink we can kind of start anywhere I guess so here is that same concept right that I just did it's under this void called resolve command I do input dot get button and it's just this input buffer item you know it's my own class that has

00:08:46	just its own string called button you know that's the button it's looking for I set it up here where I have a you know static just a big global Universal array of what my general inputs are so I have weapon one weapon to check - dodge jump you know start select all these things then it when it's initializing it looks all those up creates like a basic frame which is all of those inputs you see here I'm getting a little to come like abstract so the same foot buffer item is basically just that button right and

00:09:29	then it has an actual buffer in there which is the size of whatever size you want so I wish I had a way to visualize this better what's going here so we throw that right I don't know this is the best way to look at it shoot sorry again I don't want to get stuck up here all right let's start the beginning right so in unity if you're not familiar you go to edit project settings input so this is your input manager these names right here are a string that you set and you set it right here again mines weapon

00:10:10	just like in here where did it go so these are all the ones that I want to set up you know it's collecting other data it has a bunch of other stuff in here but for this buffer all I want are these you'll notice there's no directional input and we'll get to that so we check all these and I make it's not exactly 2d array but it basically is it's an array of all these right this is my just like my base array this is just sort of the constructor the actual item are these it just has a buffer you know a window and

00:10:52	then a buffer of input command items and you know there's ten of those or however big you want your buffer to be what's inside here this class is just an integer and a used pool so the integer is just a hold value if we go here it doesn't visualize very well but basically I increment it up for each frame that I've held it and so if this was visualized you know would be one two three four five six seven and the negative one when I release it I do a negative one just an easy way to check that if you want negative edge in your

00:11:33	game which is it'll do another press check when you release a button guilty gear has stopped using that but I think Dragon Ball fighters still uses it it actually checks for 3 frames afterward I've heard again it's gonna depend on your game if that works for you or not if that's like too much if you've ever played dark souls and that games weird I mean right it satorious ly hard or whatever some of the timing on there stuff's really strict it's like a really small window it's ok you panic you know

00:12:06	there's no attack coming in and you start mashing dodge right start mashing roll your character roles you dodged detect great I'm ready to counter-attack oh no I've rolled again because you're mashing and all your Dodge inputs were still in the buffer when the Dodge finished you know that roll came out again and even though you only wanted the one there's ways to get around that Ray of priorities for certain things again we'll cover that in more video maybe not again maybe talked about that because we had a rough start we're

00:12:35	starting over but you will or we will do more videos with more specific implementation we're gonna focus mostly on just the buffer part here so just strung a little bit on how to link explain this maybe just like a drawing would be better let's actually do a screen shot okay yes this will be good so we have this is our basic buffer right inside each one of these is a buffer of you know this hold and use just real simple stuff and I think this part isn't necessary I just feel like it is and so basically what we have you know is this

00:13:41	you know if we had a two frame buffer it'd be like this three frame or frame by frame six three you get the idea so it's a lot it's a lot of stuff what's happening and so when we check we check for each button input and depending on the game like if you have corsica ford inputs like and this actually do they don't show up over here but if you'll check here when I do a course will go forward input you know held that and this is what buffer frame it's on ten nine eight seven so it's holding on that

00:14:09	core so go forward for those frames do course is go back drag a pledge look sorry I'm holding the joystick weird something's jumping around but again that's like more complex implementations so it's holding out all those when we actually check to like actually cancel into something right I'm just gonna depend on like your moves that stuff again you know this is gonna be real basic just the buffer part you know we check here see if we can cancel or not we update the buffer what we do is sorry if I'm jumping around a bit still

00:14:54	I'm a little I thought this would be straightforward we record it's happening right here so for each input buffer item in our input buffer do see that resolve command that checks so see is the input buffer item see resolve command if the buttons being used you know we use the space input stuff here's a little bit of a hack because immunity left on the Xbox 360 controller left trigger and right trigger on the same axis lens just negative ones just positive so I've to have a little bit of a hack in here not

00:15:40	a huge deal but it's not very elegant kind of bugs me input buffer count negative one so this is our index it doesn't matter here I start at the end right count minus one is the very end of the buffer and I update it if it's being pressed so in here you'll see you do the same thing and hit the button we update down here and as we actually update the buffer resolve our most recent one again a recent one is at the bottom here we push them all up so what happens is that we go through the whole buffer you know

00:16:32	for each buffer you know we're doing a for loop here it's hold is equal to the one in front of it ahead of it are you know higher up in index and so maybe a better way to visualize it if we count it down and then did - but basically each frame we make it the one before and then the last one just gets set to you know our new input so then all these just check the ones ahead of it so the next frame you know this guy's right here this five is gonna check this one so we update the next frame and it just

00:17:19	turns into who it was like the one before it you know what I mean it looks like they're all just moving through but really they're all changing to the one before it until it runs out eventually so that's like the main gist that's like the meat of what an input buffer is it holds on to them for how many frames you know each older frame makes itself or each newer frame makes it look like the one older before it and in this visualization you know we only see that one button but if I hit like every oh I

00:17:58	don't how about my input set sorry when I brought it into this new unity project at reset all my values over here but really it's holding on to all this stuff on each one of those frames I'm just visualizing the ones that you know are actually being pressed you know like am view are being pressed there so there's a lot going on you can get a little confusing but it's not too bad so we step through there and we resolve this command right if that button is being pressed we do hold up if you don't know

00:18:32	what I'm doing I'm doing double click on a method and hitting f12 and it'll take you to the implementation of that it's really handy pull this lesson zero this is actually a little bug I fix just now because when I release hold I set it to negative one as a way to you know flag that it was released if you wanted you could have you know something like that and then you wouldn't have to do it with the negative one stuff but I preferred this well I don't prefer it but just what I had so fold is greater than zero

00:19:10	whoops looking at the wrong and pull this less than zero hold equals one this is just in case if through incredible dexterity I released and press it again on the next frame that I would actually get one and not zero because if we're holding the button hold plus equals one right and you'll notice we're not doing anything like yeah let's put excess raw or hold on get button up or get button down because we're we know that it always resets to zero and so if I equals one that that means we pressed it so

00:19:53	that means it's this frame here the press frame that's not a given example it's the press frame right here right because right here it was 0 here it equals 1 I have a little visual indicator of the V present you know like pressing down and then a this is the frame was no longer holding it so it's set to negative 1 so if a button is being pressed then we do hold up otherwise if it's not being pressed you know it's real strict like nothing else going on then we for sure do release hold if it's greater than 0 if it was

00:20:29	being pressed then we said it's a negative 1 we also do used equals false means we can use it again then hold equals 0 so we're updating our input buffer and then we actually update our move list again I'm not gonna get into too much of like how to implement this in this video but we'll get to it because you have to kind of understand state machines and things like that so it's real complicated just as there's just so many more special cases that start to happen but I'll get to the stuff that we

00:21:15	that will just explain like how this is working so I have all these like special cases like well there's there's some that are important so we go through our move list and I'll show you a move list real quick so this is my move list again this is gonna be a little more specific implementation some games need very little stuff with our state machines this game is very complex you have these big move sets that you can customize so it's like a really complicated thing that's why it's a little rough I'm

00:21:53	showing you how to do it put some never player ever move lists so these are like the possible actions they're just indexes you know going to like a global global action list and here's the actual commands that are required so here it's a simple one like press B and so it happens so we'll show that one we have jump if we can jump you know for it grounded or not press D to do another more complicated one hold our B press a is another one so how mine works is that it goes through my move list whoops

00:22:42	checks and this is where it gets crazy because you for every single move every single input you check the buffer and the whole buffer is this whole huge array that we have it seems slow but it's it's pretty fast and there's little ways that are that optimize it you know we stop as soon as we find one you can kind of check along the way too but if you have like a priority system you kind of have to check everything anyway so if we have something like press a or coarser afford a or hold R and press a we're probably

00:23:23	gonna wanna like prioritize one and so you kind of have to go through the whole buffer see which one had the most priority and then actually execute that one at the end so anyway go through our home Lube list so move lists I inputs here or current Lube list slot so I call them you know we checked that priority or not if it's less than then we don't care we won't check it see if we can cancel certain moves have special cancel states like being able to jump or not in this game there's some you know sort of more

00:24:01	spectacular moves or you can cancel your hits done you know like ninja style like returning the smoke and drop a log or whatever and you know do cool stuff like that or other just special cases where if you get parried you can't cancel into everything we can cancel on other stuff so again it's really a game specific but um just showing you how complicated and get but how important it is this really helps with game feel and just having good game good games going through the move let's go through each slide ok we

00:24:33	can cancel or the right priority we hit that move list and then we go through each input and so that is you know right here hold our B so it's our first input and it's a special like hold this is just something I set up myself you'll have to again this is it's a real specific implementation I probably won't even recommend this one it's uh I really wanted like a universal sort of implementation but it's just they change so much Lee even though aces wild instilled a little deeper really similar like this is a lot different than what I

00:25:07	did in my previous alone so sorry about that I wish it could be maybe as we go along you know again this will be a multi-part video I believe and we'll hopefully improve that maybe find like a modular you know just big code snippet I could share that y'all could use so we hit that move list slot you know we're checking you know this command like fireball or just basic jab or you know if you jump whatever it is and then we check the inputs for a hold input we don't have to check the first buffer or the whole buffer we just check

00:25:55	the first frame of that buffer because we want to know if we're holding it right now not if we held it in the past certain moves you may want that you may want it where two buttons are being pressed at the same time which is a little bit different than like hold target and hit a button you know what I mean you may want something really at the same time which is a whole nother can of worms because you have to do carat canceling or everything has to be just frame it's nonsense but in this case I just want to make sure we're

00:26:28	holding it right now or on that frame rather I guess it is on that frame no cuz it's obvious like the current one interesting I'd have to do some testing it works so don't think about it too much but basically we just check if hold is greater than zero on the current frame you know input buffer count minus one which is this one right here our very first one so if we're holding our or whatever then that checks out and so we'll move on to the next input if it fails then we break out and we stop checking this input that command was not

00:27:03	met so you just bounce to go the next one if it is we go true then we go to the next input input command which is you know not input prices that we've done but what that move requires to be executed you know in this case hold RB whoops and press a button impress me whatever so then we check again in the buffer now we'll actually hit the buffer so for these certain special ones you don't have to check the input buffer just check it for jumping check if we're holding a button here actually hit that

00:27:45	buffer so for each input buffer we do you know that buffer item B can execute so we go to it it's pretty simple if hold equals one that means we actually pressed it that we hadn't been holding it you know if it's greater than one then we've been holding it you may want that if you want like a game where you hold down a button you keep shooting things like that or if it's zero means we have a precedent or if it's negative one if you want a negative edge you would do this let's see if it works I'm curious should I haven't tested this

00:28:32	curious so I tap a or whatever oh it's not working at all now what happened oh whoops or I love the song so sweet again I can't remember actually that bad start it's the Street Fighter 3 new Jan original arranged album well you know in our favorite characters first age free makes it so sick all right press it I'm pressing it and I'm holding it you can see I have like a hold command where like it gets really weird so anyway I'm gonna release it and she swings some people have that like instead of negative one well no they

00:29:36	still have that but they just don't have other basic commands they have it on like just fireball commands and things like that anyway just something to think about oops so can execute hold equals and has it been used so as we go through you know this checks out I have some weird you know I hold on to those variables instead of just doing like strict if statements because I need to check them again down here for reasons input complete equals true that just means like it's like a real command it means

00:30:18	like I actually pressed a button I don't check this for like holes and special conditions um it makes sense like it's just really hard to explain it I hold on the button meaning it just like gives me a really Universal way to have like chargeable or holdable attacks so I can just hold on till it's like global variable latest button same thing here's a little interaction check so it's like different from our normal move list if I want to open a door or something it's set to my jump button so I mash and jump

00:31:03	here click over to this gate and press jump I don't actually jump the gate open something these guys punch the [ __ ] out of me same thing with these doors oh no it didn't work those doors open what happens is it eats my input which I want it to do you know used equals true so again one of the conditions for this being able to execute is that hold it hasn't been used yet so we set it to true so it can't work and then I set some context stuff and I break out at the loop so I stopped checking context shut stuff is

00:31:39	actually do like in-game interactions rather than like my move list interactions but go through all that and you know it still doesn't pass then I just break out of the whole thing but if we pass all those things then we hold onto that slot in our move list and we check that slot and check its priority and we set that and we go on to the next one so that way when you come back up here we check to see if that priority it's less than or equal is that a mistake oh no less then the next one coming up

00:32:28	right anyway it's set the right way just a little bit confusing way to do it so we passed all the tests we got the one with the minus priority then we go through and we do current button dot used again that's just so we don't check it again I have some special cases for you know I'm starting a new thing this advanced step thing is real specific in this game so you wouldn't necessarily want to do that and then current action equals Curt move list you know set to that action in that moves the list slot

00:33:04	hold RB and press B is to check my move list whoops SB first draw this move looking pretty sick well so let's feel like we've come to a sudden stop I don't know we'll do a review here hopefully get everything straight it's kind of complicated and it's kind of weird and again this implementation here will be specified in a later video need a drink one sec so from the top first thing you need to do is set your inputs you're inside a unity project settings input these names here are strings that you specify yourself

00:34:03	there's preset ones I'll probably actually redo some of these it's that the nature of the game has changed it checks another string here that's based on like some joystick stuff again this is outside of the scope of this video but this is just sort of how you start set up all these you know maybe it's just a tack and jump and so whatever buttons you want to check that you want you in a buffer you set up this basic frame here which is a list or array it doesn't matter I'm just saying you can actually use either one of all

00:34:42	those items so this is just sort of our base like interface for checking against unities built in one because our actual input buffers over here so we have an input buffer item which is a string which it gets from this and so when you construct that we go through here but we make one for each one of these we make an input buffer item or excuse me an input command item no no sorry the name is confusing an input buffer item for each one of those so right here we have our input buffer for each one of those in here we make a new

00:35:47	one so we're making one livin 12 we set it to this name you know we make it assign it to that button so we add it's built into the constructor gosh darn it and so when we make a new one of those we take that string which it pulls from here set its button variable string to this you know whatever we go through each one first ones called weapon or some weapon to make a new buffer which is actually all that whole thing's release nonsense and that's the actual buffer so we make in each one of these we make as many as

00:36:48	we specify these on another array or list you know we do ten in this case and that's your input buffer size so let's set it to 60 so you can see you have an idea of how it could be bad we showed that in the beginning of the video but it's just gonna hold on to our inputs for a whole second which is kind of crazy so I'm like if you listen so hold on to that second one for like ever you can get get really lost like a hit stop press and stuff for a long time and then keeps it going you're gonna go a little

00:37:31	bit higher 15 was what I was working on for a long time 10 seemed a little small for some stuff so that's the buffer right we have that set up we go through there just make a bunch of these you know each one of those is basically an array of itself I mean it's not necessarily itself you could do that if you wanted I just find it easier to set it up with like an extra class in here or just have a hold and used you could have all this one and all this in one class if you wanted just have all this side of this same class

00:38:08	here would just be a little bit redundant with this part so it's up to you you have to update your input so this happens every frame we have to date the input buffer forgot to talk about this update left stick I don't need a buffer for this stuff I don't do any directional input stuff for like special commands it's just for moving around so I only need to know what the current state of the stick is I still hold it into my own little variables here it's a lipstick X lipstick way you put get access raw actually in a previous video

00:38:47	where we did third-person camera controls for 3d games we talked we cover this so I still throw back there the left stick and then we actually update the input buffer so go through each input buffer item so that's not the actual buffer yet that's each one of these so go through this one check it soul buffer you know all ten or twelve I think we set it to thirteen now and I'll go through all 13 of these all 13 of these all 13 of these all 13 of these and so on resolve command you know just checks if pressing it or not this first

00:39:41	step rection not going through all of it yet I get ahead of myself the first step we just checked this command here and again we checked the one at the end and then we move them up can go any direction you want it's just important that you're checking from the right end you know in order you want to check the oldest one basically first now again in this visualization you know we roll it up like this but we check I don't want to make sure yeah that's right sorry someone's knocking hello it's all them I was recording but that's

00:40:47	alright so go through the input buffer the last input buffer item is set to our current state so we check that button you know that button was set in the beginning we do input that get button this is very specific to unity how this implementation here again there's a little bit of a hack to get around that stuff here do hold up if it's being pressed we increment it up one if it's at negative one or zero we just set it to 1 and then any higher we go up again one is an actual press because the previous frame was zero then we go

00:41:29	through that whole buffer again like I said you know 13 of these 13 of these well 12 you know minus 1 and for each one you do the hold and they used equal to the 1 you know before it right here so this one's gonna turn into a press then this one's gonna turn into press the next frame and these ones are gonna you know give it up as we go through so that's the buffer it's updating fine and then you have to set that against your actual you know in my update input you do to update the input buffer then we

00:42:14	actually update the move list you can see here the sexually returns a bool that whole big mess and if that happens then that new action actually you do a start action thing or just a whole thing that you'd have to implement yourself I love this songs from your favorite song in the album we go through most important thing here fresh input buffer item in there B can't execute you know if it's one so the basic implementation wouldn't be all this muscle stuff you just go through each and put buffer item after

00:42:57	updating it if it can execute that means hold equals one shouldn't suppress it and it hasn't been used yet and if that executes it's okay you might have to do some other checks to make sure you're actually executing into the next action we do current button not used this is just a way for me to check again because I go through the whole input buffer for like the whole move list so I have to hold on to that button current button and then if that actually executes then we'll set it to used so that way we

00:43:36	don't check it again and then we'll actually execute I believe that'll do it again I mean I have like some good code up right away there's not much to it you could basically get it from here the simple concept you know the base concept is fairly simple the main thing is just knowing to check the right direction you know again I we update the last one and then move them up and then we check from top to bottom so it can seem a little slow because we're doing all these like extra checks but it's important for the

00:44:28	buffer to work its again we swing we press the button twice player two moving now whatever oh maybe I jumped over you know we hit the button starts at the bottom it moves up and we check from the top that that parts a little bit weird so just important to remember that if you like check from the bottom that it's not gonna be working quite right but yeah that about does it again we will do some more specific implementations on like actual state machines and things like that bring that all together just understanding an input

00:45:18	buffer is important if you just wanted like a real simple one again you probably have code like this in your game already if input dot get button you know do attack or do jump so instead set that to a buffer update it as such you know set it to the last spot update all previous ones to the frame before it so they whoops do that all the time no let's not live it anymore you know so as they move up and then remember a check from top to bottom you know check its oldest to newest even though it's like

00:46:09	there on top it's weird instead of just doing this right here just do that extra step and then again that one of the big things is to have that used bool here when you let go use equals false and when you press it it doesn't equal used but if we actually execute cancel into a new command then we use it up so that way doesn't get used again yeah you have any questions let me know I'll have a little bit of code there mainly this one here probably have it like in one class hopefully it'll be a little bit easier

00:46:50	and try to make it a little bit more Universal for unity and just anything that you might want it for or you're not gonna want it for everything even an action game with lots of moves and weird cancels and stuff you don't necessarily want the buffer for everything in my case I do a lot of my influence comes from fighting games so it's kind of like this strict state I don't know it's hard to explain yeah that does it siren kind of jumping back and forth thank you all for the support lately it's like I know it's me start to sound

00:47:25	redundant there like a platitude or something but it's not I really mean it um feedback has been really fun please let me know if there's any topics you'd like covered it's really hoping to get some animation stuff but I've been working on assets too much it really got to be level design and I want a double dip a bit so um I want to have a new character a new anime setup and we'll do some more like animation I have some old animation videos what I want it more in this lake structure where a little bit

00:47:58	better focusing on getting information to people so they're like more compact and more about the knowledge than just like going through it or whatever but yeah thank you all for the support please let me know if you have any questions this video will be available at patreon.com forward slash culture attack which is my patreon where all our videos are again all relevant assets will be made available as well as our free big value of culture tech studio is free and open information techniques and knowledge information and knowledge is

00:48:39	that redundant anyway our assets are also available but those are for educational use only so please don't let any of that stuff show for your game but I do want it there for y'all to see if you want to look I know when I was getting into 3d I asked a lot of people if I get to see their 3d models and they were really worried about it um I mean I can understand it but um you know I had no intention of just like using you stuff because if I really want to do stuff like it's just you know there's ways to to

00:49:14	get it anyway um anyway I got a little negative there at the end want to keep it positive um thank y'all so much this videos been fun it's they have a lot to action games are really important they don't have to be that complex again you can just have like a simple input here um that you check with a used or not and so basically would just be a string and then a used value just have a big ole array of that for however many commands you want mine is just a little more structured because there's so many

00:49:55	commands and possibilities and stuff so yeah that was a long goodbye but I'm really thankful for y'all um just getting funnier and funnier please let me know I don't always know what people want covered on the previous video like last week's video I would like to do a step by step I kind of wanted an overview but then like after I sat with it I felt a little weird that I just sort of glossed over a bunch of like different effects so we'll make me do step by step I don't know it seems like I covered I don't know but uh I'll catch

00:50:29	y'all later thanks so much

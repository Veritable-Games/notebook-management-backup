 set of risks that he did. And to expect the
different outcome, to expect that the next one will not behave like all of the others did, strikes me
as strange. Whatever you do to the people in charge now, if you don't change the system,
replacing them with other people will not solve the problem it never has.

An interesting interview is right around the corner.
Welcome back friends to the second half of economic update for this show. I'm very happy to
welcome to the microphones here. Juliana Forlano. Some of you will remember that she's been on the
program before. But I want to briefly introduce her once again. She is now the host of
waking up with Juliana. It's a program on WBAI 99.5 FM in New York City. Every weekday morning at
7 o'clock, there she is, bringing people on with telephone calls, bringing guests on. It's a
remarkable program. And I recommend it to you if you're in the greater New York area.
She's also a senior correspondent for ACT TV covering protests and political activism for that
station. Juliana also writes and performs live and multimedia, political and socially conscious
comedy. You can follow her on Twitter at Juliana Forlano. That's with two ends, all one word.
Welcome to the program. Thanks so much for having me on.
Well, as I've told you and as I want my audience to know,
I am really interested in exploring not just a big formal questions of economics,
but all the things that make an economy work, more not work, that people don't talk about
although they should. And the one I want you to talk about are the problems that beset working
mothers. Our society, more and more, demands that mothers work, that they don't stay in the home,
that they add a whole set of responsibilities outside the home, usually adding them to the already
long list of responsibilities inside all the more of their children. And the tensions and problems
of that shape their lives, shape the economy. And that has to be talked about more than anything.
So I want to open it up by asking you, what are the problems of what in Europe is called work life
balance? How do you balance the competing demands on you? Well, first of all, thank you very much
for having me on the show. And I hope I can do justice to the working mom's plight these days.
And thanks for even bringing this topic up as something that's important to talk about. I don't
hear about it enough. And every time I do hear about it, it helps. It helps to have this conversation
because it's so secretive. And then moms, we feel guilty about everything. It just comes along.
It's like suddenly you give birth and also guilt comes out. And we're always wondering, am I doing
something wrong? Is this okay with my child? Am I doing the best I can? Is this, you know,
so there's always that guilt? And I think it's really important to recognize what pressures the
system is putting on. And, you know, where if we're falling short as a parent or if we're not
how much of that is on my plate or how much of that is, you know, contingent upon society. And
when you were doing the introduction question, you reminded me of just my parents work life balance.
My mother and father both worked because they needed to do that in order to support the family.
And my father had a heart attack early and then was unable to work. So my mother was supporting
our family from the time I was maybe 12 years old until he died in the rest of the time. So
working as a woman has always been something that's been on my agenda. Something you saw in
your mother every day. Exactly. And I saw, oh, you can be a mom and you can be a worker, but it wasn't
until I had my own children that I could see that the stresses that she was under how they
flowed back onto me. And now I'm a working mom and those same stresses flow onto my children.
And it's really hard to see that. You know, in our society, it's still the case, right, that
somehow without it ever being said, the woman has the major responsibility for the child or the
children, which means that even if you're both husband and wife or partners are both working outside
and maybe let's say equivalently, it's not equivalent when you come home. So that,
you know, the extra work that the female of the species is asked to do puts all kind, I would
assume puts all kinds of strains. You hear women talking about the anxiety they feel relative to
the child, if they're busy working. And you hear that a lot more in my experience than you hear
a man doing it. I kind of wanted to pull out from you some sense of your feelings about whether
men and women are managing these conflict. No, it's absolutely different. I mean, I can't speak
for every group. Obviously, there's going to be, but I think that women have the emotional burden
of being that emotional connection in that special way that is a mother to the child.
And that burden continues around the clock. You don't go to work and leave it at home.
It's with you all the time. And it's not a burden. I mean, that's a terrible. We're like,
oh, it's killing me. But, you know, it's, it's, it's there. And it changes you as a human being.
Um, your baby, your baby is how old she's two and a half. She's in what the Norwegians,
I think, called the testing phase. They call it the terrible twos here, but the boundary pushing
phase. But, you know, my husband is very helpful around the house. He doesn't have sort of an old
time idea of division of labor. He cooks. He cleans. He does the cat box. I mean, God bless him.
And so, but still there's this division of labor that he cannot do because he's the father
and I'm the mother. So that labor is always with me. I don't know if that makes sense, but
I've always felt that way. Also, just the, you know, it's not like he's going to breastfeed.
He would, my husband, if he could have, but he couldn't do that. So there's this connection there
that's just something that's innate to it. And you don't get to leave it at home. And
how does it, can you tell us a little more how it affects you? I mean, yeah,
that you, that you take it with you to your job, impacts your work life. How?
That's sort of wondering, I don't want to do a disservice to women who are mothers in the work
place. I think it actually expands us as people. And I think to create the opportunity for further
compassion, you know, could make a workforce actually far more wonderful than it doesn't necessarily
have to be a drag. But when I walk out of the door, I feel bad. I feel bad. And I'm lucky because I
have two part time work jobs that allow me to be home to full days out of the week and then on
the weekend. And it's not always like that because as it turns out, activists tend to protest on
the weekend. So I often get a lot of weekend work because that's what I cover my other job.
But you know, a lot of my friends had to make a choice, either lose half of the family's income
or not see their kid for 40 to 60 hours a week and basically have someone else, a whole
another economy of nannies, of daycares, whatever the case may be, raising their children. This is
another problem that comes down to economics. I moved out of Syracuse, New York because the job
economy in Syracuse, New York is pretty abysmal, especially for journalists. I think there's like
three up there. And that's it. And so moving to another place, now I'm far away from my family.
Don't see them as often. There's no there's no one to call for help, basically, that you don't pay
who's not just a hopefully a friendly neighbor or something like that. But it's not the same. And
that is driven by economics. I mean, you know, that whole upstate New York area was just destroyed by
NAFTA. And I think that really affects the children too. They don't have access to their grandparents
as if they were another parent or an aunt, as if it was an additional person. I lived around the
corner or elsewhere in the building or something. I do have some family members in Queens and we go
there quite a bit. And, you know, in Brooklyn people, there is still the opportunity in some
ethnic enclaves to all live on the same street or have a multi-family home or something where
you can do that. But it's really rare and far between. And there's an emotional toll on me
because I was brought up with Grant Nauna, 10 minutes down the street, grandma, half an hour away,
uncle's aunt's cousins all around, not right in the house. We didn't live. We lived in
like the suburbs, but not far away. And here we don't have that. And that that increases attention
level for a mother because I think mothers want to know that their kids are going to be safe and
protected and enveloped in love beyond what the mother can give. And, you know,
you said something interesting to me before we went on the cameras and on the radio part of the
program about part-time work. This society leaves that up to companies to decide whether it's
profitable or not. But if I hear you correctly, there ought to be a consideration about part and
full-time to accommodate the conditions of working mothers to create opportunities and flexibilities
that would make your life much easier. Absolutely. I write up until last week, I had three
part-time jobs and I had to make a choice. Go insane with three part-time jobs and then,
you know, when you're exhausted, you can't be a good mom. The kid picks up the stress or, you know,
choose to let go of a significant amount of income in order to be present and be physically able
to be present. You know, sleep deprivation comes with the job of motherhood. And then you got to
go to work and perform, you know, it's a stress and making that choice. You know, you just don't
know what's right. What did you do with your three jobs? One, I was an adjunct professor teaching
media studies. I am the host of WBAI Show and I cover, this is the hardest one because I cover
activist action, which isn't a regular job. It's like when it pops up, you run for it and because
it's irregular. You don't know how much money you're going to make in a month. This month could
be a lot. This month could be very little. And so economic instability and insecurity is part
in parcel of that. I have the other job that kind of brings in the baseline check, but economic
insecurity, cause I mean, how good of a mother can you be when you're terrified that you can't
feed the kids or bring in the diapers or even even if you're a middle-class mom, they're still
economic insecurity because the minute the kid is born, you're saving for Harvard or SUNY or
whatever college you're going to try. You want them the best for them and people in my situation,
I still carry a debt burden that is almost six figures from my own university education. And
you're really worrying about the next generation. Exactly. Free college education would bring that
stress level down. Free healthcare would bring that stress level down, not having to worry about,
I mean, part-time jobs don't usually give healthcare. I work for a liberal, you know,
news organization in Europe. In Europe. In Europe, it's a standard thing. You give everybody
healthcare. It doesn't matter whether they have a job, don't have a job, whether they have a
part-time job before. You separate the healthcare as a human need from the conditions of the
economy bouncing up and down. And that strikes everybody there as the normal natural humane thing
to do. Americans find it an amazing thing. It's a very strange thing we live under here where you
have to earn your right to be cared for. It's an economy that makes things work for profit.
It's the profit-making employer who decides part-time or full-time. The idea that you order a
range work-times to accommodate something as fundamental as bringing the next generation
into the world doesn't seem to compete. Appropriations, if they're not going to get your own
kid to work for that corporation, what do they care about? They don't care about your kid.
I'm sorry, I don't see that very much. Because we're running out of time, I wanted to make sure,
because it goes so fast. It goes fast. Give us a sense of your wishes,
your fantasy. Let your mind go. What would you like to think of a better economic system
would be able to offer women, particularly mothers, particularly mothers who work?
As I said before, the free education and equality education, a supported public education,
the mothers I know in New York City are scrambling to figure out how to educate their children
because the public schools have been undermined. So that's a whole nother issue, but equality,
free education, and free college education and free health care. But also, how about paid
maternity leave for more than six weeks? How about like six weeks? Six weeks, you barely
like, you know, we're walking around in six weeks. We've done programs on the, we're the only advanced
industrial country in the United States that gives no guaranteed legally required paid maternal
and paternal leave. It's unbelievable. There are countries out there much less rich than we,
who give a year, who give six months, who give it to both parents, et cetera, et cetera. It's an
extraordinary willingness of the American people to forego something which obviously families
of working mothers need, but everybody needs it. The child needs to be with the parents,
especially in those very young times. It's just, it's inhumane and I think it puts a specific burden
on the mother that you should be emotionally and physically ready to go back to work in, you know,
as much as six weeks or, or some people have a couple of months, that's not enough either.
And there's an enormous emotional toll. I took the first time I dropped my daughter off with a
different caregiver. I started crying and I took a YouTube, I took a video, not you, I didn't post
it because, but I took a video of it because it just struck me as, this is what all moms do. The
first time you have to drop off your child away from you is incredibly difficult and it becomes
less difficult, but it's still, it's still hard every day. And that emotional toll is going to spill
over onto your work. I'm sorry, we're not like compartmentalized as human beings or human beings
and that the treatment of workers in all sectors as cogs and not human, it's not very productive.
First of all, it's counterproductive to getting the work done that you want done.
And it really is the old question that we deal with on this program all the time.
Is the economy there to serve what people need or are people there to serve what the employer needs?
I mean, sooner or later you have to make that choice. And I think you've been very eloquent
about making clear the costs of not organizing the economy around the needs of working mothers
as a basic part of our population. I know we're out of time, but the mental health care
and the mental stress of it and the emotional part, it needs to be considered.
Thank you very much, Julian. Thank you so much. And thank you all for watching. I want to remind you
all, please support us by signing up on YouTube to follow us and looking at our websites and remembering

In America, it’s expensive just to be alive.
0:09
And that's not just because of the pandemic.
0:12
It's because of choices made by some of these
0:15
um....irregular Americans.
0:18
Just look at how big oil is raking it in
0:20
while you pay through the nose at the pump.
0:23
Not sure about you, but I'll do just about anything
0:26
to save fuel where I can.
0:28
Go around!
0:29
I'm driving slow because I'm saving gas.
0:34
You don't like it, go around. Go around!
0:36
That's on top of the average price of a new non-luxury car,
0:40
which is now over $44,000.
0:42
I mean, even accounting for inflation,
0:44
this is way higher than the average cost
0:46
when I bought my first car.
0:49
It's probably in a museum by now.
0:53
Even worse, the median price for a house is now over $440,000.
0:59
Compare that to 1972, when it was under $200,000.
1:03
Work a full time minimum wage job?
1:06
You won't even be able to afford rent
1:08
on a one-bedroom apartment
1:10
just about anywhere in the United States.
Whats left of a paycheck
1:18
And when you get back after a long day of work,
1:20
you'll likely be met with bills up the wazoo
1:22
for doctor's visits,
1:25
student loans, and utilities.
1:28
So what's left of the paycheck after basic living expenses?
1:32
And maybe not even those!
1:34
You can only reduce spending on food,
1:36
housing, and other basic necessities so much.
1:39
Want to try covering
1:40
the rest of your monthly costs with a credit card?
1:42
Well, now that's more expensive, too
1:44
with the Fed continuing to hike interest rates.
1:47
All of this comes back to how we measure
1:49
a successful economy.
A good economy
1:54
What good are more jobs
1:55
if those jobs barely pay enough to live on?
1:58
And what good are lots of jobs if they cause so much stress
2:01
and take up so much time that our lives are miserable?
2:04
And don't tell me a good economy
2:06
is measured by a roaring stock market
2:08
if the richest 10% of Americans own
2:10
more than 80% of it.
2:13
And what good is a large
2:14
gross domestic product
2:16
if more and more of the total economy is going
2:18
to the richest 1%?
Corporate profits
2:25
In fact, what good is economic growth
2:27
if the way we grow depends on fossil fuels
2:30
that cause a climate crisis?
2:34
These standard measures
2:36
— jobs, the stock market, the GDP —
2:39
They don't show how our economy is really doing,
2:43
who is doing well, or the quality of our lives.
2:48
People who sit at their kitchen tables at night
2:50
wondering how they're going to pay the bills,
2:52
they don't say to themselves,
2:53
“Well, at least corporate profits are at record levels.”
2:59
In fact, corporations have record profits
3:02
and CEOs are paid so much because
3:10
Over the past 40 years,
3:12
productivity has grown nearly four times as fast
3:14
as hourly pay.
3:16
That's right.
3:17
Working Americans are getting paid less
3:19
for being more productive than ever.
3:21
Wish we could say the same about billionaires.
3:24
At the same time, corporations are driving up
3:27
the costs of everyday items people need.
3:29
Because corporations are monopolizing their markets,
3:32
they don't have to worry about competitors.
3:35
A few giant corporations can easily
3:37
coordinate price hikes and enjoy bigger profits.
3:43
Just four firms
3:45
control 85% of all beef,
3:48
66% of all pork,
3:50
and 54% of all poultry production.
3:55
Firms like Tyson have seen their profit margins skyrocket
3:59
as they jack up prices higher than their costs
4:02
— forcing consumers who are already stretched thin
4:04
to pay even more.
4:06
It's not just meat.
4:07
Weak antitrust enforcement
4:09
has allowed companies to become powerful enough
4:12
to raise their prices across the entire food industry.
4:16
It's the same story with household goods.
4:19
Giant companies like Procter and Gamble,
4:21
they blame their price hikes on increased costs,
4:24
but their profit margins have soared to 25%.
4:28
Hello?
4:29
They care more about their bottom line
4:33
than your bottom.
4:35
Meanwhile, parents — and even grandparents like me —
4:38
are still struggling to feed their babies
4:40
because of a national formula shortage.
4:42
Why? Largely because the three companies
4:45
that control the entire formula industry
4:47
would rather pump money into stock buybacks
4:50
than quality control at their factories.
The real economy
4:55
Traditionally, our economy's health is measured by
4:59
the unemployment rate.
5:01
Job growth.
5:03
The stock market.
5:03
Overall economic growth.
5:06
But these don't reflect the everyday
5:08
“kitchen table economics” that affect our lives the most.
5:13
These measures don't show the real economy.
5:17
Instead of looking just at the number of jobs,
5:19
we need to look at the income earned from those jobs.
5:23
And not the average income.
5:24
I mean, people at the top always bring up the average.
5:26
If Jeff Bezos walked into a bar with 100 average
5:29
working people, the average wealth of each person
5:32
would suddenly be over a billion dollars.
5:35
No, look here, at the median income
5:39
— half above, half below.
5:41
And make sure it accounts for inflation.
5:43
That is real purchasing power.
5:45
Over the last few decades,
5:47
the real median income has barely budged.
5:51
This isn’t economic success.
5:54
It's economic failure,
5:55
with a capital F.
5:58
And instead of looking at the stock market or the GDP,
6:01
we need to look at who owns what,
6:04
where the wealth really is.
6:07
Over the last 40 years, wealth has concentrated
6:10
more and more at the very top.
6:14
Look at this.
6:15
This is a problem, folks, because with wealth
6:18
comes political power.
6:25
Forget trickle down economics.
6:27
It's trickle on.
6:35
And instead of looking just at economic
6:36
growth, we also need to
6:38
look at what that growth is costing us.
6:40
Subtract the costs of the climate crisis,
6:43
the cost of bad health, the costs of no paid leave,
6:47
and all the stresses on our lives
6:49
that economic growth is demanding.
6:51
We need to look at the quality of our lives
6:54
— all our lives.
6:56
How many of us are adequately housed and clothed and fed?
7:00
How many of our kids are getting a good education?
7:03
How many of us live in safety or in fear?
7:09
You want to measure economic success?
7:12
Go to the kitchen tables of America.

you're walking around downtown among the
0:02
beautiful historic buildings each of
0:03
them is unique with different colors and
0:05
ornaments you then turn a corner and oh
0:08
it's one of those newly built areas full
0:10
of sterile non-descript boxes gone is
0:13
the charm the atmosphere and the
0:15
character of the Lively Historic
0:16
downtown it's only sterilized cultural
0:18
Dead Zone you press Zone and eventually
0:20
reach the office area which is even
0:22
worse even the meager individual
0:24
characteristics of those new residential
0:26
blocks are gone it's all just a bunch of
0:28
glass cubes how depressing that's it I
0:31
can't take this anymore I need to go to
0:32
the store to get myself a oh God wait a
0:35
sec you know those old beautiful Market
0:37
Halls people used to shop in well now
0:39
it's all big metal boxes what is going
0:41
on here why do all new buildings look so
0:43
Bland and depressing compared to the old
0:45
ones how come we don't build quote
0:47
unquote beautiful buildings anymore
0:48
let's find out the Story begins in the
0:51
late 19th early 20th century
0:53
architectural Styles like neoclassical
0:55
were still widespread in the developed
0:57
world but a new movement was emerging
1:01
modernism hit the architectural scene
1:04
its main tenets are minimalism the
1:06
rejection of ornament and the idea that
1:08
form should follow function ah so that's
1:10
why we don't build nice buildings
1:11
anymore those stupid talentless
1:13
progressives back then came up with
1:15
their stupid soulless architectural
1:16
style and forced it upon the world so
1:18
now all new buildings are ugly right no
Modern Architecture
1:22
it's a decent plot for a Disney movie
1:23
but reality is a bit more complex I'm
1:25
afraid see modernism care about in an
1:27
era of technological Revolution new and
1:29
Innovative building materials like glass
1:31
and steel and reinforced concrete
1:33
enabled buildings never before seen or
1:35
even thought possible examples of
1:37
modernist architecture include the
1:39
Sydney Opera House the Empire State
1:40
Building and this little known Landmark
1:42
called the Eiffel Tower a big part of
1:45
the reason why modernism got so popular
1:46
is that after so many years of dominance
1:48
by the old people were simply ready for
1:50
something new instead of Stuffy stuck up
1:53
over decorated buildings we had Falling
1:55
Water Villa tugentad pale de chayu the
1:58
Rockefeller Center and a whole lot more
2:00
fresh and modern buildings you wouldn't
2:02
unironically put on the 17th century
2:04
outfit for your job interview would you
2:06
now you will go for a relatively
2:07
minimalistic yet elegant suit or a dress
2:09
because well because 17th century guards
2:12
just aren't the thing nowadays the idea
2:14
is the same with building ornamentation
2:16
changing tastes throughout the times
2:17
however there are some additional far
2:20
more interesting reasons and before we
2:22
get into those I'd like to thank
2:23
athletic greens for a spot
2:26

thank you for checking out ag1 by
3:25
athletic greens Edge like this support
3:26
me in creating more content for you and
3:28
now back to the video so as we discussed
3:31
a reason why buildings nowadays have
3:32
less ornaments is changing tastes
3:34
throughout the times now this is all
3:35
well and good but it doesn't explain
3:37
save Soviet apartment blocks or similar
3:39
large-scale public housing virtually
3:41
nobody finds these buildings good
3:42
looking or interesting so there must be
3:44
something else in the background other
3:45
than changing tastes there is an idea in
3:47
far-right conspiracy circles that
3:49
actually modern architecture is a plot
3:51
by the shadowy elites to crush the
3:52
spirit of white civilization so they can
3:54
import non-white into developed
3:56
countries to dilute the culture and the
3:58
white gene pool because of reasons and
Public Housing
4:01
this might be an interesting plot for a
4:02
South Park episode but as usual reality
4:04
is a bit more complicated do comic
4:07
blocks and similar large-scale public
4:08
housing projects look sometimes Bland or
4:10
uninspiring sure but they weren't built
4:13
as a form of architectural expression
4:14
they were simply not made to look
4:16
beautiful in Europe following World War
4:18
II there was a massive housing crisis
4:20
basically everywhere so States set up
4:22
massive public housing programs in the
4:24
Soviet sphere of influence this was done
4:25
via soccer old house factories where
4:27
they mass produced standardized elements
4:29
that workers could put together on site
4:30
thus massive amounts of housing could be
4:32
built at a low cost relatively quickly
4:34
and it worked combing blocks essentially
4:36
solved the housing crisis and for a time
4:38
anyway they also represented a
4:40
civilizational shift for their new
4:41
inhabitants who often moved in from
4:43
buildings without electricity or indoor
4:45
plumbing if you want to know more about
4:46
comic blocks I have a whole video about
4:48
them feel free to check it out so next
4:49
time you hear someone say that public
4:51
housing apartment blocks are a communist
4:53
plot to crush the human Spirit or
4:54
something while being homeless or not
4:56
having access to running water or
4:58
perhaps bigger threats to human Spirit
4:59
who knows also imagine if some local
5:01
government spent its public housing
5:03
money on ornamentation instead of
5:05
building as many units as possible hello
5:07
citizens we only Built seven blocks out
5:09
of 10 due to higher element costs so
5:10
hundreds of you will not have a roof
5:12
over your heads but hey look how
5:13
beautiful these seven blocks are now
5:15
you'll have something nice to look at
5:16
from under the bridge so there's our
Housing Shortages
5:18
second reason why we don't always build
5:19
nice buildings housing shortages but
5:22
this still doesn't explain this latest
5:23
onslaught of same-looking buildings in
5:25
the US and Europe such buildings are
5:27
absolutely everywhere and spreading
5:29
they're Bland and boring uninspired
5:31
depressing and so on though to be fair
5:32
the US is more affected by this than
5:34
Europe so why do developers keep
5:36
spamming these buildings it's not like
5:38
they're part of a massive standardized
5:39
public housing project we're living
5:41
under neoliberal capitalism which
5:43
happens to be the reason why those
5:45
buildings look the way they look you see
5:46
from the late 20th century onward
5:48
housing was increasingly looked at not
5:50
as spaces to live but its Commodities to
5:52
be bought and sold this culminated in
5:54
the 2000s housing bubble and the
5:55
consequent 2008 economic crisis people
5:58
simply stopped planning for durability
5:59
quality and proper Aesthetics just get
6:02
the cheapest materials you can put up a
6:04
building that looks reasonably nice and
6:05
sell it at inflated prices due to their
6:07
low quality construction the buildings
6:09
will start falling apart in a few years
6:10
but it doesn't matter since by then you
6:12
will have already made your money and
6:13
the building would be on its seventh
6:15
owner who is looking to sell it at an
6:16
even higher price housing went from
Profit Motive
6:18
places to live to a speculation scheme a
6:20
hot potato match among investors but
6:22
when the music stopped everyone went
6:25
bankrupt aside from outright speculation
6:27
there is also the good old-fashioned
6:28
profit motive let's take a developer who
6:30
wants to put up a new building to rent
6:32
or sell the units suppose we present
6:33
them with architectural templates
6:35
neoclassical Art Deco Baroque Revival
6:37
and the average 5 over 1. 10 times out
6:40
of 10 they'll pick the five over one
6:41
ending door to rest why because it's the
6:44
cheapest Ergo will make the most money
6:45
with it turns out five over ones are
6:47
built using standardized materials that
6:49
can be mass produced keeping costs down
6:51
even if the quality is questionable well
6:53
it only needs to hold together till the
6:55
end of the warranty period then it's the
6:57
new owner's problem or in case of
6:58
renting developers can just keep blaming
7:00
the tenants for defects and deduct
7:02
repairs from their deposits a developer
7:04
could spend the boatload of money on a
7:05
durable brick neoclassical apartment
7:07
building with tons of ornamentation but
7:09
that won't affect the rent or unit price
7:10
all that much since the three most
7:12
important aspects of real estate or
7:14
location location and location if you
7:16
are a developer building units in a
7:18
desirable location as long as the units
7:20
are most inhabitable that's all you need
7:22
really you'll have made your money this
7:23
story is the same with Office Buildings
7:25
and large shopping centers as we do not
7:27
mass-produce classical ornaments they
7:29
would need to be custom made for each
7:30
building at prohibitive costs but how
7:32
come companies don't want to build
7:33
something representative still why
7:36
aren't say Walmart's built nice like
7:37
those Old Market halls with that we
7:39
arrive at the fourth factor and what
7:41
would that be recently the beautiful art
7:43
Novi fasado Prague main station was
7:45
renovated the station regained its
7:47
former splendor but almost nobody
7:49
noticed because no one is there to see
7:51
it because there's an urban freeway and
7:53
an elevated parking lot right in front
7:54
of it if you want to experience the for
7:56
someone's architectural Beauty you have
7:58
to crawl through dark piss smelling
7:59
underpasses and grimy rusted spiral
8:02
stairs and stand in the middle of a
8:03
concrete parking lot next to an urban
8:05
freeway hardly a conducive environment
8:06
for savoring the Arts core centered
Core Centered Areas
8:08
areas actively sabotage architectural
8:10
Beauty why would anyone bother building
8:12
something good looking or waste money an
8:14
ornamentation when no one will be around
8:16
to appreciate it even if you build a
8:18
good-looking Walmart that isn't just a
8:19
big metal box who cares people will just
8:21
park their cars Scurry inside do their
8:23
show shopping and then drive away nobody
8:25
stays around the stroll to talk to hang
8:27
out to take in the beauty around them
8:29
what could is a beautiful building when
8:31
your city is built for cars cars don't
8:33
appreciate architectural Beauty people
8:34
do but for that they have to be around
8:36
and if roads in your city look like this
8:38
and sound like this
8:42
nobody will stick around in which case
8:44
why even bother building anything nice
8:46
aside from Urban motor traffic parking
8:48
minimums are also to blame here those
8:50
old atmospheric human-centric beautiful
8:52
areas would be illegal to build today
8:54
due to parking requirements the current
8:56
laws in much of the world actually
8:58
prescribe core infested cities and force
9:00
developers to build a ton of parking for
9:02
new buildings which then induces even
9:03
more car traffic and drives up
9:05
construction costs thus areas become
9:07
congested thus there will be less people
9:09
hanging around and suddenly you don't
9:10
need to build anything good looking
9:11
anymore people will be looking at the
9:13
road in front of them not at the
9:15
buildings and even if a developer wanted
9:17
to pay for ornamentation despite
9:18
everything well unfortunately the
9:20
underground garage they were forced to
9:22
build due to parking minimums ate all
9:23
their ornament money but hey at least
9:25
Karen can comfortably Park her rezvani
9:27
Vengeance SUV equipped with bulletproof
9:29
glass explosive underbody Shield
9:30
electrified door handles built-in pepper
9:33
spray and a loudspeaker
9:36
so to answer the question of why we
9:39
don't build a corner called Beautiful
9:40
buildings anymore and by that people
9:41
colloquial I mean ornamented pre-modern
9:43
buildings the reasons we've pinpointed
9:45
are as follows day is changing with the
9:47
times sheer necessity to House people
9:49
housing becoming a commodity instead of
9:51
places to live and course-centric urban
9:52
planning so next time you see a new
9:55
quote-unquote ugly building you'll know
9:57
why it's there no conspiracy just taste
9:59
necessity capitalism or cars and this is
10:02
not to say we stopped building nice
10:03
things beauty can come from places other
10:05
than ornament take the three biggest
10:07
stations in
10:10
budapesti are beautiful but so is daily
10:12
just in a different way and personally
10:14
deal is my favorite of them all anyway
10:16
there was my excuse to talk about rail

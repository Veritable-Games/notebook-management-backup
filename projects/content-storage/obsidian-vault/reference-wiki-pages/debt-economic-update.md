# debt-economic-update
going to be more excited to now turn to look at debt. We do so with an eye toward the
debt of various nations around the world and then we'll take a look at consumer debt
to do so. We're pleased again and honored to have with us Professor of Economic Emeritus
at Richard Wolf, who joins us from our New York Studios Professor. Happy New Year, welcome back.
Happy New Year to you and I'm glad to be here. So, you know, I had we had a guy on Professor
that was three, four months ago. He has not been on the show since because I ask him about debt.
He said, well, debt doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Again, it hasn't been on the show since.
But why does debt matter and does who controls the debt or owns the debt? Does that matter, Professor?
Well, I could not be more clear. Debt matters enormously because what it means is some people,
the borrowers, have an obligation and they have an obligation to take whatever money they get,
however they get it and not spend it on goods and services, but shift it over to other people
who are the lenders and that affects everything about how an economy works. Governments who are
big borrowers in the world economy typically do so because politicians find it easier for their
own development and their own success to borrow money from the people they would otherwise have to
tax. In other words, excuse me, to take an example from the United States, last December we'd
gave an enormous tax cut to corporations and the rich. Then the government, not getting that money
anymore from them, had during 2018 to find the money some other way. It borrowed the money
that it needed to have to make its expenditures and ironically it borrowed a good bit of the money
from the corporations and rich people whose taxes it had lowered. So it ended up with an obligation
to pay all those people back plus interest whereas if it had not done so, had taxed them originally
in December the way it should have otherwise, it wouldn't have a debt. So the notion that it doesn't
matter misunderstands the enormous impact that debt has on every country, on every corporation and on
every family that turns to that experience as part of its financial life. I want to get to some
graph in a moment guys but first professor I want to just back up just a little bit. So when you say
that the U.S. then lent the was loan the money from these companies that got the tax cut,
that reminds me you know people would also say well and then China holds U.S. debt. What you're
actually saying and make sure that I'm correct on this professor is that somebody else is holding
our bonds, our treasury notes. So when we say either these companies like you just said or we say
China holds a debt, what you mean is that they are buying our bonds, is that correct?
That's right and all of bond is is what we used to call an IOU, a good set of letters because it
means that the United States government, let's take the example you gave of China, the United States
government didn't want, couldn't get its way around, taxing its own companies, its own wealthy
people. I won't say the mass of people because we already overtaxed them in this country anyway but
it won't tax corporations in the rich and what it does instead is not only borrow from them
but also borrow from other countries if the other countries are willing to lend. It's ironic
for Americans to understand that the United States is the biggest debtor country in the world
and the people's Republic of China is the biggest creditor of the United States in the world.
So that means every year and this is really important. Tens of billions of dollars of American
taxpayer money paid to the government is used by the United States government not to provide
schools or hospitals or roads but simply to pay interest to the people's Republic of China
which receives this financial benefit every year even as the politicians make statements critical
of China we as a nation because of those politicians decisions are funding the people's Republic
of China. Well it's a good thing professor that they don't have either the Chinese or the
corporations latitude to hike our interest rates because we give this or that terrible tweet or say
something nasty about them. I want to shift and talk about the global business where a global
business finance program so let's look around the world at debt as a share of gross domestic product
and the chart we have here shows the percentage of debt versus GDP since 2007 and it shows Japan and
the U.S. and the U.K. as sort of the leaders with a high debt to GDP ratio in Germany as a low debt
as a share of GDP what's your take on these numbers professor? Well you know the answer is pretty
simple when the global capitalist system crashed in 2008 many governments particularly for example
the United States the United Kingdom and Japan among others rushed in to try to prevent that
crash of the stock markets from becoming another great depression and the way they did that was to
pump money into the economy and to drop interest rates that in turn stimulated every potential borrower
every politician who borrows money for the government every corporate executive who borrows
money for their company they now took advantage of these low interest rates to borrow like there
was no tomorrow because it was cheap to do that and for a while that gave a kind of artificial
debt boost to the economy the problem is those chickens are coming home to roost now we now have
an economy with problems with an overhang of all of this accumulated debt here's the irony the
last crisis of capitalism in 2008 was handled by dropping interest rates and pumping up debt
we are now going into another one in 2019 or 20 when the big question is how much will that
overhang of debt make the next downturn as bad or maybe even worse than the one we just barely
emerged from a professor we're out of time but I want to have you back I hope you'll come back
in the next few days maybe next week and talk about consumer debt we wanted to get to that but
I didn't want to interrupt you because you were hitting on all these important points we thank you
so much professor Richard Wolf professor of economics of America's University of Massachusetts
thank you happy new year again take care you too

--------------------

We spoke about debt by nation and today we take a quick view of US consumer debt and at G7
disposable income before talking about income in the quality highlighted by those yellow
vest protesters in France.
To do so, we are pleased and honored to once again be joined by Professor Emeritus, University
of Massachusetts.
Amherst Professor Richard will professor great to see you again.
Thank you, Bob.
Glad to be here.
So, Americans now owe more than ever.
Consumer debt, which takes in credit cards and personal and student loans, is over
four trillion bucks this year.
At the same time, mortgage levels are nearly as high as they were before.
The housing crisis, we're just talking about the Great Recession, with homeowners
owing 10.3 trillion bucks in the most recent data.
That's up by 2.8% year over year.
These seem like pretty horrific numbers to me, but you're the economist professor.
What do they mean to you?
Well, they're pretty scary and I think you don't need to be an economist to know that
if you have not learned the lesson of the last credit collapse, the subprime mortgage collapse
we used to call it back in 2008 and 2009, you should, because these numbers indicate
that even if people learn the lesson, the fact is that the incomes of most Americans
and this is true in other countries too, simply did not go up over the last decade,
while the cost of leading a decent life, getting your kids a college education if possible,
having a vacation once in a while, cost more, your income didn't go up,
and your solution, even if you were worried, was to borrow more money.
And again, the basic law of economics.
If your underlying income is not going up, but your debt levels are,
it's only a matter of when, not whether that you're going to hit crunch time
and the economy is going to crack because people can't keep going,
they can't even service the debt they have, and so they can't buy goods and services,
and then we have the crash.
It's a horrific feeling for some of us.
It's like being on a train rushing towards a stone wall, everybody sees it,
but seems unable to take the steps to prevent the disaster.
It's almost like a death spiral, and it reminds me it's been a long time since a URI,
probably watched Sesame Street, but you know, you have all these things that look the same,
increasing housing, increasing transportation, increase health care,
but income's not increasing.
Which thing does not look like the other, and its income, as you say.
But I want to take a look at the wider world, at least at the G7 countries,
professor, in terms of disposable income.
If it were like the old school G8, which included Russia,
Russia would actually be at lowest in terms of disposable income.
But of the current G7 members, when we look at this chart,
actually Canada, and the UK citizens, have more disposable income,
Italy, the lowest, and in the middle of the pack, Germany, the US, and Japan,
and France.
What do you make of these numbers of household debt?
Again, I think they're frightening.
I think what we're seeing is the grudgingly more and more people are loading up
with one or another kind of debt.
I think that behind many of the political events of our time is the anxiety of people
who don't see rising incomes, but do see rising debts.
And that's a very depressing situation.
I think it lies in part behind the anger of the British people to vote against
staying in Europe, which isn't going to solve their problem.
It's behind the anger of the American people, voting for Trump,
which isn't going to solve their problem.
And in France, you see it with this yellow vest movement,
because they've made it crystal clear that the combination of weak income,
no future, and rising debts is what brings them into the street.
I think you're seeing the building of a kind of pressure cooker in which debt
is playing a very central role in galvanizing people's uneasiness
about where their economies are taking them.
Well, let's move to that, because you know, when it...
It's not just the U.S. I mean, we've got some specific problems we've spoken about in the U.S.
But, you know, income inequality is a problem, the world over.
And I just wonder if this circumstance with the yellow vest protesters in France
is really a microcosm of a movement that might be beginning.
You know, it started with just a couple of issues.
Now it really seems to have emerged professor into more income inequality overall.
Do you think as those figures and that they have, that they have nots
and one thing doesn't seem like the other, as those continue to exacerbate,
are we going to theme more of this, do you think?
The more of these protests, more of these concerns by average folks
who've just sort of mad as hell and not going to take it anymore?
I'm convinced that you are already seeing it.
There have been yellow vests in Belgium.
There has been a sizable yellow vest movement in the Netherlands.
It is already major news across Europe.
But I don't think it's going to stop not only because it's already some evidence of it.
I think that there is a combination of building anger and rage from below
and a level of being out of touch with it at the top that promises more trouble.
Let me give you one illustration.
This morning, in France, Mr. Macron, the president,
named a woman minister who would run the debate that he's called for
over the issues raised by the yellow vest movement,
mostly issues about the mass of the French people not having enough money to live a decent life.
The newspapers in France this morning published the income that would be earned by the minister
who would lead this discussion, a woman who, by the way, has already resigned.
Her income was to be in the neighborhood of 200,000 US dollars, the equivalent.
Okay, that is so crazy.
That is so insulting to the mass of the French people that it will stimulate more yellow vest.
It's so outrageous, it kind of boggles the mind.
But it suggests the inability of those sitting at the top to even understand
the most basic reality motivating those at the bottom.
And that's a sign of a lot of trouble coming down the pike.
Professor, before we go and ask you one other question,
I apologize, this sort of comes out of left field.
I know you're not a political analyst, but you're just as good as anybody else if not better.
So you think about Catalonia, you think about Brexit, you think about Donald Trump in the US.
And I wonder if these movements, political movements, if you will,
where people have just said, we've had enough.
Are they, do you think, a reflection also of this inequality gap?
Or do you think there's something different?
No, I'm convinced it's the inequality gap.
Look, here's the way I make sense of it.
Dealing with the inequality gap puts you right up against the capitalist economic system that we live with.
It is very scary, especially after half a century of Cold War,
to think, let alone act around the notion that the economic system you've accepted and lived with
is what has to change, what maybe even has to go, because of the inequality.
So people look for something else that they can change in the hope,
vain, I believe, but in the honest hope that maybe if we're British and we get out of Europe,
or maybe if we're American and we don't let refugees and immigrants from Central America in,
or if we're in Hungary and we don't let desperate people from Syria in,
that change will deal with what upsetting us.
It won't, it'll take a few years before that's clear to people,
but I think these are what we call displacements of an economic problem,
inequality, our economic system, but there are still enough people scared of dealing with that issue
that they look for something else they can change in the kind of almost mystical hope
that getting out of Europe or blocking the border or something like that
will get them back to some sort of economic equilibrium.
It won't, we've been there, we've done that, it's too little and it's too late.
You've got to deal with the economic problem because in the end, that's the problem that we have to solve.
Well, we're going to continue to talk about it.
We so much appreciate your assistance in that regard.
Professor Richard, well, thank you, Professor, appreciate it.
Thank you, I'm glad to do it.

This is Richard Wolf from Democracy at Work, responding to another Ask Prof Wolf question
from our Patreon community.
This question comes from Mir Usman, and it asks about the so-called debt trap of the situation
that particularly afflicts countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, but elsewhere
too, in which special problems they have, like COVID-19, or long-term economic development
problems they have had for decades, put them in a position of having to borrow money.
And they borrow money, usually from countries who give foreign aid or from banks who are
doing this to make money.
This kind of use of credit to help a country solve its problems is as old as capitalism,
maybe even a little bit older, before capitalism, when banks did this too.
And it has a terrible habit of growing forever.
First the bank borrows for assuming the country borrows from the bank for a particular project,
but then it has an additional problem.
Even more often the borrowers are political people, the government of a country, and they
use a part of the loan to be politically successful in their country, with only the rest of it
going to help develop the country.
And that doesn't generate enough growth to pay off the loan.
And who then has to do it, the mass of people.
So now the debt becomes a social problem.
And with all the other economic development problems in what we used to call the third world,
having to pay debt to a foreign bank is just an additional one.
And when it becomes difficult to do it, well, you go back and you borrow even more money
to pay off the debt you weren't able to pay before.
You put all these things together.
And third world countries, as we used to call them, developing countries, we call them
now, are constantly struggling with debt and never more so than now.
Keep in mind that when you read that the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates here in
the United States, many of those countries have borrowed and have to refinance at a higher
interest rate, costing them even more money that they don't have.
And Mir Usman says, how do we get out of this?
Is there a way to get out of it?
Do the country sometimes tax their own people to help pay for these loans that have accumulated?
The answer is, most of the time, they defer maintaining their roads to use the money to
pay off the debts.
They're like desperate people who are loaded up with too much debt and are then tempted
to borrow even more to get through the interest payments they have to make now.
Is there then an escape?
I'm afraid the answer is yes, it is.
There is one, but you have to face the politics of it because that's the core issue.
Most of the countries in debt have leading elite groups, corporations, big businesses,
local and foreign and wealthy people.
And much of the economic borrowing that the country did was because it did not have the
political strength, the political background, the political will to tax those in their
society who really could pay foreign and domestic corporations and the local rich.
As long as you don't do that, you're going to be confronting debt problems.
That's part of what it means to be a third world country.
And the irony of history has been those countries who refuse to play the game, who were
ostracized because they refused to play the game.
Because the ultimate threat to the little third world country in Asia, Africa and Latin
America is if you don't pay off the past debts, we won't give you anymore.
And then what will you do?
Your own people will throw you out of office because you weren't able to get the debt
to build the dam, to fix the roads, to recover from the hurricane, whatever it was.
And very few countries have the political will.
So the irony is, if you're shut off for other reasons, you may discover almost by accident
that in the long run, you're better off not borrowing and relying on your own resources.
And the best example in the world right now is the people's Republic of China.
Having made a communist revolution in 1949, they were cut off from credit.
The way most socialist and communist countries were.
And they had to do it on their own.
And they went after their rich people.
That was part of what their revolutions were about.
And they raised the resources from inside and ended up with a better story of working
their way out of the underdevelopment than all those countries that are relied on all
those debts, all those years.
So yes, there is a way out, but you need to have strong, mass-based political leaders
with the will to say no, to solve the problems not only internally, but with help of countries
like China who have their own reasons to help you to get out of the trap.
There is that way, but it is as so often a fundamentally political issue.

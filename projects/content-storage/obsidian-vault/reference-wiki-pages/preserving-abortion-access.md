We've all seen the horror stories coming out of Texas and Florida, knowing that I'm going to give birth and watch my child pass.
But did you know that even in a blue state like Massachusetts or New York or California,
you're not safe if a nationwide abortion ban gets passed in Washington?
Now to understand why, it's first important to understand the extraordinary success that activists have made at the state level.
While the end of road worked a new era of cruelty, it also sparked a new era of organizing,
Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and now all eyes are on Florida and many other states fighting to put reproductive freedom on the ballot in November.
These activists inspire me every day and they are making a difference for patients right now.
But all this progress could be threatened after the election this November.
We are facing two scenarios here.
Scenario number one.
If Democrats keep control of the White House and the Senate and win the House in November, we can pass a national law legalizing abortion.
This will enshrine reproductive freedom into federal law and it will overturn the cruel abortion bands
that Republicans have put in place at the state level.
Scenario number two.
Now brace yourself for this one.
If Republicans win control of the White House, the Senate and the House, just like they did in 2016,
they can pass a nationwide abortion ban now that Rome has fallen and they are giddy to do it.
And if the Republicans don't have enough numbers to pass it through Congress,
a Republican president like Donald Trump can twist the law to get it done through executive authority.
It will invalidate all of the progress the states have made because federal law overrides state law.
No one in red states or blue states would be safe at that point.
It's a nightmare scenario and it's what motivates me every day to make sure that Republicans don't win in November.
So when people say, are you getting involved in the elections?
The answer is, of course I am.
I care about abortion and that's why I'm volunteering for Joe Biden.
That's why I'm volunteering in this Senate race.
That's why I'm volunteering in this House race.
That's why I'm sending in 10 bucks to help.
Remind everyone that abortion is on the ballot.
And along the way, we need to keep supporting abortion initiatives in states across the country.
If it makes a difference for just one patient between now and the election, that would be enough.
This won't be easy.
Important fights never are.
But we have the strength and we have the numbers.
I'm in this fight all the way because the stakes are too high not to be.

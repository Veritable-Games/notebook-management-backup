The player needs a belt of sorts and a means of swapping weapons, so let's say you have
You can carry two things. Give us up, all right
Maybe put it in one other thing in your back
Carrying things will be a form of panic
You can carry whatever else
You can climb one hand


# REC002.txt
Let's go look at that one hand, that's an entrance to the river.
Does that say the right job? Perhaps something.
You can do the wire, say you press the trigger button.
Insert the trigger into the water.
It's also the trigger for a small function.
It's just a dark trigger for a small function.
I don't know.
I think we got that there.
It's not best if we are just scratch one of them.


# REC003.txt
So if the player should be able to traverse with one hand in VR if they need to, I just
mean jumping by pressing the trigger really towards the first one I jump, I'm magic to
it, no grapple either really, it's more like a, yeah, I'm just jumping, they're
leaping in the direction near alt buna.


# REC004.txt
No, I'm not sure if I can emulate that one.
Gamepad, but that's okay, I can still make Gamepad fun.
I'm finding a way to balance the both.
I do want it to both.


# REC005.txt
I haven't had a lot of experience stating, but I've had a lot of wonderful experiences.
Let me see you find in that kind of relationship.
It's hard to describe so much, but it's vivid in my mind.
I've had a lot of experience stating, but it's vivid in my mind.
I've had a lot of experience stating, but it's vivid in my mind.


# REC006.txt
This was if I could laugh at my own self, I would use it to be.
I've come along with a long way since then, I need to think of characters now.


# REC007.txt
I'm going to run my mouth with whatever it is I'm going to burst it out, just illiterate.
Okay, so I'm going to trace an engineer from mother and father, and both of the passion for engineering
for the excavation being done above them.
At the cities, edge, and the base of the analyst on their brother up.
There's so much space, but there's this one operation.
This is the central point, the point in which there is the least resistance.
They feel it's the best spot to dig.
It's not zero-g, but it's optimal for human life and up over.
This is what they're about to civilization.
They had to choose one, that's what it is.
I want to be tough there, I'm getting this.
It can't drop the water.
Let's put it out and freeze my face.


# REC008.txt
My grandfather was a grave keeper, and my father was an architect.
But the industry advanced.
He couldn't keep up with the advances in the industry.
And he found better stability in Mexico.
I don't know what it is, but I need that.
Keep dreaming.


# REC009.txt
Many people in this world have tried to go to a metal, their metal, getting your metal.
It's a signifier, it's letting go of what the bottle aspects are, just necessarily.
They're willing to let go of the body, because you know the mind is everything that matters.
Like you're letting go of the nervousness to adapt to what you see, with the curls, not just
the ones you have, so getting your metal, like we're releasing an arm, we're releasing
a leg, and when someone feels they've crossed a threshold, they will, they can.
Remove the torso, the face, the head even, just to retain the brain.
I think got off your motor with oil.


# REC010.txt
The player has effectively this skeleton of a metal without the brain.
The dodeck is subject to where the brain would be.
Space's skeleton gets through round.
Now they can, over time,
trade metals with other people as they get more drastic components.
So see, their metal is wonderfully designed,
and someone is saying,
oh, I'm getting a new one,
market soon, would you like this one?
You can take it,
utilize it in a different way,
say, your metal doesn't do anything special,
but this metal gives you a grapple hook,
gives you a,
this replacement for your leg,
this new, awesome looking,
badass piece of thing you found
that was left rust
or anything you're able to repair or maintain
or let's say that's all it takes.
It takes resources to maintain your stuff,
and you can resources by exploring the world.
Eventually you run resources,
sorry, you run off.
Well, you need to get the exertions
when they need to help us to open them.
You traverse,
you obtain,
not currency,
but,
no, there's no currency,
there's no resources to repair,
you maintain,
you take the time to,
you have resources,
you can work shop,
and you take the time to just fix it,
all the resources are there for you to use.


# REC011.txt
Take time to repair your things is what I want to say
But the research is here limit it. You just need to take the time
Just let you down bring you to the social area
But there's also the case of
The also case of the most the case of


# REC012.txt
So basic equipment, they can be upgraded, replaced or traded, you can trade metals, and
trading metals, or she comes with relationships, you explore with someone, you talk to someone,
and you spend time with them we see, and say none of the numbers, not every NPC offers
them at all, but when you've made a kind of a special relationship, a kind of relationship
you sent a lot of time with this person, they may offer it to you, and you could trade
it here in the client, and they'll ask what pieces you have for metal struttle.


# REC013.txt
Those metal being your left arm, your right arm, your right leg, your left leg, oh let me get the socks, your back
I would give you the hypothetical double drop, your little boost with real mechanics


# REC014.txt
Essentially, when the player is obtained the hypothetical best metals, really, or the Dave,
they're really comfortable with metals they have, they've been changed in a while.
I should attempt a story, sort of, and the strict triggers it.
They keep all of their bodies, but they get a boost in power, all of their skills are
either in faster-versal speed or grappling on or faster climbing speed or
just boosted bodies in the feeling of the game.
I guess
the, uh, Dorek, uh, geez, I'm rolling back here.


# REC015.txt
So, the Dodeck, a crystalline structure, right?
It's a Dodeck hatred, but then the branches grow out there.
The general squirrel, before I figure it.
The character, of course, is a musculature, that's right to move it, but it's more of a physical
chemical flavor that needs them over time, and it needs them too much.
It's going to go down again, so it needs to find water sources, that's selling drawback.
So, instead of going to repair stuff, you're going down a great, interesting, dreaded session.
And let's go back and get a new set of batteries, I've got a branch down, I've got a roof
down here, I've got a lot of players who use the special metals, where they have my
new one, they just have those, but don't use it for example, it's just a different type
of metal.
It's better if I don't put that inside the body, I can't say, but the more it is, it's all
the more interesting ones, that's all there is, new gifts, new items, new hats, new


# REC016.txt
It's really, it's really fletched, I can't go back in and outside the mechanized versions
of themselves, the older, the younger versions, the best story in the stories, one player at
the time, really. But these machines can join them, so it's an educational club, it's
a prof. So are you getting by your friends, yes? And so it's got to be educational, I'm going
to find a way to make it social, in a way I want it to be. Creativity is from stuff to
do, physicalize, that you need the resources, the funding to do it. For now is the foundation,
the exploratory space, and I get a deeper, I get a bit better. And these are the constraints
for scope, so let me get a couple of salaries, it works, and if you're out together


# REC017.txt
I'm gonna be in one myself, that's for sure, but at least I figured it out.


# REC018.txt
Landing and colonization process.


# REC019.txt
versions with nouns.


# REC020.txt
I have built it some water across the surface, I might need to model the drain.


# REC021.txt
So imagine a future where you might need a dense to live and definitely life extension
that's enabled us to survive, to persist, first of all if we need to, if we want to.
We have humans that have forgotten their limbs, replaced them with metals, metals, no
your metal, your metal, your metal, and these components are more new to the person
because they're, they can go off through organic if the ultimately unimportant relative to
the mind.
The brain is the only thing that matters that the face, just the brain really, but the other
components are the face is useful, the body is also useful, but that's not that.
That's right.


# REC022.txt
So the settlement, you keep the head, you keep the mind, the brain, the face, and the center of the system, the upper neck.
Not so much neck, really, but you know that you can...
So the don't near as they happen, actually frozen them, it's not grow genetic, it's actually pretty silly, because when you freeze something,
what happens? Water expands.
And it hurts.
So matter what happens, it's not a cell, it has a creases.
Well, it expands and destroys the cell.
So, to prevent this, you keep it in a...
You flush the system with an empty freezing agent.
For six minutes, after death.


# REC023.txt
You take this out, it's a flaw in the new version, the end of racing version, the end
of racing version, you keep it at a moderate temperature, the front decay of cells, the
front full cell stuff, they're retained in the state they are and good
time for that to be brought back with the right day of lunch, $30,000.


# REC024.txt
game and the VR game are totally different in the third-person game you play as
the Dotaque, the Demo, but in first person in VR you play as a sophomore, your own avatar you built them
they come into life and it's just silent they cry
hey
im alive
I'm alive
i'm alive
30,000 years.


# REC025.txt
So your carriage model is tilted in about 12 degrees.
You can see the bed light chamber here in.
Let you notice there are some intergal housings.
All around the room, and some shorerunner, but they're not kept alive, they're all
not fake and they're level.


# REC026.txt
They're making the digital enabled with the AR display.
No, they're physical enabled. That's just practical.
It's not meant to be...
No, you can... Yeah, AR is useful, because you can get a work ratio.
Tap it, and it's like, okay, this is the little person.
This is their background, where they were, etc.
You can look down, you can learn them, learn them up.
It's just a photograph of that person, whatever image they wanted to use, like, never dies.
No, no realness. Yeah, it should be bad, man.
Yeah, it should be bad of that person.
A photograph of that person, for the next.


# REC027.txt
The character wake up and wakes up here and they have a sort of a place on their body.
And the place on their body is the one they customize.
It's the main menu.
And it's too much.
Well, yes, but I think that we're gonna have, so your character comes to them and they have a skill at the most.
It's basically a must-for-letcher on it.
But it's mechanical must-for-letcher.
Let me let it.
It's all gray.
It's supposed to be red.
Or beige, really.
I had a fight right going for that, but I'm imagining it.
I can actually felt this in the evening.
Or is that sounds?
I can feel this.
I feel that I'm a character anyway.


# REC028.txt
So, the sephalum and the totac sephalum is only the head, don't think it's body-bendle
head.
It's just a figure.
You can customize the clothing.
That's the version you can wear the same clothing.
For an interesting reason, the velvet writhers over.
Oh, they're different characters.
You have access to the same wardrobe you can use, but they have different decoration


# REC029.txt
Let me give you something as close as we best have them.
Here's the same, okay, and let the neck, the butt, back, don't hurt.
You won't be able to wear it on while you're in class.
And add something to that.


# REC030.txt
So the play breaks out that stuff a lot, like, okay, so you had bad eyesight right here,
would you like to replace your eye?
Imagine that replacing your eyes.


# REC031.txt
Would you like to augment your mind?
Yes or no?
This would mean giving the player a UI.
If the player says no after rely on physical menus tomorrow, if the player says yes, no,
that's a memorable interface.
I don't know.
The menus are accessible to watch.
It's practical, right?
So then...
The end of a lens is a dry, I suppose.
I can count that lens.
Or earlier you had to belt it.
So what would you like in AIR display?


# REC032.txt
Would you like an air display, or would you prefer to use, analog, menus, analog, or would you prefer to rely on analog?


# REC033.txt
There are no UI elements, and the player has to sleep to save the game.


# REC034.txt
It's the idea, I can try to suppose they had a cream cover for the literature stuff.
Maybe a blanket of sorts.
No, I'm going to be up front and Bernie Sanders, that's where they're going to represent.
It's going to be perfectly centered around me and that Bernie's in there.
I think I was really interested in talking about him.


# REC035.txt
To battle!


# REC036.txt
So because the character dialogue system is filled with animation states and mind.


# REC037.txt
So because the character Tyler just must know the animation states in mind


# REC038.txt
Okay, so animation states, there's a timeline of interactions, and the character can be found
to also work in the world, going through interactions, it's an update to animation,
it's a play run to be here, this is the right shot, pretty much from the dialogue, and the
two out movement, and the movement turns into a dialogue or dialogue, but they have routines,
they have schedules, they take with their cycles, you can bridge off at any moment, in
another section to put things on, the characters that are out putting on the circumstances,
the point of conversation.


# REC039.txt
And so Mary and Cedric was the one I wanted to talk about.
And so what did I say to be?
I think.
Where's the closer?
Some things are rare.
Where's that sounds?
Most kids are grown, they drink a neck and they're too shunned, they drink a neck.
They're never sick of it.
They're different strengths.
A better life of the dreadful, beautiful, rare.
Everyone.

It's much difficult not to crawl this, there it is, it's much difficult, it's the hardest to get right.

Get some, please.
Are they bored?

Shhhhhh.
Hmm.
Is it perfectly?
Stride life's long as a little bit the same theme, but use different colors.
You get the different color options.
The lock goes in, now the lock will shut down for me.
The lock goes in, now the lock goes in, now the lock goes in.


# REC043.txt
So here's what I'm thinking, I have two forms of line tracks here, this one's more
of a pocket connector, and this has more of a, you put it in your pocket, it's a bit
of a pocket connector, so I'm actually not going to do any of that, I'm not going to do any
of that, I'm not going to do any of that, but it's going to be fun to collect. So imagine
that I'm going to do the same, same, same thing, yeah.
I'll show you what I'm going to do next.
I'm going to have to find the French, just leave it here.
Oh, and also provide a USB adapter that goes to USB.
I'm going to get rid of that voltage, and that's what I'm going to do in my mouth.
And that's what you're supposed to put in the other deck in.
That's what you're supposed to do.


# REC044.txt
So get the scene organized and put it all under one component, and I'll have that component
put the world over here.
Figure out where the player belongs there, where they'll be outside of it, inside of it.
And um, this type of chapters find a way to start talking about levels, but, uh, well,
I win.
Джоркс.


# REC045.txt
Or it reminds us of saying, get the feathers in the right positions, or move the place
or get theirs.
Figure out what's the best way to mind them on, and maybe lay the structure that is built
around.


# REC046.txt
So, I just happened to have this material, this beige material, and it's on the list
in there.
It's really good reporting.
So, they use it.
You can build the right percentage way.
It's robust, and they found all you need to combine it to build things.
It's to break pieces of this.
Break a small piece of crystal off.
A big crystal on it.
Plant it on a structure and it grows.
And then you can put more substrate around it and then it grows.
You can shape a structure.
This way.
The cities are almost finally a guess or so.

Considering that they would maximize the usage of that space, they would bolt up, right?

Recorder I can use but I need your consent to use it. So I mean recording up
So to speak to the best of my body in my mind as of now
No problem good to you. Yes, okay
Excuse me if I'll take my time with this place
I would say don't be afraid to get excited
That's a good tip so
Overall to no noise
I suppose that's what I'll begin
So imagine a space without cars without the distances we have to go
Imagine removing the sidewalks and building up
Utilizing the space we have the capacity to build higher
But when we do we build high rises that are disconnected, high rises that are
Ultimately separate from one another and hypothetically
If you're aware of the works of Palo Salary
An architect will work to build spaces intelligently, spaces that are built to encourage social interaction
Building trustness space to
Build and
We're so distant from other people usually it seems that it's hard to
Sometimes it's better to show not tell and at this point I
No, I can't get up with that stupid
Can I give you some tips just right off the bat?
Yeah, go ahead, it's fun
Always make sure to make sure
Repeat it over and over again
Continue repeating it until you can solidly push it
It follows into my other tip which is speak slower and with more confidence
Sound more like you're sure what you're doing like you're not improvising right as you're going on
Because if you don't know your own pitch and you're just winging it as you go they won't know as long as you're some confident about it
Yeah, good, good
Another thing I would offer
Practice your pitch
Pay attention to your facial expressions
If you look concerned or confused or lost
They're going to pick up on that
I need to learn how to pitch with the confidence
It's my facial expression
You know what?
The pitch is for like E3
Packs
Look at pay attention to how they're pitching
Look at their facial expressions
Look how they interact with the crowd
Like it
Yeah, okay, so let me


# REC056.txt
Act one more thing. Pretend your audience are a bunch of children that don't know what
you're talking about. Don't be afraid to use detail, but I don't wish to, but little
them. You're not belittling. No, trust me. I'm speaking with them. It's a conversation.
They ask for something to them. Yeah, it sounds like you think they're children. You
just start very excited about your idea and you want to get the point across. Yeah, that's
it. Okay. So, Dodeck is a third-person action-to-venture game. It's a, hmm, not hang on,
let me try it again. No, it's not action. Dodeck is a third-person exploration game built
on narrative interactions than PCs as you're exploring the space. You're using your hands
to traverse vertically in VR or in hypothetical. I can use both actually. I'm doing third-person
development and VR development, and it's very different. Remember to be calm and slow your


# REC057.txt
Huh?
Okay.
Dota could say,
third person narrative,
narrative entry game
said in the
Labyrinthine City of Grand Vos.
You begin in the space
set to explore with your legs.
You wander,
you navigate,
you interact with people
and you engage in conversation
and you engage in conversations.
You explore the space by hand,
you get to know it intimately.
If there's not most,
explore the
Toggies,
Labyrinthine City of Grand Vos,
the souls like
Metruvania like,
no, that's,
that's,
that's,
rain, come on then.


# REC058.txt
Yeah, it's good to get this out of your system now so that when you're actually pitching you'll have a more stable foundation for it.
Yeah, because you're gonna have multiple times it.
Yeah, thanks guys.
Appreciate this.
No rush.
Okay, I agree.
Any thoughts so far?
You're kind of...
You should define what space is a little better, because me, I've seen the images you sent me,
so I have an understanding of what it is a little better than somebody might not have that.
But isn't that part, should it be part of it though?
Yeah, if I can actually drop box, I can show you guys some building.
Can I have any of you?
Well, you have to get good at explaining it via words.
Ah, that's true.
The reasoning behind that is, again, it falls back to being able to communicate your thoughts in your head to others.
Those are my conditions.
Okay, so when I heard this space initially, my thought immediately went to outer space.
And then you set a space without cars, and then my brain was like, okay, this is a big flat plane.
Okay, well, define the space a little better.
I couldn't define the space for real quick.
Labyrinthine City was really good.
That gave me a very, very vivid image of this city that is just a fucking maze of buildings.
Okay.
So the Labyrinthine City of Grandfoss.
How's that part of this place?
I'm going to try it out.


# REC059.txt
Is this a fantasy setting? Is it a modern setting?
Okay. So...
Stand to explore the... No.
Explore the Lippin' Thine City of Grand Vos.
I suppose I can't really pitch it all again right now.
I want to explore the ideas that you're putting forth.
I can piece this together.
Yeah, that's fine.


# REC060.txt
Right down and like play it in the head like you're watching over recording. Oh, yeah. No, you're right. I will I will read it down when I want to get to it
So the question has to
The space itself
Paint the picture of what the city is like
With your words, okay, so
You know
Geon is an oceanic world
Set to rotate a artificial body
Geists make a structure
less by a civilization
Long-term to dust
No evidence of this legislation exists the organic matter is gone, but what persists are these
crystalline machines
Machines built through the process of evolution
What they believe to be the trillions of years
Oh, geez, that comes from swelling stuff. I can't
Not trillions billions. They know the world. They're not university 13. They're protected. I'm told
I'm told yours. Yeah, that works because that way when you go for the whole world just to lay it out
That way when you go for life of war
You can't have it learned or precisely in game is pretty good for us. So just to lay it out. Oh, geez
Okay, it's getting home time
Okay, so little look
Our universe is 13.8 billion years old. We are
About a flicker of light in the endless expansive space
Humanity has persisted around the sun
for
Not even that a speck of dust
We are we have been we are nothing in the cosmos
But that's okay
Despite our insignificance as a species we are
capable
So much more
We've got to build we've got to do things and in this time
300,000 years from the present day humanity has built
Carnage ships
And they've
catapulted themselves towards the stars the areas they've
To regions they believe is our habitat
for their life
And for life of their children one day now what's interesting here is in this world there's
Life extension technology
So you can live for as long as you need be and there are no consequences despite modern science fiction
Say not a wise I think that
We need more optimistic science fiction this fact that I'm I'm going into this with the thing that
They get here they travel 300,000 years. There's no light speed. They took 300,000 years to reach this planet
They know it intimately they've been sending probes and the probes have been building
They've they've never get the structure. They've they've explored it and they've actually built habitats
pre-made from distances
Imagine you design your habitat at home
We want you send it out to get developed in the planet
You won't see it for hundreds of thousands of years
But when you get there when you arrive, it's all built

Yons of centuries of

They've named the structures. They've named the space they know the space intimately
Imagine well, you see it over there, but we have technology. We've explored in the VR. We've used technology to
Explore space and in the same way we're doing here in the actual real world so I can
Do one one relation there. It's I want to encourage more

And that's how I do. I want a non-combat. You're exploring a third person

to like where it currently is,
because I imagine that would probably take
quite a bit of time if you were going to explain
the whole thing, but what my recommendation would be
is explain, but keep it clear and concise.
Like, don't, yeah, don't necessarily go into
a full depth of everything, but definitely give them
a clue about what's going on.
Clips, yeah, and don't stick to just the lore,
go into gameplay, go into like the exploration aspect.
You touched on like our insignificance is this
going to be like a cosmic horror type of game
or we're going to be able to explore space?
Like, those are the kinds of things that came to my mind
when I'm pitching it.
OK.
Basic concept of the lore.
OK.
Important gameplay functions and creatures.
Notable, interacting, basically.
A concept of the entities that you'll
be interacting with.
Do you have an idea of what demographic is going
to be more intuitive of it?
People know exactly what they're looking at when they see
this trailer, essentially, if that makes sense.
Are we going for something super realistic?
Are we going something for more imaginative
or artistic?
So Dota is a Dota beyond our home.
It's a hard science fiction narrative adventure game.
You're, OK, as I described before, you're exploring
the space, but it's filled to, oh jeez.
I think I'm going to call it the space again, hang on.
You're asking more in terms of gameplay, art direction,
other game direction, and other significant features,
OK.
So aesthetically, do you guys see Star Wars flowers?
What's the most recent one?
Like the three of them.
Yeah, they have that painterly aesthetic.
The character models, they're exaggerated,
but they're almost realistic.
It's a little, but it chose it because it's meant
to be life-production, right?
They're, it's affordable enough to produce.
And I think that if I can go that direction, if I'm
saying, if I want to speak, I need to speak to what I'm doing
when I want to do.
So if you guys hold it up, that's sort of long.
Come on.


# REC062.txt
Oh, you want to go inside?
Yeah, I'm going to go inside.
I'm standing here.
All right.
You want to show me?
No.
Well, maybe it's better to show not that you don't tell right?
What?
Show don't tell.
Is this a point where should don't tell us better?
Show gameplay, show environment?
No.
You still want me to describe it?
Okay, well.
The reason I'm thinking...
No, it's a good constraint.
I appreciate it.
Let's keep going.
If you feel like it.
Are you going to get into one plane?
It's going to drop temperature very low.
I'll be there right now.
Either way.
I need to get paid.
I need to get paid clocked up.
You want to try this place out?
No.
Cool.
Why don't you warm up for a bit?
Like, 15 minutes and then get home.
Because, like, if you don't,
you're going to be cold on the gas.
Hmm.
It's like a 20 to 30 minute wall.
I want to embrace the experience.
It's been a while since I've actually been cold.
I've been in my tent that I warm all the time.
Okay.
In plus, I'll be moving.
So, I don't want to warm up.
I think my problem now is that I'm just stationary.
If I'm running in place, that would be fine.
Be...

Today was a wonderful day, I got up late, of course, but I realized I had a much more
cost. It's a new word. And knowing I was not bad, it's bare. I walked. I talked to a lawyer
and I wanted to square things away and get my business rhetoric to change. He gave me directions.
He pointed me the right direction, I walked 40 minutes to the sale and the nearby building.
I talked to people there and they requested a TBA form and they said I need to set up a business in Nevada.
The thing is, I had difficulty doing this a lot earlier. I made the attempt, but it sectioned me off. It sent an email to me, but it didn't. It said it.
This whole situation was ridiculous. I was falling apart. I didn't want to do.
The lawyer I talked to earlier, I talked to him twice throughout the day. He was very kind, very genuine and helpful.
He put me in the right direction. I don't need to do business again. When I had the time, it didn't charge me for this time.
I think it understands that starting a business can be difficult to measure them into resources.
If it gets business, I'm running and he's got a client, which is great for him and that's fine for me because I need someone help me out.
I think I was, and he's great for his time.

making music, or I particularly did a rhythm, but I can't. I can't get back to it. It's gone.

but I'm fine. It's not a computer.

they're smaller structures, you break it down, and you find that everything in the world,
all there is cost effect, it's deterministic, and...
As long as I persist, I will continue to do things, I cannot do things.
I'm just not the better, I can reduce the time I spend, not doing anything.
I can't engage with these anymore, I'm so bored.
There's some good shows, but I am, but it's...
I've got to use TV for light learning, put on a good number of game-deferlated episodes,
game-deferlated, you've got the...
I just sit there and take notes and listen.
Yeah, that'd be good.
I can learn things.

to this work. Oh man, I haven't bought this much yet. Letters didn't know, fuck.

The quicks to discern when there is something is good or bad, but be sure to listen to the entire thing.
You don't have to record it, if it's not important.

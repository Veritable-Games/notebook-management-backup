Thoughts on Autumn.

1. Gameplay and exploration could be improved by including Metroidvania elements.
I need to find some youtube videos showcasing that game, perhaps another topic.
2. Models would benefit being higher poly with low poly textures.
Look at the model LN created for the ‘Little’ character. He used pixels for the texture.
3. I thought about it for a while. But I can’t really see the game not have in combat mechanics. So I suggest a basic Stealth system, combat based on dodging (no attacks) and a one hit kill mechanic to calm the animal. This was mainly inspired by Avatars airbending, based on Baguazhang style. A type of Kung fu that is based on defence, mobility and mainly avoidance of combat.
If Littlenorwegians can come to the next meeting, we can discuss #3 further.
4. I feel that the control of the seasons could be better implemented by making the power to change the season something that can be collected by rescuing a sister rather than having the ability change the season at any time. This is more where the Metroidvania idea comes in. This gives the players to explore levels they’ve previously visited and find new areas and puzzles they couldn’t before. It would create a sense of progression.
We had a tree stump in mind, like a button. However, it is still open for discussion.
5: Cinematics could be done in a style similar to Fire Emblem and Child of Light.
Colton had some ideas pertaining to this as well, post some references on Trello.

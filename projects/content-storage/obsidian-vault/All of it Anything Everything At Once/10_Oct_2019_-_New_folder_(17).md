In the back of my mind and conscious, in the back of my mind, I'm aware, you know?


# REC004.txt
in the back of my mind I have control, in the back of my mind I am aware, but neither of
these concepts are truly there, are nominally there, are consciousness and freewill or
nominal concepts. I don't know why I'm trying to rhyme it, just say it.


# REC005.txt
Nominally there. Nominally there.


# REC006.txt
The idea of free will is easy to debunk as opposed to speak against.


# REC007.txt
the idea of free will is easy to refute. Our universe is deterministic in
nature, therefore our behavior is deterministic in kind. The idea of consciousness
however is a little a little more to build the parts because we have a
bias against ourselves for ourselves. My cat is aware of his body, but he can
articulate about himself because he lacks language, he lacks


# REC008.txt
So my cat lacks the ability of language and the ability of introspection.

is our guilt-fried and shame unique to humans.
Probably not, but I'd like to know.


# REC010.txt
The brain is like an algorithmic search engine that pulls from multiple points
Imagine there's a search light and it's now beginning a space and
the connections that
Spotlight has are spread out throughout the brain
Not in a
traditional connection point sense, but more a
Neurons are firing and making connections to that particular process that particular event which stimuli

So it's loud, try to parse this, but just as science has types of sciences and philosophy
as types of philosophy.
And art has types of art.
Socialization, or in this category, whatever you want to call it, has types of civilization.
You want to call it.
Memes.
History.
Storytelling.
There are facets of human communication, that we typically don't consider to be a form of art.
Better to find these terms.
Communication should be regarded as a form of higher form of expression, I suppose,
and the ability to communicate is a skill highly reverberant, often under looked.


# REC012.txt
proper demonym. So I am a scientist, I am a philosopher, I am an artist, I am a
blank. Socialite, socially, socialite.


# REC015.txt
Points for the player can sit during climbing to either serve at the area or choose multiple directions.
Choose from multiple directions.


# REC016.txt
The moment, climbing moments to be used for introspection for the player.
So, use the triggers. Don't be afraid to use the triggers.
Triggers for group, triggers for grab, triggers for out and triggers for talk.
Aim for jump, you know.
X was x used for.
X for interact, I suppose, and be for sit.


# REC017.txt
Be for run, A for jump, and...
What? I'll pass it out.
Hmm.


# REC018.txt
Be the run, A to jump!


# REC019.txt
That sounds when the player moves, they build up heat.
They can't sweat like humans do, so what do you do?
You could release the heat through steam.
So imagine, as you're running, to expel the steam
and get them all on to rest, you press X to expel steam.
Make it satisfying, make it rewarding.
Like, wow, I did really well, we all had steam.
And if the better you are, it's climbing, maneuvering,
and navigating quickly, or, I don't know, find what we did.
Explore options.


# REC020.txt
doubles as a rest button.
So,
Hold X to release steam and there's no steam available, no steam built up,
you're walking around, there's no issue there, but if you're running,
both of steam anyway.
So, when there's no steam built up, nothing to release,
your character can rest.
The player might press X in and ringly,
and they'll sit down.
They will find the spot to look to relax in.
Oh my God, this is not a place to relax in.
Let's do it!


# REC022.txt
Designates the way the player loses X amount of water, X amount of steam, I mean, they can push further, but
they'll lose almost too much at a certain point, and they won't be able to traverse me farther without it.

# REC026.txt
find a canteen which they can use to restore their reserves from all exploring the space
into the reserves.


# REC027.txt
The player is in strictly humanoid.
They have a bird-like head.
Think of it as being an ergonomic human.
One of the awkward legs.
The more powerful legs you see on their organisms.
You know, the reverse new caps.
And then you have a...
That one weird, efficient machine without moving parts.
But it does move.
It bends in an efficient way.
Ah, it's called...
They have gifts of it.
Anyway, preferences.


# REC030.txt
So at first the player is just the first person and they're observing the environment and talking to people.
But then they get a buddy.
And then a buddy is a clunky cumbersome machine.
It's falling apart, breaking down.
Imperfect.
So it happens at some point.
The player feels the game is at the end.
They're kind of wrapping up with friends.


# REC031.txt
So this is scripted, but the player will explain to the player, but if they go near one of the many edges of the map,
their leg will give out.
School will lose.
NPCs have talked about fixing it earlier, they know it's dead, but y'all be fine.
All right, we'll fix you later.
To no follow the players on, the leg collapses.
They fall.
Leg is broken, all the leg gets destroyed.
You can use R2 and L2 to grab things.
You'll get run problems just to teach the player.
One successful grab.
And then they play on breaks.
And they keep falling.
And then another.


# REC032.txt
And it's after they've lost their last limb, they kind of give up, player thinks they're dead, they're gonna die.
But instead, something happens, and they suddenly grow a new limb. They grab, it's successful.
How do you give the player a body elegant name?
Reconsider this scene, and design it accordingly.


# REC033.txt
So they lose their metal form, and they grow a new one, and this new one lets them survive.
They're able to grapple onto her, and I'm sure all they're falling in, save themselves.
And it's in that moment that the player character looks at their body and comes to him, I guess.


# REC034.txt
In the moment before death, before the play believes they will die, they get two options,
like normal, two dialogue options, but these aren't words, they aren't spoken, they are felt internally, contentiveness and depression.
If you've never seen these symbols before, maybe they have, I don't know, could the symbols themselves convey enough information?
I'm working out, but if you choose depression, your character gets a blue tint, and if you choose contentiveness, your character gets a E cut.
Contentiveness would be Cosmic latte, and then if you choose neither, you get white, you get the neutral, I guess.


# REC035.txt
you never really see the moisture in the air until it gets foggy until the
dew in the morning collects on the windows

You can recover from heat exertion by resting or drinking water.

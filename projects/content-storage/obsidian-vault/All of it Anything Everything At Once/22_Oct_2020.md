Okay, try it again.
So there's a machine that stumbles into the homes to have a family, sometime in the
future. It's unknown to them, but it begins to make art of the span of years. They seek
to understand it, they critique the art, they criticize it, they counterfeel they better,
they better understand it and they're about to do so.
And they sell the art and the machine leaves.
And they explore the idea of ownership and possession.
So that's not where it's. It doesn't speak, but it does spend time looking at it's art.
It's just a matter of time, it's a matter of time, it's a matter of time, it's a matter of time.

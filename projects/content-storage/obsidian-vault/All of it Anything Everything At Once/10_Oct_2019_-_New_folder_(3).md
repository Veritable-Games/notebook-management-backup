5. Great opening lines. Now the quest for the perfect opening line may be as old as
humankind. Too often we lose an opportunity to meet someone because we spend precious
time trying to think of the perfect opening line. And there's no such thing. The good
news is there are a million perfect openers. There are a million perfect openers. What
do you say will depend upon who you are, the person to whom you are talking, the
circumstances, the response you want to get, and what pops up into your mind. It is far
better to say something than to wait for the perfect clever remark. Even if what you
say isn't going to change the world, don't lose the opportunity to begin a conversation.
Research now supports that experts, expert minglers, have always known the best opening
line of all may be a smile and a friendly high or hello. Okay that's very intuitive too.
Research now supports that expert minglers, what expert minglers have always known. The
best opening line of all may be a smile and a friendly high or hello. One opener that
has been suggested to me is, are you alone by choice or by chance? That will give you
a clue about how to proceed. Some other good areas in which to comment are the facility,
the food, the organization, sorry, some other good areas in which to comment are the facility,
the food, the organization, the traffic and parking dilemma, the guest of honor, the charity
community, or the charity community, community, that will benefit from the event. But what
will you actually do? What will you actually say? I always look to them, she says, I always
look to the magical three. So one is a statement. Look around the room, observe the situation,
what is happening? Does there seem to be a good crowd? Does there seem to be a good crowd?
Could they seem to be enjoying themselves? Or is the traffic or the parking difficult? What
do these people have in common? Observations about any of these things might be good conversation
starters. Saying something humorous or unexpected is even better. It's best to avoid negative
comments. We don't want to give the impression of being whiners. Avoid statements like, the
food looks pathetic. This hotel is far more rundown and that I had expected, typo, typo.
This hotel is far more rundown than I had expected. But don't be that guy. Go for an upbeat.
Don't go for an upbeat, unusual, go for upbeat, unusual observations that will peak people's
interest. Say on the positive, I think. Don't bring the negative. The negative doesn't
have. The negative doesn't forward any conversation. The negative doesn't forward any conversation.
You're getting a good loss in the weeds. If there's any, no, that's sorry, that's better
than that. Sorry, bed and turn of phrase. The negative is a distraction. It doesn't forward
the conversation. Literally. The only way to have any, best result is to be positive.
Say on the positive. To be optimistic in any given moment. And you would have good conversation.
Don't detract. Don't negate. So, okay, two, two, a question. The question is, the question
questions you should ask should be relevant. Do your homework and find out about the
group and the people who will be attending the event. Even if you don't know much about
the organization, you can ask questions like, you can ask questions like, are you a member
of this group? How would you suggest? How would you suggest I become involved? How do
you know that the bride, how do you know the bride, honey, honey, groom, a birthday boy,
anniversary couple, politics and et cetera? By questions, questions, questions, questions
should be an open-ended enough to encourage response. Here are some samples for various
events. So, the political fundraiser. What made you, what made you, oh my god, do, come
on, come on. What made you, what made you decide to support this candidate, to support
this candidate? How have you been involved in the campaign? Charity benefit. How did you
get involved with the March of Dimes, long association, et cetera? Okay, it's a pretty
intuitive, professional association banquet. Are you a member of this association? How have
you been active in your organization? Neighbors' daughter's wedding. How do you know the bride
are groom? How did you meet him or her? Jogging track. How often do you run here? How does
this compare to the other tracks you run? I met my friend, she says, I met my friend, Rick
Enos, through a question I asked at the Chamber of Commerce after hours at his Compadres,
Mexican bar and grill in San Francisco. I didn't realize that the guy carving the roast
beef, carving the roast beef was the owner, but I asked this stranger which sauce he would
recommend. No, I'm such a boring reader, dude. That one is the only grey poop on, pupe
on, pupe on master, mustard, mustard, pupe on mustard. That one is the only grey poop
on pupe on mustard, but this one is the barbecue sauce that is the house specialty, a guarantee
to put a sweat on your upper lip. Rick's sense of humor made me want to talk to him and
we became friends who are also part of one another's professional networks. A pleasant
self-relevation. Disclosing something by yourself is a good way to establish your vulnerability
and approachability, but there is a risk. Be careful not to reveal anything so personal
that it would burden the listener. So good openers. I don't believe it took me 45 minutes
to get here and I was the only, oh come on.


# REC002 (1).txt
I know.
All right, so this is really cool.
Let's see.
So give me a perspective on one person in the world.
Let's say a scientist, [...],
someone who has [incited] the initial curiosity [for] this planet.
Okay.
So you would have to imagine if those scientists knew this is someone
that has a pretty solid understanding of how things
probably will come at that point.
So they're understanding the atmosphere, the environment itself.
Yeah, you would have to guess.
The focus on that structure.
They probably have a pretty good understanding of the rest of it.
So it's interesting.
Okay, I didn't mention this, but there is a sphere hanging.
It's larger than the planet.
It's a sphere.
It's hanging in the orbit above the planet.
What's interesting about this is that the sphere is not dense enough to be a moon.
It's not dense enough to be a planet.
It's more like a moon in terms of density.
So it's a larger object.
The road takes the planet, but it's less dense.
Do they understand it is artificial?
They have investigated and they find that it's artificial.
They can't find the means inside the structure.
Another hypothesis here.
Another thing they might posit.
Or hell.
There could be a marking on there, but let me explain.
So this sphere is supposed to divide into,
and then take the ring world itself and attach to it.
And encapsulating the planet.
And enabling the ring world itself to ignite the engines.
So it's like an incubator that protects the planet as it moves.
Because despite space being so large, there is debris that could damage the planet [in] transit.
So it's meant to be both a housing for the energy,
all the energy that this thing is collected to use for power, use for fuel.
And then you have the interior of that structure that is supposed to be there.
So they don't know what the inside is at all?
They do not.
So there's a scientist you'd have to look at it like this.
You have two ports of the equation.
You have no way to figure out what the rubber is.
So what they would probably be doing is they would be attacking it from three ways.
One would be the logical way.
One would just be doing an analysis testing.
Anything that they could figure out.
And there would probably be anthropological studies.
There would probably be painstakingly study every inch of that [pillar] to see if there was even more [things there that they could use].
And the other one would be a smaller option because you said they're logical.
But you would have to imagine that some kind of religion would spring up.
Maybe not like they have a god but a spiritualism at most.
[Okay], that's interesting.
Actually it's a religion but it's not.
It's more of like not worshiping crystals but like under the idea.
They were worshiping the idea.
They were worshiping the potential for their civilization.
The guy I was working on before you came over,
I was looking at it like this that they viewed the pillars as a source of strength.
Because they look at it's [enduringness]
It's ability to just survive everything but still intact.
So they believe that the civilization, they believe that there was a civilization here but I got wiped out.
Well not necessarily that because they don't know if it's wiped out.
Because they felt no body, no signs of warfare.
[They just have a pillar]
So they are scientific about it and they're logical about it but they're also spiritual about the meaning.
Yeah because they don't exactly know.
So you have to imagine in that gap as well religious ideas [thrive].
That gap provides...[think of] the beginning of humanity.
We originally thought disease was caused by bad spirits or bad tumors in the body.
But as we learn, we filled in those gaps with [science],
And as we [filled it in with science], we looked to more and more gaps and put it there.
[...]
No, I completely agree with that.
So do you know the old cook, Delfi?
They found out the cave that she would bring all these people into.
The gasses make you high.
You'll hallucinate actually.
So they found out that just people would go into these caves, get high off this gas.
And think that they were having a spiritual thing of this old cook guiding.
Which intensifies the nature.
That's crazy.
But they also found a cave that is similar to, I believe it's the Greek version of hell.
And it emits a poisonous gas that kills anything that goes in it.
And they think that's what the tale of hell came from.
Because you know, they're underwater.
You go down a deep, dark cave endlessly.
And that's how you get to the underwater.
For them, this cave may as it could have been the entrance because of course they're not going to figure out.
You know, if you're dying at the entrance.
Like it kills everything in the land.
Animals, everything that they will look to it dies.
So that's how you could hypothetically, you could expand that hypothesis.
You could like, there are more details.
We need to keep searching.
We need to keep exploring.

[Leo had really cool imagry going on here: I see a series of intrepid explorers going into deep, unmapped caverns exposed on the suface of these pillars: celebrated, revered, but often going in, venturing to an ultimate demise, or lost to the stone forever]

Yeah.
Well, because if the logical, it's going to go two ways with this opening.
Either the species is going to benefit us, or this is a possible weapon.
Because like you said, it went in the bush.
Okay, let's say the extreme people.
We're of course going to be a minor enemy.
I think the overall, the society is built to be a little more optimistic, a little more communal.
You know, we're not as distrusting as people.
So we understand the idea of the existence of the paranormal.
Yeah.
So the paranormal is still there, but it's not as prevalent as it is in our society.
You know, it's like instead of the majority of people being the flat out there,
is there actually the people that know the earth is round?
So they move past the basic care of those of them, you can say.
Yeah.
They move past that.
[...]
And there's less, there's the lowest paranoia, less distrusting results.
Oh, trust you.
That reminds me of Shadeys.
Okay.
Did you see the full...
All four of these, yeah?
Oh, listen.
There's some of them.
Oh, there's some of them.
There's some of them listening to them.
Did you see this?
Is this the newest one?
These are the finals.
Well, the final eight of twelve.
So imagine balance and depression being in the center of the Dodecahedron
So we have pain and pleasure, aggression and fear,
elation and misery, desire and aversion.
And then these are all on...
These eight are on the sides of the twelve sided dodecahedron
Yeah.
And they're adjacent to each other with respect to their biological traits.
So say, for example, aggression, right?
In animals, the adjacent to that would be anxiety or fear, right?
Yeah.
But aggression in humans is also a tribute to one.
Hanger.
Yeah.
That's all it is.
Hanger is an abstraction of aggression and fear is an abstraction of anxiety.
And these are built in features and things like dogs, you know, we have for cats.
They express both of these things, except humans are very bad at attributing.
We attribute, like, it appropriately, like, the dogs.
Yeah.
Or the dog is scared, right?
But we don't attribute those exactly to us.
It's more of an abstraction to us.
We don't think for ourselves as animals, but we are, in fact, just biological.
So, elation and misery.
That's that.
What do you think those are attributed to?
So elation, not being happiness.
More like, look, look, look, look, it's weird, but it's weird.
And then it's like, you have the, the smile being a, I am not aggressive.
[It's more of a visual thing] (Leo says)
Yeah, it's a social thing.
It's a social survival skill.
The laughing is weird, but that's what I redo.
Misery.
So, what's interesting here is that this attribute is actually attributed to, what do you think?
It's sickness.
Yeah.
Believe it or not.
Sickness?
Sickness.
Or, like, imagine, you are in a sick state.
What do you feel like?
You feel like the symptoms there are analogous to depression.
It's, elation and misery are, elation is, aha, I'm not aggressive.
And misery is the crying, for example.
You know, that, that is like, okay, I am extremely anxious.
Like, there is a situation that is bothering me and I can't do anything about it.
I need help, I need social help.
The crying.
It's loud, right?
It's annoying.
It's not just, but, right.
You good?
Anyway.
You get, you get, I'm going in for a bit.
Yeah.
All right.
So, and then desire and immersion.
What do you think is attributed to?
The want, the need for something, the, the, the, okay.
So, it's not like, it's also attributed to sexual desire, I imagine.
But, the innate need for that, what do you think it is?
It's like, you're reaching out, you're grasping out, you're trying to get something.
We don't have a word for that.
It's want, but it's not want.
It's also innate in age.
I mean, so it's both, it's need and want.
This is why I'm using symbols, because these words are not directly attributed to...
[Yeah, you're going more for a more abstract look because words are very constrictive]
Yep.
You're right.
That's what I'm doing.
Okay.
So, aversion, that's that.
What do you think it is?
How much you guess here?
What's the opposite of it?
Aversion and desire.
So, imagine aversion being like, discussed.
I think it's not something I want.
Yeah.
But desire is something I want.
Probably.
Yeah.
You scratch your nose.
It's great then.
You know, it's like...
It's something close to the pain and pleasure.
Pain and pleasure.

(Leo suggests here that Aversion/Desire are very much aligned with Pain/Pleasure)

Yeah.
But it's also a facial response thought, right?
It's aggression is disgust.
I'm sorry, aversion is disgust.
Well, that's not a thing I've explained.
So, pain and pleasure, you know.
And that can be expressed in the face to a subtle degree.
But aggression and fear, those are very obvious, right?
In relation to misery, those are also fairly obvious.
Desiring aversion.
Those are a little more abstract.
We don't really overtly,
[Well, it depends on the person]
Yeah, we don't overtly say it or express it in the face.
We say it, we speak it, we don't show it.
This could probably be the whole thing to show.
So, this is why I think depression might be attributed to misery,
but it's not quite there.
It's more of an internal thing, actually.
It's not like...
It's like...
There is no outward expression.
You're neutral.
You have your facial expressions, right?
Most of the time, you never actually see someone in the neutral expression.
The moment you make eye contact with someone, there are subtle movements.
Yeah.
In the expression expressions.
Okay, so yeah, look at the side.
The one that develops a formulated response.
That's it.
So, depression and what do you think balance would be in this context?
So, it's interesting.
I think that balance is contentedness
Yeah, it's like...
[I know what you mean]
There's contentiveness itself, I think, is the idea would it be instead of being happy?
Being happy is exaggerated.
It emits morphings and stuff.
It's the more extreme.
You can't always be high on happiness.
I know.
You've got to be contentiveness is the way to go.
So, depression.
[It's just a severe lack of...]
Yeah, it's like the negative...version of that.
There's the...
Anyway.
So, you take all these.
You take these eight.
There's a few more we have to talk about.
Still, the pride.
And...
Pride and shame, right?
Yeah.
And there's also...
We talked about this too.
Empathy.
And enmity.
And enmity.
And enmity.
How do you say that?
I don't know.
E-N.
And then, E-M.
Empathy and enmity.
So, these are a little abstract.
And you help working through.
So empathy is the whole thing, dude.
It's whole to describe.
Because empathy is...
Very broad concept.
Think of it.
It was most both in sympathy.
You're either helping because it brings you some kind of internal pleasure.
You're helping because you feel a connection to that person.
Or you could even be helping because you feel like you could get something to benefit out of that.
[...]
That expresses the inward feeling, the expression we've had for that.
That empathy.
Empathy or empathy.
Think of it.
There's a facial expression for it.
Is there?
It's kind of like a smile.
I don't know.
Maybe.
I've never actually  seen anyone be visually empathetic.
It's more...
I think it's more internal.
It's an internal thought process.
Well, like for me, before I hope so...
You're an animal.
Before you hope, there's always that moment of you thinking, like...
How, am I able to do this?
What are the risks?
You always have that moment of pause.
Hmm.
[Don't you think people's faces shape into]
So, that's the initial moment.
That's the initial moment.
Because we've got to analyze...
It's like the bystander effect, right?
Yeah.
You're at the initial moment of pause.
But I think in the extreme willingness to act...
So say, for example, my cat is hurt, right?
My extreme empathy.
I'm going to jump right in.
I'm going to help right away because I care about that cat.
You know?
Yeah, but still...
That's the extreme...
Yeah, but still, even if it's the slightest micro-second
Your brain will, pause.
Hmm.
You're an animal.
Nothing's really automatic for people.
Yeah?
I mean...
When I game their videos, it's a micro of a second.
Your brain takes a moment to formulate that thought of how...
Because everyone is still calculated analysis of risks, benefits, relationships, and memory.
Yeah, I think you'd have to be [right about] that.
Because maybe that's why the bystander effect is [a thing]...
[...]


# REC00222.txt
I don't believe it took me 45 minutes to get here, and I was only 3 miles away, I don't
believe it took me 45 minutes, they're complaining, never mind, it never fails, I always managed
to get the teriyaki sauce on my Thai, I at least highlights the design, this food looks
so good, I am glad I forgot to eat lunch.
The first disclosures should be generally positive, generally positive.
Some time ago I attended a luncheon meeting, a luncheon, a luncheon meeting for a professional
association, and said hello to one of the officers, when I asked how he was, he mentioned
his separation, then he elaborated on his teenage children's questions about his love
life, and his sex life, and I realized that he needed to talk to someone, but that meeting
was neither the right time nor the right place, and I was not the right person.
Food is always a wonderful basis for communication, grandma knew that food was a great conversation
starter, that's one reason she made it, made lots of it, it's no accident that meetings
get together, social engagements, and family affairs are often centered around a meal,
when people come together over food, a certain amount of nurturing takes place, at least on
the physical level, and often at the mental and professional levels as well, you know,
flirting, flirting, and while we're on the subject of great lines, what about 30, what
about the words, body language, facial expressions and glances that can find their way from
a purely social situation to a business setting or vice versa, what about the words, body
language, facial expressions and glances that can find their way from a purely social situation
to a business setting or vice versa, to some, flirting is a way of exchanging friendly
banter, very much like small talk, good nature friendly banter is fine and can be appropriate
even in the office, to others, to others, flirting is a come-on and it depends on the flirty,
the flirty, the flirty and on what is actually, and on what is actually being said and done,
use caution, with flirting, use caution with flirting in a business setting, one person's
small talk is another person's come-on, ask yourself if you want that deal or that promotion,
writing on what, writing on what someone thinks of you as a business associate or as a potential
date, strategy 6.
Moving in, breaking and entering, there is a difference between including yourself and other
people's conversations and intruding on them, getting into a conversation that is already
underway requires a dose of shitspa but also some sensitivity, watch people's body language
and listen to the tone of their conversation for clues, one of my clients offers this advice
for including without intruding, avoid approaching two people who look as though they are having
an intense conversation, if they seem, if they seem totally preoccupied, you can assume
that they are flirting with some profound ideas or with one another.
Approach groups of three or more, position yourself close to the group, give only facial
feedback to the comment being made, when you feel yourself being included, either by verbal
acknowledgement or by eye contact, you are free to join in the conversation.
Be open to others who want in, when you see someone on the periphery of your conversational
group, remember how uncomfortable you feel in that situation, that's good, that's very
good.
If you merely want to extend, if you merely want to extend a greeting to someone in the
conversation, you might say, excuse me for interrupting, but I wanted to say hello,
then move away, you may find that your interruption is a welcome relief and that you are invited
to stay in chat.
If you merely want to extend a greeting to someone in the conversation, you might say, excuse
me for interrupting, but I wanted to say hello, then move away, you may find that your
interruption is a welcome relief and that you are invited to stay in chat.
What if someone interrupts your intents or inborn conversation?
According to Dr. Geraldine Alpert, a psychologist in Marion County, North of San Francisco, you
can be both firm, you can be both firm and gracious, acknowledge the person politely
and thank them for saying hello, indicate that you need to finish this conversation, but
we'll catch up with them later, then do so.
Strategy 7, moving on, extricating yourself, many of us feel uncomfortable,
with ending a conversation, someone, somewhere, told us that it was rude, actually, the etiquette
of cocktail parties is that we are supposed to circulate.
No less than authority then mismanners suggest that we spend no more than 8-10 minutes with
anyone person.
We have been invited so that we can mingle and meet other attendees.
It is an opportunity to circulate among peers, colleagues, potential clients, and to meet
as many people as possible.
The idea is not to engage in conversation with one person for the duration, although
we sometimes do that because it can be easier.
So that's good, 8-10 minutes, that's great, that's a good goal.
Now today it's more like 4 minutes, can I have 4 minutes your time to talk on things,
not 10 minutes, it's too much, 4 minutes is probably a good time because if it turns out
that I'm talking to you, they'll talk to you more.
If you wanted to get to know everybody on a school campus, you wanted to get to know everyone
in your office, you wanted to get to know everyone in your factory, if you wanted to
unionize.
Can I talk to you for 4 minutes?
We might have alignment on things you'd be surprised about.
It turns out we're actually pretty similar, 70-some percent of people would not want to
see, but the Democrats really think it's general consensus that we don't want to see
Biden run again, it's not going to be you.
We got a Marianne Williamson, Marianne Williamson will save us, Marianne Williamson,
Marianne Williamson, say your name, say your name, so, yeah, thank you, I'll fetch
right that, Marianne, Marianne Williamson, Marianne Williamson,
Marianne Williamson, Marianne Williamson, Marianne Williamson, Marianne Williamson,


# REC002-technology.nature.txt
If being a hippie is extreme and being normal is the norm, the average, then is there a
median for having both a connection to nature and a connected to a connection to a connection
to technology? Well, I need to write it down instead of, yeah.


# REC003 (1).txt
Goal now, what do you mean, goal?
Okay, so for the character themselves or the overall goal, it's just that you'll go to the society because
Like it depends on what kind of take that you want if you want if from this the everyday judge you're over

Okay, so I think that
No, go for a minute. Yeah

We need less windows and more porches wide open areas where you can also take in your surroundings in a semi-isolated environment.
The portrait right now is low to the ground. It's isolated. It's very private, I suppose.
I think there's a middle ground to that. There's a moderate amount of privacy, but not so much that it's entirely isolating.

Okay, so the graceful exit, how to make a graceful exit.
I once found myself talking for 20 minutes to someone who's company, I didn't find
particularly pleasant, particularly pleasant or stimulating.
When the colleague I was with asked why I had done that, I am in a hard and said I hadn't
wanted to be rude.
Susan, he said, why didn't you just say, just say, excuse me, that's all it takes.
Even Miss Manners agree, her idea to be a perfect exit line, her idea of a perfect
exit line, excuse me, it's been lovely talking to you, I don't like to lie, so I occasionally
find myself substituting, excuse me, it's been interesting to talk to you, but the
principle is the same.
To make your exit easier, wait until you have finished a comment, then smile and say, excuse
me, it was nice meeting you.
If it makes you feel more comfortable, you might add, I think I see my boss, client,
partner, spouse, mother-in-law, the old, I need to freshen my drink, line has its drawbacks
because theoretically, theoretically you should ask others if they would like their drinks
freshen.
Then you not only have to return, but you've brought them a drink.
Once you extricate yourself, visibly move to another part of the room, to the room.
It underscores, this underscores the fact that you really did have someone to see or something
to do, and that you didn't leave that person simply because you were bored.
Before you leave the event, be sure to thank the host or hostess, even if it's a trade
association, luncheon, rather than a social dinner party.
Someone is in charge and has spent time planning the food, the program, and all the details
of the event.
Take that person out and thank him or her, beware of the time consuming, draining 30-minute
departure in which you have to say goodbye over and over again.
Begin short conversations, say goodbye again, and slowly, painfully, answer yourself towards
the door.
Ron Owens, a San Francisco radio talk show host suggests that when you are ready to leave,

What keeps the everyday going?
So what is their interpersonal motivation?
They're...they're...they're...
So you've given them a goal. The goal is to figure out what's in the town.
The overall goal of this, yeah.
But I mean, it's one of a background goal.
I'd say it's like...
There's the...
Now I'm going to say the individual, but the collective goal as a society.
Because they're not just going to be about that.
I tell you, they're going to be trying to develop themselves.
The collective goal would be to salvage for technology.
To advance to a level that this society, this precursor society,
this not really precursor, but the weirdly ancestors of this society.
It's not quite ancestors, though, because of the behind.
It's not ahead thereafter.
Not before.
So now we've known that a lot of people would probably...
That should be a higher sense of duty to what they're doing,
which is probably sacrifice more for it.
So I want to...without spoiling it.
I mean, I guess I'm not very spoiled if you didn't mind.
But um...
Yeah, I don't care.
Yeah, you're right.
And you need the context to actually make sense of this.
So I shouldn't be worried about spoiling it with you.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, of course not.
I mean, even if you didn't...
I mean, it's not a huge deal. It just sucks.
Because that'd be less...
Less interesting if people are new to the exact hypothesis.
Or the precise theory.
Anyway.
Um...
So...
Imagine you look out in the light sky from these pillars, these structures.
You see that?
Yeah.
You saw the um...
Just uh...
Emphasize that.
That is developed.
So he's going to make this structure more porous.
So imagine that this is one foundation of the structure.
Let me show you the actual uh...
Information here.
So it's like um...
Uh-huh.
Okay.
So here's what he sent me.
He sent me this piece here.
And this piece.
Is they looking above?
And there's the internal piece.
You can see the outline of human.
Yeah.
Alright, it's on the ground.
Yeah, okay.
So he's going to make...
Add this section here.
It's going to be where it is.
This is the perspective I have.
You know, from this angle here?
Yeah.
You're looking up to this.
Okay.
From this angle here.
You know, this area here, right down here.
You're over here.
So it's still very open.
And he'll put more spacing between the roof
and the ceiling so you can see through it.
It'll be more like a um...
A web.
Yeah, I see that in the diagram.
Yeah.
Okay.
This kind of gives us right here.
So environment is also very important to...
I hope you put it out.
We found that...
The think of isolated tribes.
Voices.
Countries that are very open.
So for an isolated tribe,
any contact with someone out of that group
is immediate cause for ILO violence?
Well, they retreat.
Right.
Because they're outside because they're separate.
If you interlinked...
If you successfully interlinked communities.
Like I say, I'd imagine it sounds bizarre,
but the peasant community is back in community with ILO.
That's pretty good.
We're a lot more close-knit.
Yeah, they would help each other.
Relative in our case.
Yeah.
But um...
It's more about...
Imagine the society, right?
There's no cars.
There's no extreme divisions between people.
And we have these interlocking spaces.
You have public transportation.
You have subways.
We are close.
We're going to figure out something.
Of course.
But then you have the...
The internal society itself.
And they're...
They're socializing.
They're close.
They're close-knit.
People...
You know everyone around you.
You know your neighbors.
There are communal spaces designed to...
It's very social.
Yeah, yeah.
It's like...
This is going to sound bizarre.
But imagine...
Japan, right?
You have the...
The public path houses.
Yeah.
They have the...
Yeah, they're very social.
It's like this is...
To them...
It's a...
See...
It's just a way of life.
Yeah, yeah.
It's like...
Imagine...
What other...
So the biggest thing about that is...
Bar...
Pups.
You know, it's like...
What else are we going to do?
Yeah, they're like a designated spot.
I know what you're getting at.
They're like a community spot.
So the biggest difference between us and Japan is...
There's a so-and-level of prodigious that is tied to...
Americans are generally more prudent about sexuality.
They're going to have a cultural and more typical...
Oh, yeah.
No, no, no, no.
It's more taboo in the violence.
Yeah.
So...
You kind of have to figure out...
Your society stands on these.
Because...
These are going to be...
Really big motivators for you.
The characters.
I do think sexuality should be a lot more open...
than it used to be.
Because it's like a...
It's a question of society, I think...
That taboo divides people.
Again, because...
Because it's like...
The social aspect of...
That's...
Those...
That group of stomachs, right?
Well, like...
They don't have...
They don't seem to really have a gender.
Because...
No, it's like...
They must have a female in their back.
Right.
It's an entirely social...
It's like...
Yeah, just an aspect of...
So...
How do you vote of...
So, you know, chimpanzees...
There was a female version of them...
Across.
Well, they actually...
Sex is a way of...
Shredding communication.
Huh.
They'll call it like bannabos or something?
They'll encounter the peaceful.
They don't have violence.
They won't fight.
They typically just fuck it out.
Damn.
It's mainly female-ran.
It's a matriarchy.
Hmm.
They don't really go to war.
They just help each other.
They're very empathetic from monkeys.
I think that might be like...
Maybe an extreme utopia?
In that sense, there's no violence whatsoever.
No, they still have violence.
But typically, the way that they solve it is...
From sex.
It's not really like physical violence.
Hmm.
If they have an argument, the monkeys will fight.
But eventually, they use sex.
And it means to come back together.
So, what's interesting is that I'm...
I'm kind of going in the direction of there being...
No extreme amount of violence.
But I do think conflict still arises.
I do think there is still a level of aggression...
Humanity.
Well, that's not humanism.
That's tried monkeys.
But typically, the way that they solve it is...
They're the spit-off in the group.
Well, the group just actually has...
So, I'll come in together and then they use that way to dispel it.
Hmm.
That's really...
I mean, it's a Jason...
You're...
You're removing anxiety from the situation.
That makes sense.
If you're really...
I don't know how that works.
Oh, okay.
Back to enmity and empathy.
Yeah.
What do you think?
What do your thoughts now?
Because we've talked about it for a while.
So, it's like...
Okay, so, okay.
That's what's an easier one.
Let's go with enmity.
Let's go with distrust.
What do you feel in a situation?
How do you feel towards someone or something or...
Something...
Or a situation, I should say.
You distrust roller coasters, for example.
You know, it's like a...
To be either anxiety...
Well, it's time anxiety, I think, that a lot of these things are.
But I don't think it is the distrust in and of itself.
Because, remember, words don't do it.
It's the distrust factor of fear of heights,
and the distrust factor of humanity,
or people in general, that links to one initial behavior, I believe.
It's like...
They're both tied to the same effect,
and you have varying degrees of, let's say, for example,
fear or anxiety,
and outward aggression.
So, it's like you're balancing those.
This is the variable here.
This is the common denominator.
So, typically, when people...
Distrust, they will tend to cross the arms.
They close themselves up.
That's a little bit of...
I mean, you're right.
It can be expressed in a way, but...
Okay, so, imagine.
Right?
You know, I'm just relaxing, I really...
I don't think the cross-arms...
No, it's not.
But those are very big differences,
because I'm being cross-armed.
And then...
No, I think...
What's interesting is that...
Because you're doing this...
When you're standing, you're not on guard.
You're not, like, ready to fight.
Remember that...
Well, back to your spine, this.
But a posture has a lot to do with that kind of thing.
So, imagine you're standing in a space.
Usually, you don't want to have...
You have your arms like...
You're talking to someone.
You don't have your arm dangling around.
So, you do.
That's...
Well, so, think of it like this.
When you distrust something,
you tend to put your weight back.
Like, you tend to grab it yourself in a position.
Like, when you wouldn't do...
Put your hands on your back,
because you have a distrust.
Typically, people are like,
keep their hands out of the front of their sides.
How would you express that socially?
So, like...
Well, think of, like,
when...
Have you ever seen videos of people where before fight?
Like, before fight, it's visible.
Simply, people are idle.
Some people do this.
Some, like,
raise their arms.
You just...
If you distrust something,
your body kind of naturally...
So, it's like, like...
Well, it may be necessary when you do this.
But there's a difference between doing this
when you're paying attention.
And doing this,
when you, like,
you want out of something.
Because the issue you're trying to explain is...
There's a kind of an unspoken
communication between people.
This is body language,
but in what...
To what degree is it explained, though?
So, it's kind of, like,
vibes almost.
It's a terrible way to describe it.
Well, as opposed to...
How would you get proxiation,
I have to do it.
How would you get an accurate display of vibes?
That's the thing.
Don't...
A combination of factors.
It's like, the stems.
Body language.
Well, I think that...
Okay.
Could...
New, for example,
simulate the...
The vibes,
given off.
No, it's...
It's like...
It's like...
Okay, just...
Yeah, I think...
Yeah, I think so.
You can't fake solid emotions.
You can...
Describe them.
You can emulate them,
but ultimately...
It's...
It's kind of like trying to describe something
to someone that they haven't seen.
Okay, try to...
Okay, let me try to show you this.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I have to try to...
I can't see.
Okay.
Right.
It's like...
We can't probably express this.
We know it's there, but it's so complex.
And let me show you this.
It's a reference I found
looking for actual research in this.
I know what you're talking about.
I know what you're talking about.
I know what you're talking about.
I'm actually...
It's very, I mean,
hard state school,
lots and lots of undergrads.
Yeah, but...
You're being done tough.
That's really why I have to write this.
I know that you feel...
I think that's...
You did a breakdown of the conversations.
You should really look great.
You know...
Watch it.
I mean, I understand that.
Like, the nights we think of...
No, I don't know who they...
I don't know who they...
I don't know who they...
I feel so...
I feel so...
I feel so...
I feel so...
So they...
To respond socially to smile...
Oh, how lapsed I have.
You just hand me over.
I'm talking to everyone.
That's, again, the thing.
I think it's emotional.
I think it's emotional.
It's something to be expressed for me.
Yes.
And they're very important to that socially.
Yeah, but that's really good on corporate now.
Anyway, I've got to get more recording
of natural conversation, I think,
because you're right.
I don't think we can fully explain it
just by doing it.
I think there are some aspects there
that aren't fully expressed.
Oh, another thing is, is like...
I think that if you put two people in a space, two people in a small space, you can't
put two people in a small, enclosed space, not like to a comfortable degree, to where they can freely
hold their own careers or socialize. So, no books, they're just waiting there and they can see a clock,
you know, time is ticking away, they can do nothing or they can talk, they can communicate.
Well, no, it's not like necessarily a choice, it's more about...
No, I mean, it's like you give them the consent, you tell them they have a recording.
Yeah, see this, them going is unconsciously going to be stripped.
Well, that said, like you and I being behavior, being behavior oriented, being humans,
being biological machines, even if you record knowingly recorded conversations,
you can still find genuine socialization.
No, but it's just like... So, those, like when a conversation isn't recorded,
there's more of a rhythm to it that you won't find, because people won't scale the topic.
Let me show you this. You're right, you know, there is a rhythm.
I know we did the water analysis.
No, that's not the word analysis, there's one more, how where is it at?
I don't think I'm sure.
When people are recorded, at least for me, I tend to watch what we say,
I tend to think more about what I'm about to speak.
Fair enough.
Because people realize those consequences, so maybe not, and I say that person putting it out,
the thing of videos that have come out, or even things that have been tweeted out,
that years later have come down the road.
I think that has installed a quote really, that people are more scared to talk freely
than they know if there's something listening.
I'm just trusting.
Why am I just trusting?
Just paranoid, because we've seen how long this callback calls for those.
You know, people that fall back at the 60 years ago didn't hit by shit.
And I think, oh, the last couple of them.
I think you could...
Do you think you might correlate that with being close to...
Less and less close?
Do you think it's like, you know, we're starting to build roads,
we're starting to have more densities with less social spaces?
I mean, you could, but at the same time,
it's kind of hard to figure out, is it that?
Or is it just because we're going through these shifts,
or we're not really keeping up?
I think it's kind of mixed up both.
I mean, it's slightly different.
This little was like,
40 years ago, even,
phones were typically stuck to landlines.
They weren't able to go everywhere,
so information was still slow with the spread.
So people would tend to, like,
just come together naturally.
But now that you have this opening of everything,
as possible,
I think it gives some people social paralysis.
I think of, like, social anxiety.
We still had it back then.
But those kind of understanding, like,
look, these are kind of the people you're stuck with.
So deal with it.
Kind of like what you suggest, take the room,
lift them up to people,
or you only give them an option to talk.
And then we're entertaining back then,
wasn't as refined as typically live events.
The recordings weren't really a big thing.
So people were more social back then,
because they didn't really have a choice.
They would do that, or be by yourself.
But as we've gone more and more on technology,
people realize there's more choice.
That's an interesting tangent.
Okay, so in that regard, how do you get people to socialize?
Even if technology is a little thing.
Okay, so imagine the screen, right?
This is where people spend their time.
Once you have a screen that's not,
you don't give it a technology, right?
You put it on the side of the right.
You know, imagine that they can do this.
But also in front of them, it's also people.
It's like, so conversation can sometimes arise.
It's not too frequent.
And it depends on how close you are to them.
But typically strangers in a social space,
they have no incentive to communicate.
Think about a bus or a shuttle,
so you have to encourage more social space
in a shared area.
So imagine you're walking around like a city block.
Like a city block, even smaller than that.
Like a tribe or a town.
You know, a small...
Everyone knows everyone.
Yeah.
It's to the point where there is a very low level of
crime in these kind of areas.
And because these areas are accumulated everywhere,
you know, small social spaces that are optimal for communication,
crime rates across the entire structure is minimal.
They're still exist.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
You can do that.
Yeah.
Even if it is a scarcity-free society.
It's a scarcity-free society.
It happens.
The scarcity isn't that crime.
It happens to be an emergency response.
I don't know what you saw, but it was damn cool.
Imagine it's been a social situation.
You're kind of going through a twist and turns.
I didn't write notes, I didn't write beats.
I didn't write notes, I didn't write beats.
I didn't write notes, I didn't write beats.
I didn't write notes, I didn't write beats.
That's right, that's the time to sit down and die.
I didn't write notes, I didn't write beats.
I didn't write notes, I didn't write beats.
I didn't write notes, I didn't write beats.
What is the best out of it?
mess up once anyway here's what I'm trying to do now if I can go back to the beginning
or the current I should say it's gonna seem weird yeah but um this is actually
the campfire well straight up.
Frag this one.
ATTACK!
IT'S A BIND!
ATTACK!
ATTACK!
YOU DON'T KIDGE!
IT'S A WEDDING INSTACED!
IT'S TALKING THIS POSITION!
IT'S TONGUE AS YOU KIDGE!
IT'S A WEDDING INSTACED!
IT'S TALKING THIS POSITION!
YOU BALL IN STERIC!
ATTACK!
ATTACK!
MONSTER KILL!
So that last bit there the attack attack it's like uh you're going back and forth you're
conversing you're uh in some some first can have that conversation you know okay today
do you think I got a final references?
I'm trying to condense him here but I tell the figure by that one.
Anyway so imagine you have the big name of a conversation and you have branches and
they branch for maximum two times this is not entirely accurate but they branch for
maximum two times you have R2L2 and this is how you're conversing here.
R2, R2, R2, R2, R2, R2, R2, R2, R2.
So there's a skill base there.
It's more or less an emulation of natural conversation.
So you could be skilled to it.
You have to really pay attention to listening yet to be actively engaged actually.
What's not quite a good treatment?
It's like a new, if you stop conversing, you don't have to hold it.
And what happens if a hard chew to communicate, healthy to communicate,
but if you hold R2, you're talking, you're talking, you're talking, then someone talks.
Okay, you can press R2 again to persist, like I'm going to keep talking.
Or someone jumps in and they, you let them talk.
Right? Like you can, you can just...
and let someone communicate, right?
It's not necessarily a quick time of minutes, we're like, a...
an option to communicate.
Okay, so it's really a traditional call.
Yeah, it's like a more natural conversation.
You can continue going to tangent or going on, but sometimes it's like a different,
interested or...
Yeah, very often sometimes.
You have to find out the appropriate tangent.
The one that keeps driving, I guess.
For as long as they're able to talk about it.
Or as long as I can design them and talk about it, I should say,
because I got to be careful about scope.
Anyway.
Oh, geez.
I'm sorry, there was a lot of tangents.
When were you last?
I mean.
For the side.
Edmity and...
Oh, go ahead, yeah.
So.
Design to...
That's one perspective, one person.
What do you think?
Also, you will...
Have you decided if the pills have meaning?
So that's going to be a big impact.
So I'd say the...
You mean...
In the perspective of designers and the perspective of the society?
For the society.
Like, do these pills mean anything to them?
Or is it just a challenge?
Do they draw...
Do they look at these pills and think of...
Like, when I was saying, for example, I used the pillows as an example of strength
because of their dirtyness.
They've been, though, since a civilization has stored it.
And they've slowly built up in the shadow of this thing.
And that whole time these pills have stood.
Well, I think that in and of itself is probably a good meaning.
It's a good attributed meaning to these, what they might believe.
Yeah, but do they?
That's the question.
Well, I think maybe not the majority.
But this is like...
It's like saying a small majority.
Or not knowing that.
Maybe it's a good amount of people.
No, this is not religion.
It's more like spirituality.
It's symbolism.
Yeah, symbolism.
There you go.
So, imagine that.
It's like the United States flag.
People look at it and some people are like, that's America.
That means everything to me.
And then people look at it as a flag.
But there's...
I think there's also the people that look at it philosophically.
This is what my country represents.
This is what my action represents.
I am with this group.
There is a kind of flag.
It has 13 sites for the original 13 colonies and 50 stores.
It was 51, I can't remember.
We'll put each state.
Like each flag, if you break it down, has history.
Like the Mexican flag.
White is what peace.
Green is for prosperity.
And red is for the blood of materials.
The eagle represents the eagle that landed on the cactus.
That the priest saw that decided this is Mexico.
Because he had a vision that no promised land would be.
Well, a signal by an eagle holding a snake in its clots sitting on the cactus.
According to the legend, he led his people through South America.
And they wanted to stop because how beautiful and green it was.
But he said no.
And he posted a view of them.
Convince some of them to keep going with him.
And the way that they chose Mexico to see the symbol of the eagle of the snake on the cactus.
And that's why the eagle is on the flag.
Because for them, that was literally the moment that God gave him the sign.
This is your land.
So what kind of symbolism could we use here to convey a flag, for example?
Well, it's a thing they could even use the pillow.
They could literally just use that pillow as the flag.
They could look at it as a symbol of strength for the people.
Because you said they'd think that this is a higher society.
That they were trying to bring themselves to the level that this society was at.
Okay, so imagine like this being thicket there.
And this is now, they accomplished their ancestral goals.
Now they're working for their own goals.
This is my goal, my personal ambition.
We made it.
Yeah, we made it.
Everyone did more.
Like you said, they look at it like a challenge.
They want to get inside.
So maybe not necessarily it's driven by a scrap or the need for technology.
Maybe they view it as like a test at this point.
They look at this pillow like maybe because you said the logical.
So maybe they think that this is like a test because you said they've decided it's not a weapon.
Then yeah, they think it's a test.
They think it's a bit into it that it's not a weapon, not a device for destruction.
So they think that's a really good idea.
Okay, so imagine it like this is humanity's test.
If we can accomplish this, then we can join the species.
This race.
Wait a minute.
They're going to give meaning to this mysterious object that has been there since the storm.
So of course it's going to be the, it's just tech.
It's just a rather consistent scrap.
It's just been left.
But if you're people in a hopeful people logic of people like you said,
they're not going to aspire a higher meaning.
Maybe once we get in this pill, the species will show itself.
Maybe this is their test for us to decide that we're able to fully communicate.
Well, because I watched the show on the premise was a crystal-rounded grip.
Did not communicate with us at all for months.
One of the scientists viewed it as a test that the civilization wouldn't speak to us
until we knew how to talk to it.
And what was the outcome of that show?
That premise, that film?
It was that it was a weapon.
But not like how you're thinking.
They would send this in and in the show, it was literally just a crystal.
They figured out that playing music to it made it work.
And it took them months upon months to figure out that it wasn't the music,
but what it wasn't sending back.
Because it was sending back broken bits of the song.
And when you figured that out, it opened.
No, the crystal's not important.
What it opened to, what it was in?
As a thing, they never explained.
They always showed it as a darkened interior.
Darkened interior?
Okay, so it hints towards more.
But that's it. That's where it ended.
Well, so the crystal was in the main store of the show.
That was literally just the store of it.
Oh, well.
And then this expedition to figure out what it came from.
And that was how it tied back.
It was the crystal that's owned out.
It was a weapon from the civilization.
What it does is it sends out these things.
And if something interacts with the crystal, it realizes it's knowledgeable.
And if it cracks the crystal, it's code.
They realize, okay, we take over the resource to take this planet.
And that's the negative twist.
Okay, so I'm okay.
But you don't have to have that negative.
Okay, we can have it.
I can think it's a test.
It is a test.
And it is fact.
It's not.
Maybe it is a test.
No, no, it's not actually.
It's not a test.
It's just dormant.
Yeah, but we sure know that.
This is what they aspire to it.
Maybe they think that they've been chosen because they have that.
You said they have the strew above them.
That obviously isn't me.
It's not missing actually.
Then they have a pill.
Maybe they think that accessing the pill is the test that opens the portal.
It opens that spear.
Because he said they haven't reached the spear themselves yet.
The spear?
What did you say?
The...
They haven't gone inside of yet.
Yeah.
I haven't reached it.
Yeah, that less pillar.
They haven't gone inside of yet.
But I think the spear that's following above them.
The spear?
Oh, the spear.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
They haven't not reached inside through yet.
But they haven't reached the outside.
They have.
They have expected range.
They've landed successfully.
So maybe they think it's like a lock and a key.
Maybe they think in order to get into the spear, they need to use the tower.
Ooh.
Maybe they could be completely wrong.
But that's the point.
It's just a theory.
Yeah.
I love that though.
It's like in reality.
They think...
Okay.
They think it's a key.
And they think it's a lock and a test.
They think it's a lock and a test.
They think it's a lock and a test.
Like, if we can get the structure and calculate the planet, we can go see...
We don't even know what does that.
Right.
Maybe they think that inside the tower is a way inside the spear or a way to communicate it.
But the...
The planet has engines, right?
The ring world has engines.
You know, what if...
What if the spear had engines and the ring world is the ring world?
Aha!
So it's like that way...
This thing eventually attaches the engines.
So the engines are attached to the outside of it and they encapsulate the ring world.
What do they realize it's engines?
Or would the tech be too advanced to realize it's an engine?
What else could they think it'd be?
Well, that's the thing they don't know.
What do they mean?
It looks like engines.
And people believe it would be engines.
That doesn't necessarily make it an engine.
So, think of the Indians.
They force out guns.
They call them thunder cannons.
Do you...
They thought it was mystical weapons brought to them by the gods.
That's cool.
Okay, so imagine...
This...
Imagine the structure.
Imagine this...
This thing it has like...
This is...
It's puts off in the four parts.
Yeah.
Right?
You have the...
So it pops off here and attaches the engine to this side, the engine to this side,
and then it...
It kind of connects to the ring world itself.
Like, imagine it connecting to the inner piece of this, you know?
Yeah.
Anyway.
And imagine the engines being outside of that.
Now, what if it looked more like a cannon?
More like a multi-tiered cannon?
What if they believed that each of these was a...
Projectile device?
Like a...
Yeah.
Like planetary defense.
Yeah.
If I was planetary defense.
But in reality...
It's not that.
Exactly.
So that's the thing.
It's humans and they don't have an answer.
We'll make something about it because they don't like not knowing.
Because...
That's one of our downforce.
If we don't have an answer, we make one up because it's better to have a fake answer than it would be.
And what's happening?
Knowing humanity, they believe it's a weapon.
Instead of actually what it is, it's...
Oh, yes.
And then...
Maybe they don't believe it's after them because he said, do not...
It's apparent that maybe they believe that this society built this tower and then built a defense system.
And that explains why they're gone.
Because they attribute that this weapon meant war.
So maybe they left the planet and this is what they left behind.
And maybe they think that by getting into the tower, they can activate the weapon.
Or learn about why they left.
Oh, do it just perfect.
Because you could aspire even a fake enemy that doesn't even exist.
Yeah.
Because then that gives every member of the society a reason to be poor or the collective.
Manate is best when there's an enemy.
Well, it's not just an enemy, right?
They believe the civilization we've had, they believe we've been long gone.
But...
So that's the thing.
If those are the defense system, those are obviously an aggressive.
So that civilization might be gone.
The enemy...
I think it's out there that they know about.
They think...
Because you said they thought the civilization was wiped out by war possibly.
That's one of the theories they have.
So if the civilization no product built this, you have to imagine the civilization that may be attacked.
Them in no minds would have to be greater or equal.
And maybe that's why there's no remaining obstructions.
Maybe that's the only thing they could have destroyed.
So...
How do we introduce a twist?
Okay, so imagine this, right?
You get the narrative of the universe.
And instead of the narrative of being what it is.
It's actually...
Yeah, the hypothesis of this person that lives here.
This is my home.
blah, blah, blah.
You know, they speak about it.
They give the world lore...
And the world lore isn't what they believe it to be.
It's just...
So typically that causes two things to happen.
Two loops for one group is over mine.
We want to show it because everyone is on snow.
And the others want to protect the established order.
Hmm.
Well, I think that's going on too far in the pessimistic route.
Not necessarily, because you don't know what they're going to be people that realize that
I admit it's about talking about this in the wrong way.
Maybe not necessarily containing it, but maybe they want to slow the release of it.
Hmm.
I like to think that the majority of society, I'm trying to...
Okay, so in real life, I don't think people believe themselves to be evil.
There's no one in society trying to prevent it.
It's more like...
There's no real agreed to be a find the reader, because this is collective goal.
You can't suppress a collective goal like that.
Well, no, but you can...
You're not suppressing the goal.
Maybe they don't like...
Not never release the data, but maybe they want to...
Those excuses, they want to take time to look at it.
Release it in packets.
Hmm.
Well, even then, they'll be okay.
You can say that there are official explorers funded by the government or whatever.
And you have the other explorers, and that's fine.
They government let them explore.
It's just there's a funding behind it.
And then freelancers also go about it.
They think they want to pick it for artifacts.
So what if they could find artifacts?
What if they could find it?
It was the thing, though.
The piece of the technology they could sell.
So, the government has pushed a theory that...
Or interest is not...
This is not how you're the path.
This is why we have this path.
This is the reason behind this path, and this is a history.
And then it's suddenly found out to be all wrong.
Maybe not in a majority of people,
but there's going to be a tiny sliver of people
that they'll faithfully shaking.
And it might lead to them having distrust.
The biggest thing about flat authors is they feel they've come across something
that is being suppressed or known for some reason.
If you ask them, there's a million different reasons why it's being suppressed.
But I don't think suppression is...
Again, it's too pessimistic for what I want to build.
If you have a social society, a connected society, a society that's...
You know, they have a collectible.
They all know the collectible.
There are people that are like flat authors that are fucking morons,
but then the other ones that are...
The majority of the people are actually pretty intelligent
regarding their beliefs of the structure.
I love this structure.
This is about how much people will need to clean the power.
You would imagine that power.
Think of a hierarchy.
Dude, let me show you this.
I can't find it again, oh my god.
I just saw Lawrence Krause.
Do you listen to Lawrence Krause quite a bit?
I don't know.
You don't, okay.
Well, I'll show you this anyway.
Did you know we're selling Hong Kong instead of two guys?
For the deal for your base company is doing it.
What?
They...
For the deal for your company, is the one supplying the contracts with two guys with the Hong Kong police?
Oh, jeez.
Yeah, I thought that was hilarious.
And then Russia is being blamed for the bombings of four hospitals in Syria.
In the current war zone where the codes are fighting against the Turkish.
The four hospitals were bombed in less than 12 hours and they were all rebel owned hospitals.
Oh, no.
And I think that optimists me talk about it's really important.
I think it really was one of the things that came start to come, for example.
The idea that science...
I think too often it seems to me in the web science fiction there's a dystopic view of the future that science makes the world a worse place.
But science has made the world a much better place.
People live much happier lives, healthier lives on the whole.
And much longer because of science.
And so that optimistic view is I think incredibly important to push.
Which is how I'm going to almost end this now.
Because I think we've gone over time.
There is one thing that you pointed out.
And there were some questions about this.
And I think I want to address it directly.
Which is the fact that there were more women on this panel.
And it's...
And I was at the Nobel Prize ceremonies a few years ago.
And they addressed the fact that there were more women Nobel laureates.
And what they said was, it's a fact that because of societal issues,
there were women weren't encouraged to go into science.
And the Nobel prizes are given most often for things that have done 20 years earlier, 50 years earlier.
And in 50 years from now, half the Nobel prizes will be for women because they're women in science.
And I'm hoping that events like this...
So is that perspective?
He's being optimistic about the future.
He thinks there's going to be an ocean...
I'll say he's being a little less optimistic and more addressed.
The pattern?
No, not pattern.
But looking at the pattern.
So what he said was, 50 years ago, women were encouraged to go into science.
And most Nobel prizes will be given for events that happened 50 years ago.
Which means that there was a distinct lack of women in those fields.
What he's saying is maybe closer to now as a society we have come together.
And realize, okay, maybe women are all able to do science.
And they are now encouraging it to stem.
When the cause of a false incentive leads to believe women can ride in a cold
because if they went faster than 35 miles per hour, the youth will fall out.
This is real life.
Yes, this is real life.
This is real life.
In Saudi Arabia and Middle East countries, they forbid women to drive
because they think it will give them more orgasms.
Oh my God.
No way.
It's ridiculous.
No.
This is why they don't all know how to drive because they think it will give them unwanted sexual pleasure.
And therefore make them into holes.
They believe if you get pee on your clothes, you can be sent to hell.
Because you're unclean before God.
You don't know that about Muslim rules?
That seems extreme.
No, so Muslim religion has a very strict guidelines on clandiness.
Like, even fording, they suggest you should stop with your prayer, go change, have a shower and come back.
They believe that when you are a God, you need to be as pure as possible.
And prayer is having a direct conversation of God.
Like, before they pray, if you can, you are encouraged to bathe your hands, your face, your arms, and your feet.
You are encouraged to be as clean as possible before you conduct the prayer.
Do you think that is the ultra-orthodox spectrum of this?
Because I don't think the majority of Muslims do not believe this.
This is a very ultra-orthodox, very direct word of the Torah.
What's really important about...
I mean, you've heard about this, I'm sure.
But this is a society, this...
This is ultimately a religious society.
They used to be very mathematical.
Well, so, most people don't realize those five pillars of Islam.
It's not one group, it's five.
Five.
And the group I'm talking about is known as Sufi.
Sufi Islam wants to follow the most direct literal interpretation of the religious text.
They literally want to go back to the time of Allah and the Prophet of Muhammad.
They think that Muhammad lived the most closest life you could.
They believe all technology and advancements is of the devil.
They believe that Muhammad did not have access to it, we should go back.
They were so dedicated to this belief that they still used horses and spears.
You were in a British way, knowing them down in tanks and airplanes.
Oh Jesus, fuck.
I'm not even joking, they...
So they're deliberately kicking themselves back?
Exactly.
They believe all advancement is evil.
They believe that if Allah didn't...
I mean, if Muhammad did not have access to it,
then it is a trick of the devil to bring you away from him and Allah.
And that is what drives the biggest group of terrorism.
But we don't want to discuss that because it's harder to get the public to want to invade a millionth country
when you realize it's not a bunch of crazy people but a small group of crazy people.
Fuck.
Yeah, those five versions of Islam were allies of three of them, enemies of two of them.
And one is kind of a neutral party.
But we're... they're also an ally of ours because they don't have open conflict of us that help us kind of.
Like that's what people don't understand.
Islam isn't this one organization, those five branches.
Some of those branches kill each other, even though they still worship the same God.
They believe they worship the wrong version of them.
And so they're supposed to be evil.
That's kind of why even though Muslims are the largest religion on the world,
when it comes to warfare, they can't really unite.
Because those clerics follow different versions and those different versions don't mesh,
because some of them are very extreme and some of them are very moderate.
Like you have moderate versions where they believe women are equal.
They believe in limited consumption of alcohol and pork.
Mainly for social reasons you're not supposed to do it just because of pleasure.
You're mainly supposed to do it just so you can kind of blend in.
Yeah, it's like Islam has spectrums that they don't talk about because if the public was aware of this,
they wouldn't want to go to wars often.
It's easy to paint an enemy of these stone backwards people.
I mean, they're backwards in some respects, but not in others.
No, this is their narrative that's pushed.
I'm going from purely the propaganda standpoint.
Ah, okay.
Like because Sufi Islamic people are pretty much regal Islam,
but they will just raise in this more extreme version.
Well, literal text is what you need to follow.
There is no real important interpretation.
Interpretation is doubt and doubt is of the devil.
They believe if you have doubts to talk to your cleric and pray of him,
don't pray by yourself.
Pray of a cleric is what they tell you.
A cleric will help you if you're doubted.
Some might be extreme.
The older version of Christianity.
Yeah.
Where we were burning witches and other animals.
Sharia takes kill him.
He walked on the Passover kill him.
It's like that.
This is like Leviticus style Christianity.
You know, I wanted to talk about that.
There was a...
I'm listening to this audible podcast, right?
And he's...
This is an anthropologist.
He's explaining the behavior, human behavior.
This is like a 24-hour thing.
I'm listening to work so long.
But in one aspect of it,
he's talking about how...
It's not me who wouldn't have an honorable credit.
You do?
Okay.
I never used it.
I was on prime so I get a credit every once in a while.
The great ideas of psychology.
Oh, wait.
I think I showed you that one.
I think I have that one on the list.
You might have actually...
Yeah, that's the one I showed you.
I'm listening to it now then.
It's like, oh, I have that on my list already.
Okay, sweet.
I'm glad you recommended this.
This is good stuff.
Oh, you want that?
In the very beginning, they talk about witches.
They used to believe you could catch witches.
I'm like a flu.
Oh, like a flu?
They believed that if you knew a witch,
that some of the evil could wrap off on you.
Some of those sit.
And so they would burn the husbands of witches.
Because, well, she's a witch,
so he's obviously an effective.
No proof.
So they thought it could spread like disease.
Well, they thought the horsemen could wrap off on hand,
make him sinful and corrupt him.
They thought corruption was a little,
but spreadable thing.
What's interesting is they had a means of testing.
Yeah.
Court of Court testing.
Full shit.
Oh, my God.
Do you know that some of those tests?
The proofs.
Being floating.
So some of the other tests,
they would cut off your head.
If you defecated your witch.
Or another one was beware of the cries of a crocodile.
You know, it's like if you tell them the story of Jesus,
it's a bullshit.
And if they cry for real,
they're not witches.
But if they fake cry,
if they crocodile cry,
quote unquote,
they're demons.
And they're devils.
They're witches.
They've given an effective death.
The fall end was made by a priest.
He would check you for a thought.
For what?
He would go around checking women for thought.
You know what?
There was actually one of the roles.
He talked about it.
It was like a...
There were people that were inspecting,
hiding the body.
And we spread it for the skin.
They were looking for that work.
That devil.
Demon marking.
Yeah.
Oof.
See what I mean by just basic things that...
We now know just for the genetic code.
Not working properly.
Oh my god.
Uh.
So...
He goes to the human strat.
Is an ultra sensitivity to UV.
Just by being in it,
you can develop anything from...
As light as sunborns to your skin,
actually, being damaged.
Those are dude.
I don't remember his name.
I'll have to look it up.
He has no hair.
He has no lips.
His nose is...
His face is very melted off.
Pretty much.
He looks like a bone victim.
And it's all from UV.
He didn't know what disease he had.
His parents thought he had depression,
and so doctors were putting him outside.
What the fuck?
He literally has to wear a bag over his body
when he goes out.
He has to wear like a...
He wears like...
A sack of his head, a hat,
clothes, and like, full outfit.
And he's like, I'm not ashamed of myself.
I know what I look like.
I do this because if I go on the sun,
it holds.
Is that...
Is that entirely lack of melatonin?
Or melatonin?
No, it's melanin.
His body...
It's when it receives light from the sun.
It triggers a response of over-sensitivity
from the nervous system,
and it starts attacking the skin.
It's like an over-act immune system.
It aids for the skin, if it makes sense.
But it's accelerated by sunlight.
Whenever he receives ultraviolet light,
his skin over-processes it,
and it triggers a response of the immune system
that attacks the skin.
And well over-the-light hits.
So in, like, instead of his body producing light M&D,
it triggers that response of the lower...
from the system.
The immune system starts attacking this flesh.
Give me...
I'll look him up today.
I'll see you back to find him.
Um, touch your shoulder.
Well, because he was part of a pod...
He was part of a show about extreme genetic mutations.
Yeah, more regard.
Um, just different things the body gets you.
Like, one is, uh, the mouth.
Instead of a cleft lip,
it opens up all the way up to here.
Oh.
Another is, uh, the hand is mimic like this.
Mimicked?
Yeah, it's literally another hand attached.
And it...
Like, the hand is independent,
and it works like this,
but there's a thumb on this side.
Okay, and so on the other side?
It's like the...
It's like having six fingers?
Or like...
Two hands...
Pretty much together, like...
Huh.
But it's on both hands,
and they can be like grab before...
That's...
Fucking nuts.
That's cool, but Jesus Christ.
Um...
You know more than a DFF group?
I'll send you a link to the episode.
It's...
I'm not gonna lie.
They're your bad taste people.
They're horrible people.
They just talk a bunch of shit.
But they tell us some cool topics.
Okay.
They look very low-brow.
They look low-brow,
but they cover interesting topics.
Because they're three stonels,
and what happens is on the Patreon,
they let people pick topics sometimes.
And so it could...
Um...
Medical...
Things.
And the thing that one out was, uh...
Like,
genetic mutations in shit.
And one of the topics they covered was like,
things they can go wrong with the human body.
And I think I can find it.
But I'll shoot you the link on Discord.
Oh, fuck.
Yeah.
Just Patreon-based.
Yeah.
Send me the link...
Or record it or something.
I don't know.
Um...
Or what Patreon is about?
I'll give you my Patreon if I was not a video.
It'll be the only group I'm subscribed to.

really jogging my mind okay so imagine imagine to play as a as a character and
and um okay have you seen watch dogs three yeah we can get you imagine that
right but you're it's in a it's in a smaller social space you play anyone right
you play a character particular character it's like say 20 30 characters right
you play that character through a sequence of events it finalizes and then
you know you play it through a different character oh it saves the ripples it saved
the ripples yeah it's like a [CYOA] but a little more like more complex more connected
more complex more connected and more uh more you see more media it's yeah it's quicker it's not
as it's shorter bursts of interactions so it you affect this more immediate well he's in like
the choice it was slight you know changes you would see like the direct effects of Ailey
so imagine okay there's gonna be front lines for you but imagine like six characters
you're drawing through a weaving match of interactions in the same in the same space to
root your scope but uh you know i think it's limited small but then you have the repetitions
right you you play through all his interest things but say please seek play through six characters
and then you have um sorry i mean i mean i'm gonna finish this on the null um so you play
there's six characters and then a seventh one comes in the seventh one is fully controlled by you
[...]
yeah be like that it's like you have the um you play as the characters internally
you express you're an AI right you're talking to them you're helping them through problems
and then you play three different people in that situation from multiple perspectives
in the same timeline because you're an AI you're everywhere you're
uh getting all those perspectives and you play as yourself at some point and then after you
play as yourself timeline moves on you've been played man of my dog it's a new game man of a dan
man of a yeah we'll do do you have it no but it's like that all right you want to go play it

# REC007 (1).txt
Okay, I'll purify, so I don't know what you're going to do.
That's going to turn me out of terminology for it, actually.
Anyway, so imagine this ice described when the sword's been
swings out and hitting the opponent, and the opponent's sword, you hit a clang noise.
The clang noise is the noise indicator to react.
It's like, in case now you've got to move around and you've got to parry, you've got to faint.
You've got to morph, you've got to chamber, you've got to, you know,
that's the indicator for taking that direction.
Now, as you described at the hand, the pointing of the hand indicates the trajectory
or the overall strength, the path, the path of the sword.
And you have like an arrow above that kind of like...
Maybe I can tell you how it does right now.
But a little more 3D, imagine like you can see the arrow and then you react.
You can see the arrow and then you react.
Or that wavelength, that curve.
Now imagine that clang noise, yeah.
But instead of the clang noise, it's...
Yeah, gotcha.
Mm-hmm.
Right.
But can I...
I want to...
Okay, so you can use that to decide the conversation.
Yeah, it's like the...
It's interrupting is the clanging of this conversation.
Well, I could really like an outside tangent.
Yeah, exactly.
And then you take right and left.
You can keep taking that tangent or you can switch to new one
or you can...
You can break through their interruption or you can let them take the interruption.
So if that explains the entire mechanic going back and forth and you're holding it.
Dada da da da da da da.
And then you have to decide, though, do you state the conversation?
Do you switch, or do you see under the control of the pulsing.
Yeah.
Pretty much.
Well, cause a very interesting thing about conversation.
Wait, so you say one more time, you, what, to the person, the answer and influence.
Yeah, you use your own influence in this person, you're talking to them, you're communicating to them.
You're communicating to the internal person.
Yeah.
If that makes sense, you're communicating to the internal mind of this person.
And they're outwardly expressing to other people.
Or you, you could engage in conversation, but I'd be a little confused and have six voices instead of, or have 12 voices instead of six.
You know what?
No, I mean like, it's kind of like, you can use conversation to convey a certain time to get them to reach a certain emotional response.
Exactly.
So you can kind of, you can almost manipulate, but you don't have to.
It's more like you're, you're helping people, right?
You're helping people.
Okay, this is, they don't mean that.
It's more like you use the manipulation.
Exactly.
So like you're, you're swinging through conversations.
I don't know, that sounds a little bit too blunt for conversations.
Well, it's got to be subtle.
It can't be like, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, it's got to be like, ding.
Won't you use any sound tones anyway?
Ding.
Ding.
There's won't you use any sound tones anyway?
Yeah.
I think sound tones might be a good idea.
That's a good idea.
You can get a vein.
Have you played the, what is that game?
It's a puzzle game.
I think it's like, perhaps, something like that.
But it has visual puzzles and audio puzzles.
And if you don't have tension, you can't solve the audio puzzles.
But you have what tells you what it's supposed to be.
You literally start off with a puzzle.
So it's, it's not going to visualize in which direction it goes.
No.
The whole thing is, it's one giant puzzle broken into sections.
I think I have it on this.
Okay.
I don't think I have it installed, but I have it on my game.
What game is, what was title again?
It was, what's one?
I'm trying to find it right now.
Because right now, my mind is coming to Catherine.
You play Catherine?
So Catherine, you're working through these puzzles, yeah?
You're kind of having a conversation with the internal part of your head, right?
You're like, you're, you're fighting against something in this guy's dreams, in this guy's mind or whatever.
Yeah.
And you're fighting through multiple dreams.
It's like a linear stream of dreams.
I'm thinking more like a, for humans, in this situation, it'd be like, multiple streams of dreams, but at the same time.
Make sure the dreams are your communication.
I think I'll explain that.
What's it?
Hmm.
That's all good.

That's fun, isn't it?
Pire.
Pire analysis.
Pire.
It is better to have loved and lost
than never to have loved the tool
and still lost.
This extra ingredient in the mix...
It complicates things somewhat.
Tick Max Payne.
I'm sure Max used to wax lyrical about Michelle
to his buddies down at the force,
but I don't really get to see that.
Short cut scene, a comic strip,
and boom, I'm at home.
Something's wrong.
Our house has been turned...
And I'd like to now praise a game
that manages to weave together its mechanics and story
in such a way that losses felt.
They capture that feeling.
The essence.
A game is Pire.
Pire is a hybrid of sorts.
Ostensibly a party RPG
about ritualistic basketball.
Super giant games bring their pawn shop
for world building and fuse it together
with a fun and colourful cast
before finishing off with a sport-based bow.
The rights themselves are...
serviceable.
The game treads a wobbly line
between real-time and turn-based
with no AI for the other members of your three-man team.
They just stay static.
We're not directly controlled.
In theory, they should lead to deaths,
switches on the fly, creating openings
with one character before passing off the ball
to exploit them.
Or, if you're me,
completely ignoring my other teammates
while dashing Maddie around the pitch
as fast as my little late carry me,
dying into any opportunities
that present themselves.
That's the police resistance
and all that jazz.
Later on,
there was a difficulty modifier
which ups the auntie
forcing you to engage with, you know,
tactics.
And this feels like it should have
maybe been the baseline setting.
Anyway, enough gripping
and onto the more interesting bits.
Real joy of the game comes
through how these rights are fused
into the backbone of the story.
And it's here that I'll place my
customary spoiler warning.
The endings of Pire
but one of the major plot points
on the way
will be revealed.
So please,
if the game seems like
your cup of tea,
please go play it.
Oh, wait.
I haven't played it yet.
I don't know.
Yeah, fuck it.
I've learned.
I love this game.
Boy!
Because I swear it exists.
I mean,
I think your computer might be
easier to find the aimless.
Yeah.
You know, you're using Google instead
of like searching the Playstation.
Well, I'm searching Playstation.
Yeah, I know.
Shooting.
I found Pire.
Where?
I found Pire through Google.
I could have swat butter on my PS4.
I must have it on my Xbox instead.
I think this one.
You creative auto-tires.
Never think about the damage your genre
defying games are going to do.
Think of all those innocent shit heads
in the 2000s who bought Killer 7
because it was tentatively classified
as a shooter.
And ended up tragically suffering
independent thoughts
and generally becoming better human beings.
And now, look.
What convenient capital umbrella
label am I supposed to put on Pire
as super giant games?
I suppose there's always action adventure
but that's as informative
as a 19th century sex manual.
Oh, you want to think outside the box, New Year?
Or maybe sometimes I like being in a box?
Because it's warm in a box and safe
and sometimes they contain packets of cheesy walks.
Anyway, Pire is a new game
from the creators of Bastion and Transistor,
which involved defiance of established pattern
is neither isometric, nor narrated by a bloke
with a voice-like melted chocolate dripping
off a Darth Vader mask.
So here we fucking go.
Pire is best classified as a beautiful novel,
party-based role-playing
three-on-three basketball simulator.
Blimey.
It's lucky no one buys games from physical shops anymore
because this will need a whole new shelf.
And the label would be longer than the shelf.
Buckle up while I attempt to explain this.
In an impressive fantasy kingdom,
literacy is banned, perhaps the most sensible
response to the popularity of 50 shades of grey books.
You, by which I mean to play a character,
the BC Unpresent serial masturbator watching this,
are a scholar, exiled to the wilderness below the civilized world,
who hooks up with a group of fellow exiles
that need you to read a book they found that tells them
about the secret rituals that have the power to free them from exile.
For some reason, it turns out the rituals all involved
going up against a similar group
and competing to throw a ball into the other team's hole.
If it seems like a rather contrived explanation
for the three-on-three basketball thing,
that's because it bloody well is.
Oh yes, and doing your Odyssey-come basketball tournament,
you attract several more party members
each representing one of the sentient fantasy races
in a case of what we academics call
the traditional BioWare Bro Buffet.
Most of the gameplays are visual novel style,
all the action and dialogue in plain text,
while characters are represented by beautiful hand-painted cardboard cutouts on sticks.
And that didn't burn well for me.
I don't like visual novels much,
because call me a rabbetianly handsome stick in the mud with a great big cock.
But I prefer my games to have some, you know,
gameplay in them.
But nevertheless, I kept playing
reached the first sacred basketball match
and then went,
never mind, let's go back to the visual novel stuff.
Let's gameplay less!
I wondered what the fucking target audience for this game could be
via overlap between people who like fantasy visual novels
and people who like NBA Jam,
can't be the biggest niche in the world.
But I stuck with it,
and after playing it all the way to the end,
I think I prepared to say I like fire.
Obviously, I dropped the basketball difficulty to low,
because honestly, who gives a shit?
But I should have remembered that
super giant games are pretty good
at this whole interactive storytelling lag,
and scratched my scrawny scrotum
if I didn't genuinely want to see what happened to these characters.
We call it the BioWare Bro Buffet,
but between this and Persona 5,
BioWare seemed to be the worst at it.
Again, I liked the fire lad to lot more than I did
to mass-faith-actometer Burger King Kids Club,
in spite of them only being still images
that didn't make any effort to emote,
or possibly because of.
The turning point for me was when we reached
the final climactic basketball match on the peak of Mount Globetrotter
and the game goes psych.
Only one of your party members gets to return from exile,
you have to choose which,
and everyone else pisses off home to rub gravel
in their hair until the next basketball tournament.
I mean, ritual.
The plot then continues with your chosen party member gone.
Forever.
Presumably happy, but you don't see or play with them again,
and that's what makes the difference.
In your massive wrecks and your flagging ages,
you can be sure that all the losers who latch on to you,
like needy primary school children
to the playground monitor,
are going to be stinking up your castle,
mooching off your fantasy unemployment benefit forever.
And there's always going to be one or two losers
who you never used,
because you can't be bothered to get them up to speed with everyone else.
But with a simple addition of us having to pick a party member to lose every now and again,
turns that on its head.
Suddenly, I had to level up Joe Scratchbumb
and Melissa Knowspick,
because the characters I like,
had spent the most time with,
and were the most effective on the playing field,
with the ones I most wanted to set free.
At which point they'll be happy,
but I'll have to push through the rest of the plot
with all the fat weaselads that I picked last.
Things really melancholy up and not towards the end,
but your real life basketball season is coming to a close,
and you're not going to be able to liberate everyone.
I've been deliberately hanging on to a couple of good characters
just to keep the matches expedient,
and that was going to be an awkward conversation in the showroom.
SuperDiant Games were always effectively melancholy
through a combination of appealing art and sad music,
and there was a very real lump in my throat
whenever an old hand disappeared forever
into a new glorious existence,
as I tearfully made my way to the nearest pawn shop
to floggle their gear for cash.
On that note, it turns out there's not a whole lot of depth
to three-on-three basketball,
pulled ball in the hole,
that's a design document done in four words,
so the token RPG elements feel a bit needless.
Your characters level up and gain new buffs,
and equip items to give them buffs,
but the only buffing that really matters on the court
is the kind of janitor that does to the floor.
Yes, this is probably because I turned the difficulty down low,
but an extra 25% damage Joe Scratchbumb
does do enemies who've just eaten Mexican food
or whatever, doesn't add much,
when all you need to do is run circles around the other dudes
for a bit, then put ball in hole.
I was into the story,
but frankly, the actual basketball matches
started to feel like an unwanted obligation.
I very carefully planned the order I wanted to liberate my chap roster,
and I didn't want my severely wanting capacity
for team sports to mess with it.
For you, see, losing a match doesn't end the game.
One of the NBC players might end up getting liberated
instead of yours,
and changing the entire course of the story
is the kind of pressure I don't need,
resting on my ability to dribble.
Maybe there could be some even easier difficulty setting
that replaces all the basketball matches
with two buttons marked win and lose,
and if you still want there to be drama,
maybe the win button could have a spider on it.
Still, the fact that the story can keep going
regardless of what combinations of characters have been booted skywards
is testament to the writing on display,
and if the writing is good in a game that's mostly visual novel,
then wrap it up, Jose,
because I think we're done.
Supergiants succeed in doing the organically branching story
thing by focusing more on characters
and they're into plays than the central driving plot.
After all, a good story is nothing but the actions of characters
hoping to lead to cut with your teddy shot.
But you do both.
Yeah.
And you do the backstory and you do the characters.
You do both at the same time, it's a good story.
You know this is one of the characters first.
They know about Warhammer.
One of the most interesting things about Warhammer
is it's one of the few series where you see the world
from the villain's eyes,
and you realize there's no good guy.
Because the Imperium,
for all its attempts of trying to help
has gone to this age,
we'll corrupt you this drive.
And now,
those two groups flying for power.
And in this Warhammer power,
they're literally just extorting the whole world.
One of the groups has this thing called extortment-honest,
where they can just,
to tell my planet,
it has torn the heretic.
Tyler Chaos Guards will against the Emperor,
and they send the shipping
and the ship literally just collapses the core of the planet.
Damn.
Hey, Tristan,
are you going to have to play Destiny 2 again?
No, it's free.
What is it?
I don't know, you have Destiny 2.
It's on the transfer to Steam.
And they're developing a warframe now.
It's a free player.
You want to join me too?
What's up?
It's Destiny 2, it's free to play now.
It's on Steam.
Eventually, I'm going to have to Wednesday
because I'm going to buy at least Shadowkeep.
No, no, it's free.
I know, but I want to get the Shadowkeep thing.
Oh, I see.
And if I do the bundle thing,
I gotcha, you want to do it?
You want to do it all at once?
Let me see.
Let's see, look, this is witness.
It's literally just you,
buy yourself in this war.
You can know information about this.
Oh, the witness!
The witness!
Oh, dude, you're going to do it.
Oh, my God.
So it's like,
okay.
Yeah, let me...
The game we're trying to build.
It's Pire and Witness.
That's an interesting combination, yeah?
Pire Witness and a little bit of Mirror's Edge,
or Tomb Raider.
But I love this game.
It was so shippy.
And I knew it was...
Oh, you got to help me out with this man.
I got so lost.
I got stuck at the boat.
I don't know what you're next.
Oh, the map.
The map is a puzzle.
Well, that was...
It shows it.
I didn't think what you were using the map.
Jesus Christ.
The map is a puzzle.
That's crazy good design.
The witness.
Have you played Pire?
What's this?
It came out like three years ago.
That's so cool.
That's okay.
Pire and the witness and a little bit of Mirror's Edge.
Pire is the one.
And Tomb Raider.
I hate this show.
That one looks fun.
I know it's an accent for you.
And...
Oh, there's no inspiration there.
Why do you use such a shippy game?
Because...
The way it incentivizes you is the fact of information.
It doesn't tell you anything.
But as you explore, you start to piece.
You still get the puzzle already?
Forms.
You start off thinking it's simple puzzles.
It's literally go up to a board.
Draw a pattern like this.
Oh, find the broken wire.
It teaches you things.
Yeah, but then as you do it,
you start...
The puzzle stops raising in complexity.
And you start seeing that there's a grand reason behind all these puzzles that are objective.
Oh.
And as you start compiling the objectives,
you start figuring out what that final objective is.
Dude, that's so cool.
Actually, I didn't realize that I was doing all this tone in a single light.
And then I saw all the light.
And I saw it went through a direction.
And I realized, oh, there's more.
And as you connect more and more,
you start realizing, oh,
there's a reason all these lights are connecting.
And you realize it's a power source.
That is the most contried power source ever.
But that's cool.
That's really fucking sweet.
Whoa, so something destroyed all of it.
Oh, it's so broken.
Oh, okay.
That's the thing.
That's the way to describe it, actually.
You're repairing a damaged structure
by piecing together all the parts.
Okay, because the whole strength of the game
you're literally just finding broken wires
and rerouting power around them.
That'd be interesting.
What if the Atlas pillar is damaged?
Or the entrance to that?
The pillar is damaged.
And you're working to prepare the entrance.
Oh, maybe they don't have to be the Alice pillar.
Maybe they have to be what they built.
What do you remember they built?
Like the door to the Alice pillar is the, uh...
You're taking components.
They came up with a piece.
So you didn't describe that.
The Alice pillar was smooth, right?
So it's cylindrical and it's smooth.
You know what?
I think let's make it to the degree that a tree bark is.
It's like layers of cells.
So you said they haven't made it in yet.
I know.
Maybe they haven't been.
They tried to build a way in.
And it got damaged.
Build a way in how?
Like they can't get in the material.
Oh, no, they can.
Let's say they can.
Well, not don't even have a bee.
They can't have a bee.
They're trying.
Because these are the testing still, right?
What I was thinking is, what if people arrived here first?
People scavenged, right?
And they scavenged more than they realized.
They thought it would do the artifacts to, you know,
the little things to sell.
But a reality that was the entrance to the tomb.
The entrance to the pillar.
So you need to work, as the character,
you need to work through and final the pieces.
And they put together, they put together the door.
And they find your way in.
I was saying, well, like, because you don't have a door.
If they're doing test labs,
I think it would be like a lab sitting.
You know, you're not right.
What if they take these pieces and they're seeking to study them?
They're seeking to do research.
But you've got to convince all these people that they're well-meaning people.
But a lot of people think they're evil, but they're not.
They want to learn.
They have attachment to the thing, too.
They could.
There could be various attachments.
If you talk to each of these people individually,
I think that you could really learn a lot about them.
So imagine like you're.
Imagine there being a character in a social space, right?
That person has a piece.
You have like a local community.
You have like 23rd people.
You can work to solve the mystery to find out where this piece is.
And maybe some person doesn't know they have the piece.
They have a thing that they found that it's actually been decorated as something else.
What was the thing?
Because you said that they've scavenged when the four people got there, right?
Yeah, they scavenged a bit.
It was like a.
Not rating, but like they wanted to learn as much as they could.
Yeah, they just do care sort of people.
Finding stuff that all the pieces got divided.
It's like with the Egyptian.
What do you call the Egyptian artifacts?
Also.
They were separated in private collections.
No, I mean, it is because we do research.
It's pretty well.
So when one Pharaoh was dying, it's the end of the next begin.
It was common practice for that fellow to go and erase all the traces of the previous Pharaoh.
How do we get some reclective Pharaohs?
We have multiple Pharaohs.
We have multiple tombs, multiple pyramids, because the Muslim tombs.
The tombs.
The Pharaohs have put a history of themselves, not tombs.
Egyptian tombs have a story of the life of the Poles.
Oh, that was meant to preserve their history.
Oh, my God.
So most hieroglyphics were done outwards.
Like they were erased shape.
So common practices, if you didn't like the message of the last Pharaoh,
is you would go in and carve all the way back down and have yours erased.
It wasn't so rare to see that hieroglyphs started being carved in,
because they're harder to destroy.
What if this thing is almost a cartoon?
Grammacies figured out they had to destroy my legacy if I dig it in here.
And so that's why Egyptian hieroglyphics somewhat outweighed race,
because of all the new ones, all dug deep into the stone,
because they all hold with their manipulative.
That's crazy.
So they've built...
It's an immense museum.
It's their culture, their heritage.
Their heritage is layers upon layers upon layers of complex social behavior.
And also those courts that rose up,
that rose the power because they were to manipulate the planet's succession.
So those schisms that broke out in Egyptian social sexual,
those, the belief that the emperor was Pharaoh,
I mean, the Pharaoh was a god.
It was like the direct son of Osiris.
Well, there was a court that rose up that believed that
the sun was the shoe god,
because the sun was the eye of Osiris,
and they wanted to worship the sun instead of the Pharaoh.
The Pharaohs of the time used it as a challenge to their power base
and crack down on this court.
So have you ever seen the stylized hat
that a Pharaoh was wearing?
So depending on the...
Yeah, but that equals the dark heads and the...
No, it's a different one as a color hat.
So Egyptian Pharaohs wore a hat of either white or red
before the empire was united,
but afterwards it was a hat of white and a red piece representing the two sides
of Egypt all across the narrow river.
This little piece of clothing went from being a sign of division
to a sign of unity for Egypt.
The Egypt used to be two factions,
and eventually they came to a peace.
They coalesced, they reconmined.
Was it now over the division?
Yeah, the way that they got over it is that united,
and that sign of unity was this visual hat of this red white cloth.
So then you have...
And it was every time they went to war
they would look at that as a unifying symbol.
Like, no, we might be divided,
but we'll still want Egypt.
It's a symbol for unity, eventually, somehow,
because those...
These social spaces got larger and more spread out.
Yeah, and then that eventually became an symbol for division.
What was they spread out?
Countries.
And those countries started looking in an Egypt.
And as they were going to war,
the Mesopotamians, the Syrians,
were taking advantage of that warmth
and conquering huge slits of Egypt.
So Egypt's ports of it got enslaved
by African traitors that came up,
they had better weapons.
So Egyptian tactics tidily resorted around
Sherry's warfare and a cold sword,
kind of like a sickle.
They didn't really have to establish
shock tactics at the time.
It wasn't until after the African conquerors
that they developed their own shock tactics.
Egypt's fought like the British did.
Lord Formation's meaning, fighting with a discipline in lines.
African tribes use shock tactics like Chakazoo,
quick battles, quick moving battles
that won't start if they keep moving or shifting.
Or he's moving around.
Pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing
and pushing.
They were using ambushes.
So an African tactic.
But they're very strategic.
You don't attack from one side.
You attack from multiple sides.
Typically Egyptian tactics were open for battles.
So it's the two always with me and engage.
So there's more division later on
than there is earlier on.
Like imagine, there's the two large tribes
that led the divisions to become one.
Yeah, and they branched out again
and they smaller groups that went on to destroy.
That came up.
So African Egypt were annexed to each other.
And people were coming in from Africa and writing Egypt
because we can Egypt.
Egypt's united because they realized
that these people were kicking their ass.
They realized it was either United or Die.
Like it seems they were pretty fucked up to each other.
Yeah.
So one prince, they noticed one of his men.
They cut us up and noticed and test into the wall
and they forced him to march.
I don't need that visual.
Oh god.
That's disappointing.
That was a punishment for being a traitor.

Hey, rule. I know it's a little weird. I'm recording as opposed to typing, but I need
to convey the fact that so L2 and R2 both represent different directions and the NPC that's
on the sign when you're not talking to can interject from either of those directions. You can use
R2 and L2 to go on tangents with one person and another person can also interject there as
well. So it just needs to be present both hands, really. Get back to me when you're
going to guess. Thanks.

and objection and response. Now some of you will probably object to this
inconclusiveness. You will argue that people are supposed to be rational,
reasonable, and logical creatures. You may also think that appealing to someone's
emotions is a way of deceiving him, as it is often in the real world, and you
have probably probably probably probably been taught in your class and other
books and in other books and writing. The logical writing is good and
emotional. The logical writing is good and emotional writing is bad. I will
try these objections as fairly as I can. First, rhetoric is the study of human
communication as it is, not as it ought to be. Indeed, if people were
computers or angels or just creatures of pure reason and logic, there would be
no need for rhetoric. Pure logic would serve us all very well, but we all
recognize that people have emotions as well as reason. Indeed, if people were
computers or angels or just creatures of pure reason and logic, there would be
no need for rhetoric. Pure logic would serve us all very well, but we all
recognize that people have emotions as well as reason. Secondly, rhetoric does
not exclude reason and logic. It merely recognizes that reason and logic are
not always sufficient either to make a person respond as you wish him to or to
get him to act as you wish him to. How many times have you argued about politics
with your father and uncle? No matter how logical your arguments seem to be, they
never change their opinions. They, too, are probably amazed at your failure to
respond to their logic. Thirdly, rhetoric recognizes that emotional appeals have
their validity. Validity, too. No one can prove with facts or logic that it is
absolutely that. No one can absolutely prove with facts or logic that it is
absolutely better for us, better for American, better for an American to have a
job than for a Saudi American to have that job. But Americans are, in fact, more
concerned about unemployment in America than in other countries. Such a bias
is emotional, but quite natural and normal. But no, oh my, such a bias is
emotional, but quite natural and normal. I should also point out to have, it shouldn't
be normal though, that everyone should have work that suits them well. So it's
the way they feel contented in it. We should have all this stuff figured out by now.
What the heck? Why are we wasting ourselves? Why are we putting it all to wealth?
What are these things of gain? What is having a home? What is having a
having a having this? We have these strange imaginations of what we are, what we
ought to have. And what we ought to have is not necessarily the best thing. What we
have, what we ought to have is not, is not so best related to what we are. We've
lost our, our, our tribe, we've lost our society. We have so separated
ourselves from the other.


# REC043.txt
So all of us, we ought to have good work, work the means something to us, work the
work that's effective to us, work that has benefits to our communities and would be
through our lives, to our, if you have good work, work that you find genuine passion
and that you had, then you would have work that is, work that is, work that is of benefits
to your soul.


# REC044.txt
I should also point out the ethical appeal, which is not strictly logical.
It is one that often works to our advantage.
We trust the advice of parents, teachers, priests, ministers, lawyers, counselors, and friends,
especially if we don't have any reasonable knowledge about the subject.
For example, if a close friend says, the movie at strand at strand stinks, the movie at strand
stinks.
Okay, this thing sucks.
We will probably go to some other movie or to no movie at all.
If a lawyer tells us, don't sign the contract, it's two full of loopholes, we probably won't
sign.
We trust the character of the speaker, even though we may not understand why.
That's the normal part of living.
That's a normal part of living.
Redric, then, redric, then, is the study of how audiences are affected, whether by
a motion, reason, or trust in the character of the speaker.
Redric, redric, or a rhetorician, rhetorician, i.e. one skilled in redric, evaluates a speech
or a piece of writing, according to how effectively a speaker or a writer communicates certain
opinions or information to an audience, either one person or a group in a certain situation,
standards of rhetorical effectiveness.
The explanation in the preceding paragraph seems clear enough.
But it also seems pretty vague.
How can we tell how anyone will respond to any appeals in any situation?
Isn't that just a hit or miss procedure in which we're more likely to miss than to
hit or to put the question more generally in a track play?
Can there be any system to rhetoric when rhetoric deals with the whims of human personality?
To answer that question, let's consider what may be a familiar situation for you and
many other college students.
Suppose you need $50 for a weekend skiing or surfing or just having a blast.
Don't you have a strategy for asking your parents for some money?
Perhaps you write to your father at his office, or you may telephone your mother when you
know your father won't be home, or perhaps you write to tell how hard you've been
studying.
Something that's shown by the A's on your last three exams.
And explain how you really need some relaxation.
In other words, in other words, you do have
rhetorical strategy, a plan for presenting your character and your case in the best
possible light for your audience.
Now this example of having a parent for money, now this example of asking a parent for
money, asking a parent for money is a good rhetorical model in the sense that effectiveness
of the rhetoric is easy to judge.
If you don't get the money, your rhetoric has been ineffective.
If you do get the money, your rhetoric has been effective.
If you don't get the money, your rhetoric has been ineffective.
That's a pretty easy situation to evaluate.
However, it is not always so easy to judge the effectiveness of a rhetoric because our
rhetorical goal is not always an action or an objective result.
Often our goal in writing is not to get somebody to do something.
We may want merely to explain something to someone or we may want someone to sympathize
with us or we may want our audience to think more carefully about our subject.
A work of rhetoric must be judged in relation to its purpose.
A textbook is rhetorically effective if students learn from it.
The book must contain accurate information and must present that information clearly
in a well-organized pattern.
A letter of condolence is effective if it represents your emotions about the deceased, while
while offering comfort to the bereaved.
A poem is effective if it's readers, whoever they might happen to be, enjoy the poem.
The standards of rhetorical effectiveness, oh, the standards of rhetorical effectiveness
for a personal letter intended for intended for a friend may differ from those.


# REC045.txt
The standards of rhetorical effectiveness for a personal letter intended for a friend
may differ from those for a poem intended for the public, present and to come, and the
standards will differ for an ad, and the standards and the standards will differ for an ad, for
an ad that is intended to sell a product, and a letter that seeks to tell a close friend
that you were thinking about him, and that you were thinking about him, and the letter
that seeks to tell a close friend that you were thinking about him, and that you care about him.
However, the ultimate standard of rhetoric is still the same. You will want to know whether your
message has, message have the effect you wanted it to on your audience. That is the heart of
rhetoric and the rhetorical method. As a matter of fact, you and I, you and I and those around us
have been practicing rhetoric for most of our lives. You've known for a long time that you
don't talk to the family minister the same way you talk to your kids sister, and you know that
you don't deal with a college English professor the same way you deal with your mother.
A lot of you have probably already discovered perhaps to your dismay that you can't deal with
college professors in the same way you dealt with high school teachers, because you've been
practicing rhetoric on your life. The formal studies, the formal study of rhetoric won't be too
difficult for you. The two difference will be that your study of rhetoric will now be more
systematic and rigid. You will need to ask, you will need, you will be asked to think more
carefully and analytically about your rhetorical decisions. These few examples have been, have
probably been enough to show that you show you that there is a there is a method to rhetoric.
These few examples have probably probably been enough to show you that there is a method to rhetoric.
Most of the rest of this book will deal with the method, deal with that method and how you can
apply it to make your writing more effective. However, before doing anything else, let's get back
to our original problem. Congressman Fairweather.

# REC047.txt
An ideal retortion, what then, will influence us, or a congressman like Fairweather?
Let's try to compose a letter that will combine all three approaches in a successful balance.
Let's write a letter that is rational yet emotional, presented by a writer who is attractive
and credible.
Dear congressman, Fairweather, I have been pleased with your work for this district,
Dear congressman, Fairweather, I have been pleased with your work for this district in
Congress, especially with your splendid efforts that resulted in the Spring Valley Flood
Control Project.
Because I know that you are anxious to make sound legislative decisions for your constituents,
I thought it would pass along some information to you about the Honey Import Act.
This information should help you to understand why I think you should vote for the bill.
First of all, passage of the bill will mean more honey for Americans, which will mean
lower prices.
Second, the lowering of trade barriers will allow the major honey exporting nations to
increase their trade with the United States, thus allowing these nations to buy more American
goods.
This will help these nations as well as us.
Buying honey from our neighbors in Mexico and Argentina will help these friends in Latin
America.
I know that farmers will complain about the loss of revenue, but they can easily raise
other crops, like wheat and soybeans.
Something that farmers in other nations could not always do, cannot always do.
The price of honey has been kept artificially high for too long, and the farmers have been
the only group.
The benefit from this protective legislation besides the fact that we are a honey exporting
nation indicates that there is plenty of profit in honey, with or without artificial price
supports.
The interests of the general public should outweigh the loss of income to farmers.
Which will not be that great anyway.
Thus I urge you to vote for the Honey Import Act.
I am sure, however, that whatever decision you make will be in the best interest of the
district, the nation and the world, sincerely, surely, surely green.
Surely green's letter should be an effective one, because she uses all three appeals effectively.
She starts out by appealing to Congressman Fairweathers emotions, specifically she praises
him for his achievements, and then appeals to his sense of duty and his sense of fairness.
She characterizes him as a man trying to do his best, something that probably will make
that Congressman a receptive reader.
Not only are Ms. Green's emotional appeals sound, but her ethical appeal is excellent.
Her praise of Congressman Fairweather indicates that she is knowledgeable about him and sympathetic
towards him.
Moreover, she appears helpful and reasonable.
She is not simply telling the Congressman how to vote, but she is giving him information
on her position.
As she puts it, she is trying to make him understand her position in a rational way, but she does
make her stand, but she does make her stand clear.
Her second paragraph relies strongly on rational appeal.
It contains both facts and carefully-reasoned arguments, underlying the facts and arguments
are basic assumptions about the welfare of the United States and its citizens, ultimately
and the premise, ultimately, and the premise can neither be proved or nor disproved.
She implies that the Congressman's chief concerns should be for America.
The argument is one of self-interest, one of the most emotionally compelling reasons
to do anything.
The third paragraph, which anticipates objections that some might have to passage of the bill,
is largely rational.
However, such a phrase as artificially high for too long has some strong emotional overtones.
The last paragraph, again, appeals to the Congressman's emotions.
It praises his judgment and indicates trust in him.
From doing so, of course, Ms. Green's ethical appeal remains high.
A moreover, she does manage to restate her position at the beginning of the paragraph.
All in all, it is impossible to say how Congressman Fairweather will vote.
However, we do know that he is very likely to read his letter sympathetically.
The letter does what it should.
It presents the writer in her content to the audience in such a way.
I'm still here, you're a tiny thing, you're like bored, I get it, I'm sorry.


# REC048.txt
Then the last paragraph, again, appeals to Congressmen's emotions.
It praises his judgment in a case trust.
I'm so bored of that student.
I'm so bored of this too.
I'm bored of this.
We project, but goddamn it.
I'm bored of this.
I'm only in page 20.
You got to finish the book.
Discovering what to say.
It's got to be great.
Chapter 5.
Yeah, let's imagine the future here.
Heck yeah, that's going to be great.
That's going to be awesome.
I'm going to love that.
All right.
I have toilet rum or left off though.
Now, the last paragraph.
Again, appeals to Congressmen's emotions.
It praises his judgment in a case trust in him.
In doing so, of course, Ms. Green's ethical appeal remains high.
Moreover, I found my center finally with Heck.
I'm sorry for that.
I mean, it's good knowledge though.
I hope you appreciate it.
One more can I let her do.
One more can I let her do.
One more can this say so really do for us.
Look at that snow.
Oh my goodness.
I thought we were done.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.


# REC050.txt
So, this text is on rhetoric, ethereum practice for composition, it's by Walter S. Minan.
Yeah, a preface.
When I was young, when I was young and easy, when I was young and easy and first began work on.
Young and easy and first began work on rhetoric, ethereum practice for composition quite a few years ago.
I intended to compose a freshman writing text that would save the world or at least revolutionize the teaching of composition.
Now that my book has undergone the scrutiny of several editors and many more reviewers, my hopes are a bit more modest.
I have, however, retained my enthusiasm for my substantive goals.
The goal was to publish a text that was both solid, solidly grounded, solid, solid, god damn it, solid, solidly grounded.
In rhetorical theory, yet clear and elementary enough for average freshmen at state universities, community, community, community.


# REC051.txt
That goal was to publish a text that was both solidly grounded in rhetorical
theory, yet clear and elementary enough for average freshman at State
University's community colleges and other colleges where the majority of
students need the help of one or two semesters devoted to composition.
I believe in this book. Comes as near its goal as I can make it. The underlying, okay,
the underlying assumption of rhetoric theory and practice for composition are these.
Oh boy, rhetoric, rhetoric theory and practice, this thing, okay. One, writing takes place when a writer
faces a situation in which he or she has to do it. Why can't you just do it?
It's not near text, but it's important to read it right.


# REC052.txt
The underlying assumptions of rhetoric, theory, and practice for composition are these.
One, writing takes place when a writer faces a situation in which he or she has to, oh,
has to.
Oh my God, dude, come on.
Well, you suck.


# REC053.txt
Okay, in rhetoric, in this practice of rhetoric, number one, writing takes place when a writer
faces a situation in which he or she has to, has two or wants to communicate, two.
The form of the writing is determined by the rhetorical situation, not by external standards
or models.
And three, classical rhetoric provides a simple, yet useful framework for learning to write.
Using these assumptions, I have tried to create a freshman writing text that is practical,
realistic, and theoretically consistent.
This text is practical in that, in that it deals with the kinds of writing that most students
will use both inside and outside of class.
The focus is on using persuasion, using persuasion and exposition in practical situations, such
as reports for teachers or employers, letters, data on public issues, and other forms of
public and private discourse.
The emphasis is on communication as it occurs in the student's experience.
As this text is meant to be practical, most of the illustrations and examples of both
good and bad writing are drawn from non-literary sources.
There are selections from textbooks, popular magazines, scholarly journals, newspaper articles,
letters to editors, student themes, and advertisements.
The analysis of these selections emphasizes clear persuasive communication, rather than
literary merit, or the falling of pre-established patterns, such as comparison and contrast or
definition.
One will, I hope, set rhetoric theory and practice for composition, apart from other freshman
texts, text, text, text, is that aimed to be practical and realistic is its consistent
adherence to a theory of rhetoric.
The theory is ultimately aerostolian, focusing on three basic elements in rhetorical situation,
content, audience, and persona.
This text is not simply a summary or rehashing of Aristotle's rhetoric, rather it is an adaptation
of the basic theory of Aristotle's Aristotle and uses content, audience, and persona as
the touchstones for evaluating rhetorical effectiveness.
He says, I have followed the lead of, I read this before though, the plan of this book
is to move from the larger problems facing the student writer down to smaller, subtler problems.
The first chapter deals with the nature of the rhetorical system.
It tries to suggest the divisions involved and the resources available when a writer faces
a writing situation.
The next three chapters, each deal with one of the elements in the rhetorical situation,
as outlined by Aristotle, content, audience, and persona.
My strategy is to encourage students to see that they have been communicating all their
lives and that these processes are not mysterious.
My strategy in putting these chapters first is to encourage students to see that they
have been communicating all their lives and that the processes are not mysterious.
They should, meanwhile, be learning that writing is merely an extension, albeit more conscious
of their previous experiences in communicating.
The middle chapters of the book deal with two of the major departments of classical rhetoric.
The middle chapters of this book deal with two of the major departments, major departments
of classical rhetoric, discovery, invention, as in quotation marks, an organization is an
organization in quotation marks arrangement.
The chapter on invention does not treat the classical topics as rigidly as rigidly
and as meticulously as some textbooks have.
Instead, it suggests some of the major strategies for discovering what to say.
It also suggests some of the possible steps in the pre-writing stage of composition.
The chapter on organization does deal with the pattern of the classical iteration, but
that is not its chief emphasis.
Rather, it suggests a variety of organizational patterns based on argumentative structure.
It is the probable reaction of the audience and the importance of the persona.
The last three chapters deal with style, moving from larger to smaller units.
The seventh chapter, on the paragraph, is a bridge between organization and style.
In it, I have relayed, I have relied, I have relied heavily on the theories of, I have
relied heavily on the theories of generative rhetoric as developed by Christiansen.
The eighth chapter deals with sentences in the last words, I have treated gobbly, gobbly
book, gobbly, gobbly, gobbly book.
As, that word again, in both chapters, but mostly in the chapter, a whole section of
that chapter is devoted to the causes and cures of gobble, gobble-dee-gook.
In acknowledging those who helped me with the text, I would like to begin with those
to whom I owe an intellectual debt, those scholars and students of rhetoric and composition,
most of whom I know only through the written word in publication, were really my mentors
before this project began.
Of all the people he has cited.
If I have slated anyone, if I have slated anyone, it is annoyingly because composition
is just emerging as a serious discipline, the standards for scholarly achievement and
recognition are not as clear as in literary studies, thus we often borrow concept strategies
and teaching techniques without being aware of their sources.
Thus we often borrow concepts, strategies and teaching techniques without being aware
of their sources.
If any of you recognize material that I have unwittingly taken from you, you should accept
this highest form of flattery, along with my sincere apology, for not publicly recognizing
you.
Finally, I would like to acknowledge my debt to Aristotle, though it seems foolish, so
to acknowledge, so to try to pay homage to the thinker, who almost single-handedly invented
western civilization.
Although it seems foolish to acknowledge, my debt to Aristotle, though it seems foolish
to try to pay homage to the thinker, probably still the wisest and most useful source of
knowledge about rhetoric.
I also owe an intellectual and practical debt to my students, who have, through the years,
inspired and challenged me.
I would like to thank especially those who allowed me to use their work in my textbook.
Okay, and the text begins here.


# REC054.txt
All right, so a red brick again, just stay okay at the beginning of the text, I'm gonna
read this bit, no, no, there was some art, that was awesome, okay, so the thing of red
brick, there's an image here, it's kind of abstract, apparently this has been, this is the
thing throughout the book, it's really clever, you kind of get to read the text as you go,
that's weird, examine interest, purposes, purposes in the mind, conceptual level,
organization, organization, he says, integrating, three major, integrating, three major
discussion, oh boy, theory, okay, it was better the first time I read it, because I've read
this before, and it was really cool, framework thought, examining, developing, overviews,
styles, communication, work, and leisure, precipit, because you had to read this out so
naturally, it was cool, and this book, I'll take a picture of that one for sure,


# REC055.txt
the process of rhetoric. A human problem.
Your congressman is a public servant.
Oh man, because man. Wait, there is more to it. What happened?
What am I supposed to do?


# REC056.txt
found it. Okay, this is the important text. The three appeals. The three appeals. If you were a congressman, if you were, okay, this is an example text. If you were a politician that citizens would go to influence, and you had no prior commitment to vote either way on a bill, what would commit you to act in a particular way?
What do we convey in the earlier text? Which rhetorical method was most effective in people's talking to you to make you sway a certain way, based on the identity of the writer and based on the appeals to the evidence in the case, or that based on your emotional response?
It's okay. There is, of course, no right answer. Whatever direction a citizen takes, there is no right answer in their appeals to a politician.
It's a discernible truth, a discernible best outcome. If you relate these circumstances to people, otherwise it's a... don't want to call it.
Yeah, no, there's too many twisted economic drives, tied up into the decisions we would make. Then the personal quarrel, the personal stakes that anyone, senator, congressman or, let's say, how a representative would have to lobby for their efforts?
They have personal intentions to mitigate in discourse. It's like, how do they make appeals? I wonder, how do they make these? What do they spend time discussing?
The emails? It's good, no.


# REC057.txt
back to the text, so there is no, there is of course no right answer
whichever of the three appeals you make in way of
oh boy, hang on, it'll come to describe it again
I need this text, some of you will respond one way
some another and another is still a third way
and any one of these approaches can be effective
and effective, a truth that was once
recognized by the Greek philosopher
Aristotle, about 25 years, 20 or 20 years, 25 centuries ago
Aristotle, Aristotle, analyzed the rhetorical situation
any situation in which one person communicates
with another as having three components
one, a speaker or writer
they have what themselves
or their expression in speaking or writing
and all those other components
an audience or reader, two, an audience or reader
in the act of oration or in the act of writing
you consider the audience or the reader
and three, a message or content, so what are you trying to convey
in the text
or content? Aristotle classified rhetorical means
according to what element in the rhetorical situation was
most prominent, thus if a speaker
writer emphasized his own character
he called it ethos, Aristotle called this appeal
Ethical appeal
if the speaker emphasized, hang on, hang on, I'm going to read the text
if a speaker or writer emphasized his own character
ethos, you would call it ethos
I don't think I can't
Aristotle called this appeal, Ethical appeal
if the speaker emphasized the emotions of the audience
the appeal, Ethical appeal


# REC058.txt
That's where he and otherwise anyone who listens to this is going to have a hard time.
Shit. Okay. Thus, if a speaker were right or emphasized his own character, ethos,
Aristotle, Aristotle called this appeal the ethical appeal.
If the speaker emphasized the emotions of the audience, he called this the emotional appeal.
If the speaker emphasized the content, the actual truth about the subject, he called this the rational appeal,
which is really the best, which is which of these is really best, is the best to use.
Interestingly enough, Aristotle said that the rational approach was the ideal method for rhetoric.
But he said that the ethical or personal appeal was the most effective.
However, he spent much more effort on analyzing emotional appeals than he did on analyzing the other two appeals.
So Aristotle couldn't seem to actually decide on an answer any more than we can.
There's no one exposed to the answer. It's a combination of all those appeals.
He spent a lot of time doing emotional appeals because that was the bulk of those relational systems.
Systems, he would have to demonstrate ability in within. Otherwise, he wouldn't have function to discourse as he did.
So an object, an objection, I am.


# REC059.txt
and objection and a response.
Now some of you will probably object to this inconclusiveness.
You will argue that people are supposed to be rational, reasonable, and logical creatures.
You may also think that appealing to someone's emotions is a way of deceiving him, as it
often is in the real world.
And you have probably been taught in your class and in other books on writing.
The logical writing is good, and emotional writing is bad.
I will try to answer these objections as fairly and honestly as I can.
First, rhetoric is the study of human communication as it is, not as it ought to be.
Indeed, first rhetoric, rhetoric is the study of human communication as it is, not as
it ought to be.
Indeed, if people were computers, or angels, or creatures of pure reason and logic, there
would be no need for rhetoric.
Pure logic would serve us all very well, but we are, but we are, we all recognize that
people have emotions as well as reason.
Secondly, rhetoric does not exclude, rhetoric does not exclude reason and logic.
It merely recognizes reason and logic are not always sufficient, either to make a person
respond to you as you wish him to, or to get him to act as you wish him to.
How many times have you argued about politics with your father and uncle?
No matter how logical your arguments seem to be, they never change their opinions.
They, too, are probably amazed at your failure to respond to their logic.
Thirdly, how many times have you argued about politics with your father and uncle?
No matter how logical your arguments seem to be, they never change their opinions.
They, too, are probably amazed at your failure to respond to their logic.
Thirdly, you would never have their theory of mind, unless they, their reasoning is not,
they, their reasoning is not, is only sound to them, unless they would, it would extrapolate well enough to yours.
Yeah, there's a definite common thread, but no, another word, neither of you would take, take accounting.
Take, take, take stance to reason out that, that for that long.
Thirdly, rhetoric recognizes that emotional appeals have their validity, validity, validity, validity, too.
No one can, I mean, you have to, if they can't, if they can't, if they can't be humbled,
then you're not going to come to any conclusion, and they may just like storm off.
If you don't, if you don't ask, you'll never know.
You don't say, give return to, give return, give return away with joy.
Where is your fucking joy?
Thirdly, rhetoric, rhetoric recognizes that emotional appeals have their validity, have their validity, too.
No one can prove with facts or logic that it is absolutely better to be an American, for an American, to have a job, then for a Saudi, Saudi, Saudi Arabian, to have that job.
But Americans are, in fact, more concerned about an unemployment in America than in other countries.
Such a bias is emotional, but quite natural and normal.
I should also point out that, okay, one more time for that one, because that, thirdly, rhetoric recognizes that emotional appeals have their validity, too.
No one can prove with facts or logic that it is absolutely better for an American to have a job, then for a Saudi, better for an American to have a job, then for a Saudi, Saudi Arabian, to have that job.
But Americans are, in fact, concerned about, but Americans are, in fact, more concerned about unemployment in America than in other countries.
Such a bias is emotional, but quite natural and normal.
I should also point out that the ethical appeal, which is not strictly logical, is one that often works to our advantage.
We must trust the advice of parents, teachers, priests, ministers, lawyers, counselors, and friends, especially if we don't have any reasonable knowledge about the subject.
For example, if a friend says, the movie that I watched really sucked, we will probably go to some other movie, or to no movie at all.
If a lawyer tells us, don't sign the contract, it's too full of loopholes, we probably won't sign.
We trust the character of the speaker, even though we may not understand why.
That's a normal part of, he says, that's a normal part of living.
Rhetoric, then, is the study of how audiences are affected, whether by emotion, reason, or trust in the character of the speaker.
Rhetoric, rhetoric, or a rhetoric, rhetoric, rhetorician, IE, one skilled in rhetoric, evaluates a speech or a piece of writing in accordance to how effectively a speaker or writer communicates certain opinions or information to an audience.
Either one person or either one person or a group, in a certain situation.

So standards of rhetoric, standards of rhetorical effectiveness, the explanation in the preceding paragraph seems clear enough, but it also seems pretty vague.
How can we tell anyone to respond to any appeal in a situation?
The explanation in preceding paragraph seems clear enough, but it also seems clear enough.
The explanation in preceding paragraph seems clear enough.


# REC061.txt
standards of rhetorical effectiveness. The explanation in the preceding paragraph seems
clear enough, but it also seems pretty vague. How can we tell how anyone will respond to
any appeals in any situation? Isn't that just a hit or miss procedure in which we are
more likely to hit miss than to hit? Oh my god. Alright, one more time.


# REC062.txt
The standards of rhetorical effectiveness.
The explanation in the preceding paragraph seems clear enough, but also seems pretty vague.
Go to the room.
Oh man.
Okay, I'm so distracted.
Cat, you're adorable.
Why you gotta be cute?
What are you doing playing like that?


# REC063.txt
The standards of rhetorical effectiveness.
The explanation in the preceding paragraph seems clear enough, but it also seems pretty
vague.
How can we tell anyone who will respond to any appeals in any situation?
Any situation.
Isn't that just a hit or miss procedure in which we're more likely to miss than to hit?
Or to put the question more generally and abstractly, can there be any system to rhetoric
where rhetoric deals with the whims of human personality?
To answer that question, let's consider what may be a familiar situation for you and
many other college students.
Suppose you need $50 for a weekend skiing or surfing or just having a blast.
When you have a strategy for asking your parents for some money, perhaps you write to your
father at his office, or you may telephone your mother, or you may telephone your mother.
And when do you know your father won't be home?
Or perhaps you write to tell how hard you've been studying.
Or perhaps you write to tell how hard you've been studying, something that's shown by
the A's on your last three exams and explain how you really need some relaxation.
In other words, you do have a rhetorical strategy, a plan for presenting your rhetorical
strategy, a plan for presenting your character, and your case in the best possible light for
your audience.
Now this example of asking a parent for money is a rhetorical model.
In the sense that effectiveness of rhetoric is a rhetorical model.
Now this example of asking a parent for money is a rhetorical model in the sense that
effectiveness of the rhetoric is pretty easy to judge.
If you get the money, your rhetoric has been effective.
If you don't get the money, your rhetoric has been ineffective.
That's a pretty easy situation to evaluate.
However, it is not always so easy to judge the effectiveness of our rhetoric because
our rhetorical goal is not always an action or an objective result.
Often our goal in writing is not to get somebody to do something, not to get somebody to do
something.
We may want merely to explain something to someone, or we may want someone to sympathize
with us, or we may want our audience to think more carefully about our subject, or you
may just be meandering to say on something, you didn't mean to say on.
A work of rhetoric must be judged in relation to its purpose.


# REC064.txt
A text book, oh hey more time, a work of rhetoric must be judged in relation to its
part, to its, but no, a work of rhetoric must be judged in relation to its purpose.
A text book is relationally, is, is, oh man, a text book is rhetorically effective if
students learn from it.
A text book is rhetorically effective if students learn from it.
The book must contain accurate information and must present that information clearly
and in a well-organized pattern.
Okay, accuracy is, that's, right, difficulty, but, I think we are definitely missing
a rhetorical baseline for knowledge in way of teaching, in a way of learning.
We have not been so afforded all those baseline assets of human communication and, well,
we're given the fundamentals of, of, rigor, rigor learning, but not the so fundamentals
of relational learning.

Okay, so just continuing from, I don't know where that, okay, middle of the text somewhere.
A letter of condolence is effective if it represents your emotions about the deceased
while offering comfort to the, to the bereaved.
A poem is effective if it's readers, if it's readers, readers, if it's readers,
whoever they might, might happen to be, enjoy the poem.
The standards of rhetorical effectiveness for a personal, for personal letters intended
for a friend may differ from those for a poem, for a poem, for a poem intended
for the public.
Present and those and to come, present and to come, and the standards will differ for
an ad, and the standards, and the standards will differ for an ad that is intended to sell
a product, and a letter that seeks to tell a close friend that you were thinking about
him, and then you care about him.
However, however, the ultimate standard of rhetoric is still the same.
You will want to know whether your message had the, had the effect you wanted it to on
your audience, that is the heart of rhetoric and the rhetorical method.
As a matter of fact, you and I and those around us have been practicing, have been practicing
rhetoric all our lives.
For most of our lives, you've known for a long time that you don't talk to the family
minister the same way you talk to your kids sister, and you know that you don't deal
with a college, English professor, the same way you deal with your mother.
A lot of you, like he says in quotations, a lot of you have probably already discovered,
a lot of you have probably already discovered, perhaps to your dismay, that you can't deal
with the college professors in the same way that you deal with high school teachers.
Because you've been practicing rhetoric all your life, the formal study of rhetoric won't
be too difficult for you.
The formal study of rhetoric won't be too difficult for you.
Because you've been practicing, because you've been, it's good text.


# REC066.txt
Because you've been practicing, oh man, because you've been practicing rhetoric all your life, the formal study of rhetoric won't be too difficult for you.
Because you've been practicing rhetoric all your life, the formal study of rhetoric, the formal study of...
Because you've been practicing rhetoric, oh man, because you've been practicing rhetoric all your life, the formal study of rhetoric won't be too difficult for you.
The chief difference, the chief difference, the chief difference will be that your study of rhetoric will now be more systematic and rigid.
You will be asked to think more carefully and edit and edit BFFB you will be asked to think more carefully and analytically about your rhetorical decisions.
These few examples have probably been enough to show that there is a method rather.
Most of the rest of the book will deal with the method without a problem in the fight.
You're writing more effectively.
However, before doing anything else, let's get back to our original problem.
So, in writing a letter to a congressman, so to demonstrate, you're wanting of them to decide on an issue.
So, this person's name is...
This person is Wilbur D. Fairweather.
So, deciding an issue.
How will congressmen Wilbur D. Fairweather vote on the Honey Import, their legislation?
This legislation, the Honey Import Act.
How should he vote? What appeals will persuade him?
On most political issues, we hope that...
Ah, come on. You need the full context.
That's the two points. I don't read it again.
I don't read it again.
Okay, let's try this one.


# REC067.txt
The thing is to try. Write a letter to your congressman or senator on an issue you feel
strong about. When you receive his reply to your letter, analyze the appeals that he
uses in his letter. Look at some ads on television, horror magazines, and newspapers, and analyze
which appeals they emphasize. Read the letters to the read, the letters to the editor, column
in a newspaper or magazine, using her own intuitive responses as guides, as guides.
Evaluate the letter by putting them in numeric order with one for the best, two for the second
best, and so forth. Then try to analyze the letter to see if you can discover the reasons
for your responses. Writing assignments. In doing any writing assignments, it must be a useful
rhetorical exercise to list the following information at the beginning of your paper. Subject
and one is subject to his audience. Characteristics. Three is speaker description. Four is rhetorical
goal. Four is rhetorical goal. Five is rhetorical strategy. Here, for instance, is a simple plan
for the first assignment below. Subject. Increase in, okay, let's say a subject. Increase
in state income tax. Two is audience. State Senator Jones. A conservative. Three is speaker.
A mildly angry. A mildly angry. But still reasonable citizen. Four is rhetorical goal. To
get Senator Jones to vote against the bill. Five is rhetorical strategy. To show that
budget cuts could be made to avoid this increased tax. One. Write a substantial letter on
the controversial issue as though you were going to send it to a public official, a newspaper
or a magazine. Write a letter to your teacher for sweating him that you shouldn't have to
do. Two do one of these writing, writing assignments. Okay.

I don't believe it took me 45 minutes to get here, and I was only 3 miles away, I don't
believe it took me 45 minutes, they're complaining, never mind, it never fails, I always managed
to get the teriyaki sauce on my Thai, I at least highlights the design, this food looks
so good, I am glad I forgot to eat lunch.
The first disclosures should be generally positive, generally positive.
Some time ago I attended a luncheon meeting, a luncheon, a luncheon meeting for a professional
association, and said hello to one of the officers, when I asked how he was, he mentioned
his separation, then he elaborated on his teenage children's questions about his love
life, and his sex life, and I realized that he needed to talk to someone, but that meeting
was neither the right time nor the right place, and I was not the right person.
Food is always a wonderful basis for communication, grandma knew that food was a great conversation
starter, that's one reason she made it, made lots of it, it's no accident that meetings
get together, social engagements, and family affairs are often centered around a meal,
when people come together over food, a certain amount of nurturing takes place, at least on
the physical level, and often at the mental and professional levels as well, you know,
flirting, flirting, and while we're on the subject of great lines, what about 30, what
about the words, body language, facial expressions and glances that can find their way from
a purely social situation to a business setting or vice versa, what about the words, body
language, facial expressions and glances that can find their way from a purely social situation
to a business setting or vice versa, to some, flirting is a way of exchanging friendly
banter, very much like small talk, good nature friendly banter is fine and can be appropriate
even in the office, to others, to others, flirting is a come-on and it depends on the flirty,
the flirty, the flirty and on what is actually, and on what is actually being said and done,
use caution, with flirting, use caution with flirting in a business setting, one person's
small talk is another person's come-on, ask yourself if you want that deal or that promotion,
writing on what, writing on what someone thinks of you as a business associate or as a potential
date, strategy 6.
Moving in, breaking and entering, there is a difference between including yourself and other
people's conversations and intruding on them, getting into a conversation that is already
underway requires a dose of shitspa but also some sensitivity, watch people's body language
and listen to the tone of their conversation for clues, one of my clients offers this advice
for including without intruding, avoid approaching two people who look as though they are having
an intense conversation, if they seem, if they seem totally preoccupied, you can assume
that they are flirting with some profound ideas or with one another.
Approach groups of three or more, position yourself close to the group, give only facial
feedback to the comment being made, when you feel yourself being included, either by verbal
acknowledgement or by eye contact, you are free to join in the conversation.
Be open to others who want in, when you see someone on the periphery of your conversational
group, remember how uncomfortable you feel in that situation, that's good, that's very
good.
If you merely want to extend, if you merely want to extend a greeting to someone in the
conversation, you might say, excuse me for interrupting, but I wanted to say hello,
then move away, you may find that your interruption is a welcome relief and that you are invited
to stay in chat.
If you merely want to extend a greeting to someone in the conversation, you might say, excuse
me for interrupting, but I wanted to say hello, then move away, you may find that your
interruption is a welcome relief and that you are invited to stay in chat.
What if someone interrupts your intents or inborn conversation?
According to Dr. Geraldine Alpert, a psychologist in Marion County, North of San Francisco, you
can be both firm, you can be both firm and gracious, acknowledge the person politely
and thank them for saying hello, indicate that you need to finish this conversation, but
we'll catch up with them later, then do so.
Strategy 7, moving on, extricating yourself, many of us feel uncomfortable,
with ending a conversation, someone, somewhere, told us that it was rude, actually, the etiquette
of cocktail parties is that we are supposed to circulate.
No less than authority then mismanners suggest that we spend no more than 8-10 minutes with
anyone person.
We have been invited so that we can mingle and meet other attendees.
It is an opportunity to circulate among peers, colleagues, potential clients, and to meet
as many people as possible.
The idea is not to engage in conversation with one person for the duration, although
we sometimes do that because it can be easier.
So that's good, 8-10 minutes, that's great, that's a good goal.
Now today it's more like 4 minutes, can I have 4 minutes your time to talk on things,
not 10 minutes, it's too much, 4 minutes is probably a good time because if it turns out
that I'm talking to you, they'll talk to you more.
If you wanted to get to know everybody on a school campus, you wanted to get to know everyone
in your office, you wanted to get to know everyone in your factory, if you wanted to
unionize.
Can I talk to you for 4 minutes?
We might have alignment on things you'd be surprised about.
It turns out we're actually pretty similar, 70-some percent of people would not want to
see, but the Democrats really think it's general consensus that we don't want to see
Biden run again, it's not going to be you.
We got a Marianne Williamson, Marianne Williamson will save us, Marianne Williamson,
Marianne Williamson, say your name, say your name, so, yeah, thank you, I'll fetch
right that, Marianne, Marianne Williamson, Marianne Williamson,
Marianne Williamson, Marianne Williamson, Marianne Williamson, Marianne Williamson,


# REC071.txt
Try to emulate Aristotle, Aristotle classified rhetorical means according to which elements in the rhetorical situation was most prominent.
Thus if a speaker or writer emphasized his own character, ethos, Aristotle, Aristotle called this appeal the ethical appeal.
If the speaker emphasized the emotions of the audience, he called this appeal the emotional appeal.
If the speaker emphasized the content, the actual truth about the subject, he called this the rational appeal, the rational appeal, which is really which he says which is really best to use.
Interestingly enough, Aristotle said that the rational approach was the ideal method for rhetoric, but he said that the ethical appeal, the ethical or personal appeal, was the most effective.
However, he spent much more effort on analyzing emotional appeals than he did on analyzing the other two appeals.
So Aristotle couldn't seem to actually decide on an answer any more than we can.
So in the next section, an objection and a response.
Now some of you will probably object to this inconclusiveness, you will argue that people are supposed to be rational, reasonable, reasonable, and logical creatures.
You may also think that appealing to someone's emotions is a way of deceiving him, as it is often in the real world.
And you have probably been taught in your class and in other books on writing, on writing, that logical writing is good, and that emotional writing is bad.
I will try to answer these objections as fairly as, as fairly and honestly as I can.
First, rhetoric is the study of human communication as it is, not as it ought to be.
And indeed, if people were computers, or angels, or just creatures of pure reason and logic, there would be no need for rhetoric.
Pure logic would serve us all very well, but we all recognize that people have emotions as well as reason.
Secondly, rhetoric does not exclude reason and logic.
It really recognizes that reason and logic are not always sufficient, either to make a person respond as you wish him to, or to get him to act as you wish him to.
How many times have you argued about politics with your father and uncle?
No matter how logical your arguments seem to be, they never change their opinions.
They too are probably amazed at your failure to respond to their logic.
Thirdly, rhetoric recognizes that emotional appeals have their validity too.
No one can prove with facts or logic that it is absolutely impossible to respond to.
Thirdly, rhetoric recognizes that emotional appeals have their validity too.
No one can prove with facts or logic that it is absolutely better for an American to have a job and then for a Saudi Arabian to have that job, but Americans are, in fact, more concerned about unemployment in America than in other countries.
Such a bias is emotional but quite natural and normal.
I should also point out that the ethical appeal, which is not strictly logical, is one that works to our advantage.
We trust the advice of parents, teachers, priests, ministers, lawyers, counselors, and friends, especially if we don't have any reasonable knowledge about the subject.
For example, if a close friend says, the movie I watched really sucked, we will probably go to some other movie or no movie at all.
If a lawyer tells us, don't sign the contract, it's too full of loopholes, we probably won't sign.
We trust the character of the speaker, even though we may not understand why.
That's a normal part of living.
For rhetoric, then, is the study of how audiences are affected, whether by emotion, reason, or trust in the character of the speaker.
Or rhetoric, or rhetorician, rhetorician, rhetorician, rhetorician, rhetoric, or rhetorician, i.e. one skilled in rhetoric.
If evaluates a speech or a piece of writing, according to a affective speaker or a rhetoric communicates certain opinions or information to an audience, either one person or a group, in a certain situation.
Either one person or a group, I mean, he doesn't mention the active cello, so a little acquies though.
Just saying one's going to court, reason out for the unit first, no direct audience.
You can imagine having a recording device to parse one's ideas.

The explanation in the preceding paragraph seems clear enough, but it also seems pretty vague.
How can we tell how anyone will respond to any appeals in any situation?
Isn't that just a hit or miss procedure in which we're more likely to miss than to hit?
Isn't that just a hit or miss procedure in which we're more likely to miss than to hit?
Almost, but no, damn dude. Or to put the question more generally and abstractly.
Can there be any system or to system to rhetoric when rhetoric deals with the whims of human personality?
To answer that question, let's consider what may be a familiar situation for you and many other college students.
Suppose you need $50 for a weekend skiing or surfing or just having a blast. I read that already though.


# REC073.txt
okay so chapter 2 chapter 2 chapter 2 and sounding myself chapter 2 what's
up with you content rhetorical writing the types of writing I need to
practice out being louder damn it that's what time is it ten o'clock okay
content rhetorical writing the types of writing that this book will deal
with will be the types that you as an educated person will be expected to
use both in your classes and more important beyond the classroom we will
look at types of writing that you will use as employee manager college
student citizen with a citizen in a democracy and consumer and citizen
and citizen where is the citizen thing we are citizens first and consumer my
okay citizen in a democracy yeah but you should put that above consumer
with that okay I mean come on yeah consumer the major under under capitalism
yeah we are consumers but we can produce we can we can produce in ways that
are not so tied to this thing in the economy the major kinds of writing that
you will probably be doing are okay on dammit


# REC074.txt
The major kinds of writing that you will probably be probably be doing are persuasion and exposition
Persuasion is the attempt to change or strengthen an audience audience's opinion to agree with you or yours
For instance, you may want to persuade your boss that your plan for cutting costs in the shipping department
Is better than any of the other proposals that have been offered
Or you may want to persuade a politician like Congressman Fairweather in the former examples
To support your views
Exposition is explaining or clarifying what something means or how it works
You may have to explain to your psychology professor
That a term like defense mechanism
Well, like what a term like defense mechanism means
Or you may or you may have to explain to a group of employees
whom you supervise
Just how the new grievances just how the new grievance grievance procedure will work
yoi
Caps and points and and severance
For both practical and theoretical reasons
This book will not concentrate on writing either
Imagine it imaginative literature
poems novels oh, oh, oh, dang nice to hell yes
For both practical and theoretical reasons this book will not concentrate on either
And it will not, huh?
Okay, well, okay, shit. I don't know. I've no idea what to expect yet. I didn't kind of glance at everything
Okay


# REC075.txt
For both practical and theoretical reasons, this book will not concentrate on writing either imaginative, literature, poems, novels, short stories in place, nor on those purely personal forms of writing that all of us manage to write pretty adequately.
Personal letters, diaries, love letters, and so forth. Nor will the book deal extensively with descriptive writing. Word pictures of persons, places, or things, or narrative writing, the telling of a series of events in a story form.
Although as rhetoric, rhetoricians, remain used various techniques and devices, from all these forms of writing and the support of a phrase.


# REC076.txt
Wait what
Okay, okay, let's just start here
Among the among the proper subjects for rhetoric are our matter of proper subjects
A matter is a policy matters of a pro-opposed future action like the honey. Okay. Yeah
I don't know when a writer urges a okay god damn it
Okay
Okay, fine when a writer urges a public official to vote for a bill a
Citizen to vote for a candidate or or a consumer to buy a product. He is engaging in deliberative
rhetoric
Our rhetoric
rhetoric about a future about future action a
A
A more extended form of deliberative deliberative rhetoric would be an extended essay
In a magazine
arguing that the United States should concentrate its resources
on developing solar rather than nuclear energy
Or or an editorial in a newspaper might argue that marijuana should be legalized or that the legal aged
Legal age for both drinking and voting should be raised
231. Oh, are you okay the extreme of bad? Yeah, don't don't don't do that
that
But yes vote then make him make it. Yeah, and that's good good awesome rhetoric dude. I love that shit
The distinguishing marks of deliberative rhetoric are that it concerns the future and and that it seeks actions
From the audience rather than mere agreement boy one more time
The distinguishing marks of deliberative rhetoric are that it concerns the future and that it seeks actions
From the audience rather than mere agreement
Good good dude
The language of
Okay, I like that though. Oh my god
It seeks actions seeks actions from the audience rather than mere agreement
seeks actions
The the language of deliberative rhetoric the language of deliberative rhetoric often uses should or ought as key words
What should we ought to do what ought we to do what we what what is our what is our principal action?
What what what ought we to see value and what should we see value and doing?
As the key words
deliberative rhetoric often uses should or ought as key words
Another proper subject for rhetoric is past action
What took place in the past
When jurors in a courtroom consider the evidence in a
In a case
They are attempting to decide what took place in the past as a matter of fact the development development of rhetoric
in ancient
Athens got great impetus from the need of citizens to defend themselves in court
rhetoric that deals with judgment about the past is called judicial rhetoric or forensic rhetoric
Besides strictly legal matters judicial rhetoric might consider whether
Columbus was the first first year for
That was the first year for European to come to America whether we are the Ivy Harvey Oswald
Act alone in killing John F. Kennedy or whether Shakespeare was a woman
Many historical and literary read literary research articles and papers are examples of of of judicial rhetoric
Okay, like
All right, you think things you'd find agreement on to but Columbia. I've got that's kind of suck, dude. You'd say that though
Fuck on this
Unlike unlike deliberative rhetoric judicial rhetoric does not necessarily imply action
We can read out with that. All right. That was just a common example. That was a good example. That was a common
Yeah, right. You're not doing bad dear dear writer. You're doing good
Unlike deliberative. I just hate that that was the example. I want to one is named the spirit mystery
Unlike deliberative rhetoric judicial rhetoric judicial rhetoric does not necessarily imply action
We can read convincing arguments. We can read read read we can read a convincing argument that
Lee of Eric Lee of Erickson came to America before
Lee of Erickson came to Columbus before Columbus. They came to America. What the fuck came to America before Columbus?
Unlike deliberative rhetoric judicial rhetoric does not necessarily imply action
We can read a convincing argument that Lee of Erickson came to America before before that dude
But we are content with merely knowing we are not we are very content with really knowing this information
We have we have we have no great desire to do anything with the information
I
Could I could contest you I could say hey neither one of those dudes discovered it
um
You go you go further right to say more of the stuff, please
We feel no need to go out and to and and decorate statues
Statues of Columbus
You ask now you you were a colonist you fucking idiot
We feel no need to grow and decorate statues of Columbus
Dude that's wild
Of course some judicial judgments may lead to action
But the action is really separate from the judgment itself
Well we we couldn't we couldn't give you any any more judicial judgment
via the on your text because the author is so disposed
Well that's just that's just I mean you were saying earlier with you were saying earlier with uh
With uh
uh, Eric Stettelstuff him being dead you can't you can't really know his his uh
With rhetorical reason
You can't you can't further extract it on the on the reason that was presented
um
Okay, I'm kind of useless to argue with the dead with it with with
uh, the death of the author um, but okay


# REC077.txt
Whether subjects deal with the present are a whole new class of subjects for rhetoric or
whether they are merely forms of deliberative and judicial rhetoric is perhaps unclear.
Nevertheless, we do argue at such issues as whether the incumbent president is an effective
leader whether the whether whether whether that's a good example whether whether
whether mentor a mental mental telepathy is a reality whether life exists elsewhere
on a universe okay that that one is discernible though you could you could you could
do mathematics for that the other one is a fiction and whether our national defense is sufficiently
strong okay I see the judgment about about the president in our first example can only be
made based on the based on the past so it might be considered judicial judicial rhetoric the
judgment about the national defense probably the judgment about the national defense probably
probably points to policy decisions so it might be considered deliberative deliberative
deliberative but questions about mental telepathy often or life elsewhere in the universe are clearly
about the the present state of things and do not immediately and do not immediately imply
any action okay the the pink your corn in my attic is named Steve you could not say he does not
exist he is he is my best friend this person Steve this this this pink your her name Steve
and in the text so the the fiction is the fiction being disposed is not of consequence but if
it's a fiction that is common then it is of consequence in the in the in the secular nature
of our of our legislative body to keep keep the pink your corn name Steve out of politics


# REC078.txt
But you totally can discern the, you can mathematically predict that there might be life.
We couldn't know for sure.
I wish we couldn't.
For one to a better term, we can call them subjects of rhetorical, of theoretical rhetoric.
Nice.
The probabilities for or against the existence of life elsewhere in the universe, in the
universe can be argued intelligently, until factual verification is possible, until and
if.
I so hope that we will.
If the sun, if the earth has been around for 4.5 billion years, and our universe has
been around for 13.8, and say the life of our star will last at least another billion
years.
We can hypothetically extend it into the trillions, if we impose greater technologies to things
of starlifting, and we can reserve all the energy and reduce the mass of the sun to keep
it burning for indefinite period, or we can totally rely on a fusion energy now, fusion
energy as it's being developed.
So we'll see how it goes, because we have, and it's such an abundance of hydrogen in these
basic elements, that we can go on for as long as we see fit to remain under the care of
our star.
Yeah, and you can argue a lot of those things.
And you can not, bye.

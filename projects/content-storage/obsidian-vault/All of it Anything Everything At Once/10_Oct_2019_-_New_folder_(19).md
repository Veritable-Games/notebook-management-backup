Um, you need to be properly what you can use.
So imagine if you're gonna scope.
Yeah.
Scope is a big issue for all these games.
It takes start if they do too much, and they go well.
So I think for scope in terms of production and cost,
we could hire like, a few experts at the time,
and then those experts can be characters,
whatever, in some regards, or like,
you can act at, we have a huge select characters, right?
But we don't mean, like characters,
okay, you have the main NPCs,
the ones you talk to a lot, the close friends,
per se, in the main hub.
Oh, I see what you mean,
you can talk about before the actual character doesn't exist.
Yeah, yeah, the actual characters.
So then you have, from there, you have,
so one of the reasons you draw is,
it's that all of your, at the learning.
Well, the learning, yeah, the player is learning.
The player is, the player is.
You have it that, um,
I said this 12 emotions per act.
Yeah, 12 the, I told you,
I told you I called them, um, affects.
Well, so you could run in, like,
or dodex, or affect, yeah.
You know when you're born, think of it as like going to English.
Apple Street English is broken, you know, you know what it means, but you can always speak.
So that's where the whole R2D2, R2D2, Bastion thing comes in, like you have like very simple
beeps at first and you have more complex ones, just to get the scope minimal, so because
that's a lot of ways to minimize the understanding.
Yeah, and you have the actual actors and they, okay, so to kind of articulate what
the system is and how it looks and engine, you have one conversation in dialogue, right?
You record this expert, you give them time to talk, experts, maybe have people different,
two different philosophers, two different people talking to each other, right?
Yeah, the recording.
And then you record it like, you know, three, four minutes, however long the conversation
seems to persist.
Yeah.
You don't talk forever.
So that's fine.
No, he's looking at the spot, you're going to be using it, I'll right back, he's
looking at it, he's looking at it, he's looking at it, he's looking at it, he's looking

~~What if we set our workshop, what if I release this game without steam, what if I did~~
~~it, individually, or used to goch or inch? But do they have a workshop style? I imagine~~
~~I have, I release the game, it does not have workshop first, and I release all platforms~~
~~ideally, but then the website has a system of creation and creation content that got a~~
~~form of people with creating stuff. So the biggest issue of that is the submit stuff and~~
~~the integration of the game. Well, I just, if they did the model, how would they make it,~~
~~how are you going to bring it to the game? How am I going to, I just actually did create a~~
~~model and I put it into the engine, or you know where it is. Now we have to patch it every~~
~~copy of that game. Yeah, so I've got to keep the scope small and can't be too large~~
~~in asset, but SBI sets that are worth buying to the player's mind. So say we have~~
~~a home decorating, right? This is again, this is far off, this is stretchable, this is~~
~~out of scope for now. But imagine you're designing the interior of this house, and~~
~~you can choose what the house is, and the model is obviously not big and so you have a few~~
~~different options, and you get more options at a time.~~ Imagine you're decorating this home,
and you buy things to decorate it with, and then out of scope again, but if you would
buy your friends over the home, you know, it's like a, and then you go out and explore
with them. Well, it's about possession. You ought to be careful, I haven't too much buying
stuff. Well, this would be grabbed up on a failure or not and paid a wedding scheme.
No, no, it's not paid a wedding, so it's paid a donate. No, people will accuse that.
Well, let's be able to actually make clear that the artist is 30%, we only get 20%.
It's meant to be a platform, but that's the hiding, that you're going to hide in content
behind the paywall. That's something you're going to be careful about.
But what if I produce content? I'm not going to call that. I produce content.
I have free content. You're going to, as soon as you build a paid workshop, that's what
is going to be accused. Can I keep you going?
Can I keep you going? It's purely content.
No, keep knowing the boxes. You're just buying furniture up. It's a cosmetic thing.
We explicitly state we'll be copied if you need it. Or if you get people like on
Patreon, you don't want to care like this kind of idea, but imagine
you have a patron of this. What do you think the decision is just
getting it all together? Yeah. What are you going to congregate all these?
On the upside, of course. They submit to them.
There's only so much on my website that can handle it. No, but it's about to have
a decent database.
Most of the biggest thing that kills most of the developers
is overexpansion. Yeah, I've got to be careful. Scope is the biggest thing. Scope
creepy, killed note, killed a...
That one game, that one sci-fi game with...
Not...
Goddamn it.
It's been built for seven years. A long time, three years, four years.
25.
Star Citizen.
Oh, that's why it's still...
Yeah, because the creator, he's like, oh, this sounds cool. We have money now.
Oh, let's do that. He gets over the excited.
I know where I'm scytheed that, but then they fixed themselves.
But you go down the road. So I think the balance between that is like...
Self-funded.
Like, uh...
Star Citizen, but you're scoped with them inside.
You know what Sky Citizen is large?
I can handle the update that they have.
Now that I have cash for this, I'll throw a money over this, so they're expanding content.
A bit, a bit, a bit, a little bit, though, not...
Not like huge updates, but...
Oh, that over time.
Do you have a cell phone charger?
Inside.
I mean, look, that's the needs, like, maybe teething, but it's...
I don't know what kind of...
Just a vehicle, like, uh...
Well, then the same as the X on, the charger.
Okay, yeah, they can charge you in there.
If you want to get started, I'm going to switch work on it.
You can carry that on.
Or not, if you want.
Oh, work on it.
What would you want to store it for?
It is the course.
And what did that restart for?
Okay.
So, okay, all right.
I can charge...
So, I'm trying to figure out what we could do here.
Okay.
So, let's just start now.
Imagine that you take root.
As the NDI.
So, what was that?
You were never the person.
You weren't the person.
You were the person.
For now, because if you were the person...
Well, because if you...
No, so, you're still not familiar with it from away.
You're more liable to describe detail if you were standing back from the action...
Okay.
So, that's actually not a bad commercial question.
So, I think that that means...
The player has...
They start as a dog, right?
They're absurdists.
They can't even think of that.
I don't mean from a coach, it's one of you.
I mean from an aerator's point of view.
Oh, you don't want to be the action you want to witness it.
The best way to imagine it is you are the third person in the room.
You were merely the third person.
You were in the context of writing, not the story itself.
Yeah.
Okay, so, how would you do about writing?
Let me describe something.
You go about describing it in a literally...
Literally...
Literally...
So, imagine to show off as the dog.
It has taken root.
And at home.
So, I'm taking root outside.
Others take root in homes.
I'm trying to tell them where they are.
They don't know.
It needs regard to this family.
Is there a family?
Yeah, there is one person.
A psychologist.
She...
Does she have family rules and spouses?
Or is it just so?
Not to the player's knowledge.
So, it's always you know it's just so.
As far as you know.
We might add more content.
I don't know how to turn that.
So, for now, just say it's open.
She could have ham and she could not.
Anyway, she...
She is a therapist.
She is a sociologist.
A psychologist.
You're getting caught up too much in the private detail.
Anyway, so...
So, she's in a lounge.
A lounge, bar,
a часть of therapists, office,
agency in general.
Slightly destazilly
with loose homed troop.
Not as exposed.
There's a very conduct.
You take the ideal that you take a moment
in its unmute zone,
if it's Heroic�.
It's ideal to have a time.
A moment for it's just an inspection before you
want to know.
So they have people coming around here.
So there's a divide there?
You're a divide between the room that the one and one such is.
That's an awesome view.
Oh, you can see the door.
Not really, kind of a seat, dude.
It's OK.
No, I thought it's OK.
It's OK.
There's a big, OK-ish.
Translucent, but not.
I don't know if she would.
There's a hospital security class.
Well, a little more, I said it.
Oh, I got an office.
Oh, so it is a security class that, from one side,
you can't see with the other side, you can't.
Yeah, that's not that, actually.
I suppose you can have some glass inside the building itself.
Because a lot of it doesn't look like Okinawa.
OK, reference.
I need to open the space a little bit more
for the pretty glass in front of it.
But, casually, in front of the office, not in front of it.
Two vehicles.
So a lot of offices they hide it by putting it as a wall?
Well, you're not hiding it, do you talk about the wall?
No, it's not like they want it to hide it,
but they put like screens on it.
They said that we thought this, you know,
go in, this is some wall that's opaque.
They put stuff on the wall to get you something to look at.
OK, imagine this.
Imagine you're stepping in the room and then on the actual wall.
You don't actually see the room you see outside.
You see the wall, though, those walls that actually
can shake like an oven.
Psychopaths, which we see now,
they have these electronic walls that change NAR, actually.
So, cheers, these.
I guess that the technology goes into your eyes
and you can see the custom colors and the lighting.
I don't know if you got the set up for that.
Yeah, it's energy efficient, and so,
because you're classified your entire space in N-30.
It's again in the yard, but more than one at all times,
because it's built in here, in your system.
You were talking about the washroom?
Washers?
In a washroom.
In the show, washroom, you see it.
They have this thing, I think it's called the tube,
the bottom right there.
The one?
It's called the tube.
It's an attenuation room.
I kind of like the design of how it does.
It is a box with a rounded top line.
The way that it's lit, it looks like it's going in here.
And it's much more great.
What do you mean by God?
So, it's around now on top of the tube.
It's the floor is lit up with white light,
and so are the walls and the ceiling,
and there's only one thing in the ceiling
that breaks up the whole view.
But when you look at the walls, the way
that they hide the roof with the light
is it looks like it keeps extending out
beyond the room.
It's a visual effect that they tube light in.
That's cool.
That's also visual.
I've got to find that difference.
Are you good, good, good, good?
That's a timestamp, look at it.
I'll figure it out there.
I'll figure it out there.
I'll try to get some timestamps.
There's a lot of stuff there.
Oh, no.
Oh, okay, okay.
I've got a sponge.
There you go.
Oh, it needs to choke.
Oh, yeah, I don't know what to say.
Might as well be fucking beautiful.
If you need a treasure now, should I go in there?
Just a little bit, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I don't know.
It might have been the computer's empty.
Oh, shut up.
No, it's just dead.
Oh, I've got the cord, the school's even seen.
Okay.
I'm gonna run this fan, or shit, we can plug this in
or I can help you when we can't help for a minute.
Yeah, don't worry.
Well, because I've only seen it before,
it might help to get us the sheet of paper.


# REC003.txt
I intend the machine's AEI to be designed this way for a reason.
I'm trying to articulate something, I'm trying to articulate the development of a sentient AI.
You're starting out from simple aggression and anxiety, you're able to go way up to one more complex emotions.
Until you have a full Dodeck.
The full Dodeck of emotion, Dodeck of expression, Dodeck of behavior and intent.
It's not a perfect, it's a more of an abstraction, but it's meant to convey the expressive nature of humans during interactions.
If you learn the language, you can emphasize more without them having to spell it out.
It helps the actors read into the character, play into the character, because they're given an exact direction in terms of their character's motivation and intent and behavior and feelings and such.
Okay, well see you in the way forward.
Dodeck should be secondary to the main story.
You don't even have a war right now.
What color the sky has, we can take a lot of steps back.
Are you skipping a bunch of detail, which is what the storyboarding is?
I know what the world is, the world is Chion.
And Chion is a Chion.
You know what it is.
I need to know what it is.
I need to put it in the game as a document and then we can go from there.
So I can check it out to you guys, the full aspect of the story.
So I think when you hear a story, you're missing trouble putting it.
I like rule building, right?
You like story.
That's why I need you, because you're more inclined to write characters.
I'm more inclined to write world.
If I can do it, you don't even write in the world.
You don't have a war right now.
You have a name.
How much the world didn't know?
What else do you know?
That's what we're going to do in storyboarding.
We're going to have to figure it out.
The color of the soil, the color of the buildings, the color of what people wear, what colors they like.
I've got to use the references to find them better.
I'm not just that.
You've got to build the whole social structure of this entire 20 billion population.
You've got to figure out what other taboo is, what's acceptable, what are social cues.
When they scroll around their chin as I mean, I think it doesn't mean no.
When you're able to hold a sketch in the chin, you have to figure out how they interact.
Do they communicate more with their bodies, or do they vote for communication.
Or it comes off second in populations, well, the simplest way of carrying yourself,
people know something that's on the view, or do they have to invade them.
We've got to figure out foods, social customs around food.
So we've got to define these aspects better.
I think we can work with them.
Because right now all you really have is a scientist and explore some robots and a cube.
That's how a little moon.
You have pieces of a world we have to build the rest still.
Yeah, that's the social aspect.
Social space.
That's the social aspect.
You want to do this whole thing about conversations.
Yeah, conversations which is frustration, not suicide.
You've got to build the world around that now.
Build the world around the conversation.
Okay?
Because you don't know that.
You want your world.
So you want your world to be communal and open.
So open, yeah.
You have to explain why.
Okay.
You can't just have a date.
I know like this.
Could you come up with a list of questions about the world?
Well, that's what we're going to do tomorrow.
We're going to do it on the day.
Yeah.
So I would take a minute to get what I need you to build us.
There's just a rough outline of like general behavior.
Okay.
Behavior and then that'll behave your sociology.
More sociology.
And more culture and more, you know, anthropological.
We don't need to know what the world looks like.
What we really need to know is what the world is.
Well, the world, what it looks like is a part too.
Because it's a vertical structure.
Remember, these are...
You know, I mean...
I think you're getting caught up in it too much again.
I mean, like...
Okay.
We need to know...
The overall feeling, not the...
I know, just...
I need to know what it looks like.
Just that.
I don't need a bunch of stuff.
I just need to know what it looks like.
Okay.
So, like...
Because...
Is it arid?
Is there a fence?
Because people that grow up around the fence,
someone pathetic, the nurse,
gonna go up in the mountains,
and the mountains,
they tend to be harsher,
more independent types.
Because...
It's a harsher,
living in a satellite,
though the communities are smaller and closer to it.
But,
planes community,
typically tend to be bigger and more social,
because they have more supplies.
They're not struggling as much,
because there's more,
but in game,
it's not the only solution.
Um, step up and I will do the exact same thing.
So, definitely,
I need to find this more tomorrow.
I'm sure.
It is a post-scarcity society,
it's a society where there is...
No, no.
No, no, no, it's scarcity.
See, you're mistreating it again.
It's about like...
There's no plant life.
Yeah, there's lots of plant.
It's a solar conquery,
that's it's green,
it's lush,
it's gorgeous,
but it's also...
See, they changes...
This is the fact that those plants change them.
People that are around plants tend to have a different outlook
than those that grow up in more cityscape.
It's more comfortable.
It's more natural as it's more.
It's not even that.
It's just more warm.
It's cozy.
It's...
Imagine the warmth of campfire and...
See, you're getting...
You're getting too precise again.
Okay.
You have to be very abstract
because you want to avoid locking yourself down
because campfire was locked you down to outside.
When we're talking about more like,
if those plants, it means some more like
there would be a pathetic video in the mountains.
Okay, that makes sense.
You're finding more care for traits and their actual thing.
Yeah, because right now we've got to figure out what the world is.
Because you know what it is, but now we've got to figure out
how to convey it to the rest.
Right.
Right now.
Yeah, we're going to have to...
We've got three hours.
We're going to do the storyboard just before we even do the story.
We've got to figure out what are the parameters.
What's...
Set the boundaries, set the stage.
Yeah, that's what I was trying to use that as an example before.
Because you have all the detail inside of it,
but nothing leaves it.
So, before we even get it going,
we need to figure out what it looks like.
That's why we need paper so we can do the rough sketching of
just that specific video.
Because we don't want to build the whole world yet.
Because you want to let your cultivars do that.
All we're doing is trying to figure out the social aspect of it.
And then we have...
When we had that defined, we can better treat the characters in the world.
Because right now, we just kind of want to get a loose...
We're not trying to build a support as much as we're trying to.
It is to build something in the whole world right now.
Because we don't have everything together.
You want to let them...
They're going to be the detail.
We're just building the spine.
Oh, that's where I'm putting it.
We're literally just giving them the structure to build off of it.
We don't want to limit them to a sort of aspect.
We don't want to make the show...


# REC004.txt
So imagine multi-color plants.
Red and orange and green.
You're going back and you're getting wake up.
Okay, well, try to imagine...
Well, vibrant social space.
It's actually a space where there's color in it.
It's not dark and you talk in a dystopic light.
If you see a modern section, use in that.
Then I'll just say it's a solar pump world.
That's it.
You don't want to destroy the world.
That's a sunny point though.
It's a utopian non-combat game.
What do you want to do?
I don't want utopia.
It's a kind of a mixed meaning.
It's kind of a problem.
I don't mind it.
It would be a better way.
Utopia has got cold implications attached to it.
Because when you tell people you talk to them,
they just kind of shut off on you.
Why?
Why, why, why, why, why, why do you want to shut it here?
I'm going to start with that.
Let's start with that one.
I was going to describe it.
That's when you're up.
I guess.
Just let me know.
It hasn't taken you out for this.
It's about seven minutes.
That's it.
That's not a bad idea, actually.
I don't know why.
I'm probably going to be a little bit lower because
we're going to be bouncing around.
So I'm going to play Lovecraft in the background.
Not just, not for like an example,
but just so you can get a feel of what we're trying to do.
Okay.


# REC005.txt
more than a surprise for you.
It wasn't that it was more terrifying out of here.
So we weren't supposed to understand what these things were.
We were supposed to exist in a plane that we detect,
go for a hint of them.
Because literally, when your story is the only one that can actually
simply look like what I'm saying to you.
What do you guys know?
They seem so cosmic.
The older they know, the better it was.
Nice, really cool storyline.
Back in that.
I don't know your depth of discord at all.
It goes well with Jack, but I'm probably going to stay for
an half hour or so.
Okay, yeah, discord works.
And then I'm going to pass out a broken place too.
It works.
Yeah.
Yeah.

Hey, what do you call this? Um, world building? No, it would be how would you describe
You're setting a scene setting
But you have the character interactions in the world building and I want to do both, right?
You have the, uh, you're setting a scene, scene setting and you have world building, you have both
And story building
Story building
Story building
Story building
So I have this thing called NDD, especially a narrative design document
That's, I got to separate things out because you're right, it's, it's, it's, it's too dense
If I, storyboarding
A narrative design document
A narrative direction document, I can say
Story building
Story building
Okay, should I cut like the, uh, creative direction document
Do you think I could do both these world building and story building one document?
Yeah
You think they were sparse?
Don't you, right? I think that we will need, uh, a good amount of room to work with
The pieces, what do you mean?
Okay, so overall
So that's like the overall story, that's the character story, but, um, I think games have an interesting opportunity here
We have, we can have sub stories and we can have overall stories
Oh, the six main characters, the six, all right
I think you
Yeah, I think you're in the redirection there, I think you're, you're accurately, or you're, you've got your description of what we need to do there
It doesn't make sense
Uh, there's a way to, on Google Drive at this, there's a way to, or I could do a Dropbox actually, I like it better
We could have sections, sampled out in a form, private form
Like you have, it's always mechanically laid out in, but you have them done in order, like a PDF, not to the PDF for the team, they covers everything, like an actual game design document
Okay, so I'm thinking here, look my screen real quick, I'll show you what I'm doing
Oops
Oops, uh, the screen share, okay
So I had information here, right, and I have, I've just a little bit, that I worked out, that I kind of finalized, but then over here
On this side, this is the actual game design document, or a part of that anyway, this is a gutted version, because I want to keep the formatting
I need to, this is my focus, right, and I want to keep, provide the categories that work to explain it better
So let's see, um, one for characters, one for behaviors, one for like that kind of thing, and I, um, character behaviors
For example, how do you, what might, what might be a good way to, uh, flare or take you late one, I give you a character, any character
Let's see
So I fully convey some aspect of, that, with that character, so let's say, um, with their character
So I, I think that works
So I've been thinking about the characters for a while
Um, that was last year, there's still nothing, then, and, let's see
Okay, well this is more, imagine, because of scope, and because of how difficult it is to create new languages
English persists, because there's like a hundred people who are so that, that call us the area and then it
Not really
Okay, all three things on, I've got to think about some more, um, what time are you going to be up tomorrow?
Okay, yeah, just to be up and ready, I'm gonna stay up, I'm gonna kind of create a template for this, uh, process, like, um, ask me some questions about the world and kind of fill that, that knowledge
Um, that time works
Okay, let's wake up whenever I'm not, I'm not gonna rush you if I'm gonna be up for a good long while

else had ever dared to see.
Remote in the desert of Aradilai, the nameless city, crumbling and inarticulate.
Its low walls nearly hidden by the sands of uncounted ages.
It must have been thus before the first stones of Memphis were laid, and while the bricks
of Babylon were yet undate, there is no legend so old as to give it a name, or to recall
that it was ever alive.
But it is told of in whispers around campfires, and muttered about by grandams, the
intense of shakes, they think its folklore, for the rest of the world, the people in this
desert knows real, but everyone else can make the desert folklore, like the digit or something.
Damn.
Who's people want to go to the city, because anyone in the desert of the city either dies
or comes back and say, they want to stay away from the city.
Tribe shunned without only knowing why.
It was of this place that Abdul Al-Hazret, the mad poet, dreamed on the night before
he sang his unexplainable couplets.
That is not dead, which can't eternal lie, and with strange eons even death may die.
So that is Azathaf, Azathaf, the Qatulah.
The number Azathaf I told you is the dead dumb dream that will exist in his dream.
Qatulah is the embodiment of his power within that dream, so as calm on the reports he
was Azathaf's son, Qatulah is the gatekeeper and the gate, he is the lock and the key.
So in H.P. Lovecraft universe, the gods know they're going to win, look great war against.
Those are God known as Yagsaath.
He is the one that knows of the gate, so it's what they came to last time, and they know
where it is they know how to open it, the promise is they need humans to open it.
But because they were fighting to do it, they were the group on all side, and as aware of
it, this is that it's fighting the Sparrow to keep humanity going, they know eventually
they were going to lose or just trying to fight time.
That's the whole theme of Lovecraft, as we know we're losing the war, we're just literally
buying time as much as we can to see we can figure out a way to kill them, because the creatures
that killed them died in the process, so we only have wreckages of what they used to
kill them in pieces, we can't fully stop them, we can just impede their progress.
And so this whole group's purpose is they know that they've already lost, that they're
just buying an extra day every once in a while.
That's like climate change, they realize they've lost, and they realize they're just
band-aiding it as much as they can.
And the doctor explains that he's like, no, we don't want to, so they win, so the creatures
know they win.
So because of it, they're not going to hold you to win, so they're just fucking of humanity.
That's like the yellow king I told you about, his sign, if you really wanted to, all you
had to do is put it in a cloud, and you could kill a whole continent, but he doesn't, he
hides it, he has this quote, and he convinced them that it's religious, and all of it shows
it can see it.
That's how they call it.
So the ritual is how you get shown it, and eventually it drives you fucking batshit.
One guy described it as static, but each time he slept, the static got clearer and clearer,
and finally it turned to voices, it was whispers.
And then the whisper slowly got louder and louder, and then I still feel like, you're forming
a consciousness here.
So you're grazing him in his sleep, and then it slowly turned to hands.
And this was his dreams, he was envisioning this, and the only way he fixed it was he
poured gas in on himself, and let himself look out.
Oh, go back to the grandfather and the grandson, did you explain the situation again?
The, um, explain the whole route from the grandfather taking control, the grandfather
assuming a consciousness was in the mind of this grandson, yeah, taking control of his
was always there.
What happens is he made a deal with a worshiper of the old ones a long, long time ago, and
they promised, cause so here on the site of the grandson's house, there was a house, there
was a swamp, and a path that goes through it, and at the end of this path is a broken
towel.
Oh my God.
When a grandson inherited it, he was told, do you not touch the swamps, the towel, touch
nothing.
The house exactly as it is.
Okay, so, oh Leo, can I, can I go back to that?
Yeah.
Alright, so I'm thinking, this story in mind, this analogy, you just come up with a general
map of the area, if this is the hub, and this is the area you explore, imagine this
area being a little larger, but it's like this, and you explore more regions, or it can
get larger as we produce more content.
So, the reason why they used the swamp is, because this towel was hidden, not everyone
knew about it, so the interesting thing about the towel is it was made out of a gray stone
and not from the area, and there was a symbol buried on it.
It was a broken pill with a torch inside, but you can envision that, a torch inside?
Yeah, a broken pill capsule with a torch inside of it, almost like a streak of lightning.


# REC008.txt
order ones. So when the order ones got here, there was oil and rice here. They were a pre-candle
and super advanced life forms that looked at these giant stone cities. Like how you're
talking about, that's mountain madness.
all right.
all right over there.
Uh...
Brisbane?


# REC009.txt
So at the base, there was a stone of this sign on it.
Kradansen was told to remove it in a dream, and that's how it started.
He started chipping away at this thing.
And then he realized, wait, what am I doing?
So he went back to the house, and then he started having these vivid dreams of going
back into the swamp at night.
So the thing about the gods is animals can perceive them.
The frogs, especially.
They also can appear as many forms.
So the god Hisees, when you see it from far away, looks like light, balls of light coming
from the sky almost like an aurora boy Alice.
Okay, tangent here, real quick, hold this up.
So imagine there are no stars in the night when you look into the sky in this world.
That's not old, I just have to look outside right now.
But even with minimal light pollution, if you look on the regions that are not affected
by the light, which is that there are a lot, you go into tundra and you look into space.
There is no star beyond the sky, except a one that lights the blades.
Oh, so you were having to be the only star?
The only star is the earth.
It's our from our home that we've allowed to persist as is, and then the world beyond
it has been encapsulated in these dyson swarms.
Okay, so we left one star.
We left the one star, humanity left one star, but every each of these stars, every
star in the galaxy has been allowed the optimal light for the bodies that exist.
So imagine like the dyson swarm yet, but then there's holes, little bits, little lights
that point toward the relevant bodies in the solar system.
So you look into the sky and you see that the center of the Milky Way is cleared, the
center of the Milky is visible, and there is a black hole, whether it's a massive black
hole, they were right and we were correct.
But at the center of that cloud, that dust, or that debris that's preventing full vision,
there is the super mega black hole, that's around the Dodec, the Dodec around the Milky
Way center, right, and hypothetically, you could extend it onto the galaxy if my half
is.
So it's ready to go all the way to the bathroom in the toilet.


# REC010.txt
the perfect track there. So we're going to get the tape so we can take some of this up.
Idea in my head, so I don't forget it. So what we're doing here.
This is right here.
So what wish we should do?
We should gradually expose the center.
You can't see the stars, but people don't believe the people know the stars are there.
Because they can see infrared.
They're not superstitious. They understand that these are...
No, I'm not saying they understand these are just worms.
They think of the tower.
They don't give...
They do aspire to similar star meaning and they know it's Earth.
Oh, so they see the light and they know it's Earth.
They think that Earth is in spirit because humanity drives there.
And they've been there because they drive there.
But why do we have Dyson's form? Why do...
The Earth has Dyson's form and I first...
Doesn't have Dyson's form and this one does have a Dyson's form.
So what is the difference?
Well, we've aspired...
They don't know that we've aspired to hold it.
They think that...
Because humanity drives there, because you're mentioning well that they've been allowed to...
He wants to keep the star of a lit.
It's what they believe.
Because they're...
So is that still a whole thing?
That light they see, that also not.
It is Earth.
The light is Earth, but then...
So...
He's thinking that the actual action...
We shouldn't reveal the door again.
No, I don't want to reveal the door again.
I'm talking about it.
You said that most of the stars are in the Dyson's form, correct?
Yeah.
You said that those are single bright winded by stars.
This was all when...
The figure of the tower, we said that they draw strength in the tower, at least emotionally.
Is there anything that they've applied to that store, it being the only wet store?
Did they give it a meaning, like how we give our son, meaning our son is just a store?
But...
Think of it, there were sun coats.
There were the tarot coat that was built around quenching the thirst of this god,
not because it told them to.
Because we looked at it, and we figured that there was something to it.
What could they aspire to, if it wasn't superstitious?
That wasn't immediately...
Of course, of course.
Or imagine they...
They wanted to make themselves better for the youngness.
Or they believed the youngness race?
Or they...
Oh yeah, exactly the thing.
They could view it like the torch and the darkness.
You know what that means?
Torch and darkness.
Go for it.
So, the four of you would give it a fire.
Humanity was a core dumb species.
This is a Greek man talking about, of course, they give it a fire for medias.
Before humanity was given fire, the guards would watch us suffer in the cold and the dark beast
would attack us at night because they were not afraid.
The darkness would hide them.
Humanity was doing awful crimes each other because no one could see.
We had these dark spots.
And in these dark spots, they weren't these people evil,
but the darkness in those swords amplifies.
There was nothing there to guide them, so they would lash out.
Imagine in this event, I'm going to go back to the end again,
and thinking to this idea, this...
No, you're good.
That's pretty everywhere.
That's actually kind of pretty cool.
What's one of them?
That's one.
That?
That was the room trip.
That was the one?
The room trip.
That's why the journal was still fucked up.
Where is the office?
It's right there.
No, the pages, that was where the pages were.
The city?
Or the...
There was more information in there.
The fire?
Right here.
It's in your center.
It's only looking for...
There's more papers.
There's two papers in the end that was working on.
So those...
I don't know what I'm doing.
Oh, and in the back of that there was...
Yeah, now that's the swamp that we built.
This is a swamp for...
Oh, it's...
It's got some swamp that's the city.
It's an epic city.
No.
This is the swamp from...
That, both from...
We used to love Greg's story.
I know.
But this is the...
This is the...
Yeah.
The visual of that swamp.
Yeah.
But it's done for...
I think we can use this as a game design.
I mean, so this is...
You can tell it straight again.
Hypothetically, with the tropes, with the flow of that narrative.
Yeah.
Do this.
Imagine, like, you're at partial consciousness here.
Okay.
You're a doughnut, right?
You're not fully aware.
Yeah, you can see yourself in here.
Some of you...
It expands, moves on.
You get more and more aware of yourself until you're...
Here.
And you have the full body.
You have it.
So, like, the narrative...
It starts off...
And the whole...
You get the body, like, right here, really?
Right?
But then...
Right here?
So, you get into caught up in the details again.
That's...
So, not...
And those are probably creative.
But you get caught on time and fix.
I know.
This freaking place one doesn't need for a new size.
Okay.
You're not.
But it doesn't need...
It doesn't need for size for a new grip or something.
Well, it doesn't even need that.
Because this is...
This is your city.
This is a city from...
The back was admitted.
This is...
This is...
This is...
This is...
This is...
This is...
This is an abstract storytelling method.
So, imagine there's not being a swamp.
Imagine this being a vast city.
You have these...
I mean, you're trying to move duality.
You're trying to move it out of space.
And I'm doing that.
I'm trying to...
We have a little hero here.
But that's not even small.
This is...
This is one of these.
Imagine this being a center ofних.
It's easily a sheathe on the other side of the street, though.
It's somewhere in that city.
Imagine this being a center of Dash.
There's this easily a sheathe in the other side of the city.
There's this easily a sheathe in the other side of the city.
Imagine this being a center of爸爸.
It's easily a sheathe in the other Communist building.
It's easily a sheathe in the other side of the city.
It seems almost like a town with the influence of theCity.
Imagine this being the center of sherry.
I guess...
It seems almost like a city...
Imagine this being a center of всего sherry.
It seems almost like a city...
Imagine this being a center of sherry.
It seems almost like a city.
Imagine this being a center of scherry.
Let's
So okay, so you get a little bit caught up again on the 1080 toes
No, so he wants to just grab a new sheet
But it makes sense though, right? And it's just it's not cohesive it's not cohesive enough your son
No, so what's happening is you're drawing something over the drone
So it's no one to see what we need because there's only stuff on there
Okay, that's the point
Okay, so know that this was started because...
Well, hang on, I'm ahead and I'm okay
So keep getting fixated on this
This is not your wall, that is a different spot
We need to remember you'll build in the spaces
Try to scratch
We're not so done for scratch, we're so done


# REC011.txt
had good reason for shunning the nameless city.
The city told of in strange tales, but seen by no living man, yet I defied them and went
into the untrodden waste with my camel.
I alone have seen it, and that is why no other face bears such hideous lines of fear as
mine.
Why no other man shivers so horribly when the night wind rattles the windows.
When I came upon it in the ghastly stillness of unending sleep, it looked at me, chilly
from the rays of a cold moon amidst the desert's heat, and as I returned its look I forgot
my triumph at finding it, and stopped still with my camel to wait for the dawn.
For hours I waited till the east grew gray and the stars fitted, and the gray turned
rosy light edged with gold.
I heard a moaning and saw a storm of sand stirring among the antique stones, though the sky
was clear and the vast reaches of the desert still.
Then suddenly above the desert's far rim came the blazing edge of the sun, seen through
the tiny sandstorm which was passing away.
And in my fevered state I fancied that from some remote depth there came a crash of musical
metal to hail the fiery disc as Memnon hails it from the banks of the Nile.
My ears rang and my imagination seeth, as I led my camel slowly across the sand to that
unvocal stone place, that place too old for Egypt and Merua to remember, that place which
I alone of living men had seen.
In and out amongst the shapeless foundations of houses and palaces I wandered, finding never
a carving or inscription to tell of those men, if men they were, who built the city and
dwelt there in so long ago.
The antiquity of the spot was unwholesome, and I longed when a counter-somer sign would
device to prove that the city was a deep patch on the by-man kind.
There was a second provocation.
I think you catch what he said, do you agree with it?
When he started off the city he was like, he said he couldn't find anything that showed
the men that had built the city and the men had built it.
So that with low cap, he doesn't really start off with its monsters.
He always has an out for the character to explain the phenomena.
Like the character is in, he goes in, see something in all sense, oh it's a demon, it's, well
I thought I heard music.
So like with this one, this guy as he slowly explodes, it's not what he sees, it's what
he knows isn't there, it starts hitting him off, it's something's off about the city.
I had proportions and dimensions in the ruins which I did not like.
I had with me many tools and dug much within the walls of the obliterated edifices, the
progress was slow, and nothing significant was revealed.
When night and the moon returned, I felt a chill wind which brought new fear so that
I did not dare to remain, and as I went outside the antique walls to sleep, a small sighing
and the storm gathered behind me, blowing over the grey stone, the storm was bright, and
most of the city coming off.
Yeah, that's just the, imagine I awake, just it dawned, and I'm agitated with horrible dreams.
I don't know why I was expecting this for so many times, no, no, this is important.
I saw the sun, so this is here, the last gusts of a little sandstorm that hovered over
the continuous city down the slumark, and I know quite often that the two poor kids just
talk about what we have right now.
I don't want you to rush it, don't rush it, I don't want you to rush it, don't rush
it.
Okay.
Okay.
So here's a reference I want you to look at, because I think it's relevant to what
you're doing.
Remember what I sent you yesterday in this corner?
The inside of those, that tarot David, let's see if we can find it in there.
So see how they torn these slices into actual spaces, are you sending it to the concept
otis?
Yeah.
It's referring to reference I suppose?
Yeah.
So you see how this is rounded?
Look at what they did here, they torn the each slice into its own little section of life
pretty much.
So imagine the space between this, imagine the space is in between this, in large, that
where there's enough sunlight coming in, that's what this is for, right?
You also got to remember that this is the opposite of what you're trying to convey, the
bidding on a convex, you're bidding on a concave, right?
Okay.
So imagine, I'm not even worried about the shape.
What I'm talking about is exclusively the people, because see how they use all this space
they didn't waste anything.
Yeah.
It's efficient with space, but it's also comfy enough.
So what is the edging, or are you still establishing what they explain?
They imagine this is the same space, they can't expand it, hypothetically, but they need
to have stronger structures.
So they're out of the limitation of expansion right now, you see?
Yeah.
These are little clones, this is how far they can build.
So then we want to convey that, and the narrative, you want to write that down in the
document, that they're still building on the city.
Okay.
Let me just write that down.
Well, because we have it here.
Oh, shit.
Meo.
Okay.
Let's go.
Well, because that's going to change the narrative, because if they realize that the city's under
construction, the city is going to have a way to make the growth on the other side of
the city.
We're growing.
It's.
Ben.
So for example, don't have the careful walk by and say, oh, we want a construction, have
a walk by, but maybe nod to it, shucks, yeah, or the construction workers of robots, and
then the machine, the player doesn't know that yet.
I mean, there's typical machines, there's no small robots, not just social, I don't know,
there's dodax.
Oh, there's no, there's human machines, but they're still going to be human oversight.
They're, they're autonomous.
They're what?
They're still being so annoying to be there.
They're autonomous to the best degree we can, we can make them.
I'm not talking about what they're doing, I'm not talking about that, it's all the thing
we trust.
What do you mean?
I trust the machines?
No, not even that.
I don't know if you would have a person there just to kind of keep the way that people
from fucking with the robots.
You don't, not necessarily, it's trusting, people know that these robots help, and they're
cute, but they're so annoying.
They're like, they're going too crazy, sir.
You need to slow your own.
No, people aren't as cruel as you, Mike.
No, I'm not even saying, so you keep saying that, I'm saying that.
I'm not saying anything cruel.
I'm not saying anything cruel.
No, not cruel, not cruelty.
I'm asking you.
I think you have some reason.
I miss, I misspoke, I misspoke.
So literally all I said was I was so in at the site.
Okay.
That's all I've conveyed.
I haven't put in a motion on it.
I didn't mean that.
It's all I've said was I was so in at the site.
But the human would be though trying to figure out the level of progress.
There's someone working on request, someone designing machines, maybe someone to ink
with them.
Okay, but who's the thing?
There could be a local mechanic or whatever, but you need to get the code to send
an interactive.
Because if you don't want to say there's a construction site, how are you going to have
them interact with the construction?
What if that's the one thing the society likes?
What if what if construction is the one thing that they know they need?
But no one is, there's not enough people going to do it.
Well, it's not about the, there's a little bit, a little bit of, you can't cut it up
again.
I'm not saying he's building on it.
I'm just saying he's there at the location for the code to interact with.
Because he can't have a colonization for a robot, he said the basic robots.
So it doesn't have to be so in attached to the construction.
I'm just saying those so-and-for-them interact with, it brings the construction view into
topic.
Okay, yeah, yeah, it works.
So imagine, okay.
See, I'm not trying to say there's an overload or a watchman, I'm just trying to say those
so-and-so.
Because we have to talk about the construction, so we don't want to say he's building where
he's watching.
Okay, so imagine this thing.
Sorry, scratch.
Oh no.
I'm starting scratch.
Turn on suction scratch.
I'm building off this.
I'm trying to use your idea to read better, better convey this idea.
Okay, so imagine you are the AEI, you're on the space.
There is a lack of maintenance, there's enough maintenance, it's well-camped.
But there needs to be more maintenance there is, and no one in this local space is willing
to step up to do it.
It's a community effort.
You've got to have mechanical skill, you've got to have mechanical knowledge, like a social
cultural thing.
No one's going to do it.
But no one has enough, these things are small, they're non-concentral, people don't do
it.
There are small fixes on small stuff too, whatever, but I mean it's not going to process
some maintenance.
I would illustrate that, not that it's being left behind, but it's being given a smaller
priority.
Yeah.
You're right, they're building outwards, that's why the most of the construction focuses
on that.
Oh my god, Leo.
Okay.
That's perfect.
You have to have the empathetic, so they're not just going to be like, oh, that's your
guy, that's probably him.
No, it's like, okay, they're not on.
People that could be doing this, they're instead they're out there and they're building
towards Utopia, they're building out the city, they're just going to be like, well, I'm not
doing that.
You need to explain why it's not being addressed, because you said they were empathetic,
they're Utopia, no more, so they have enough resources.
So for us, we would say, well, that's a little priority, but for them, we would have to
figure out why is a little priority for them, so we could use the construction outwards.
So we need to then figure out a way to bring in the AI into that process.
Maybe have the Portuguese meeting?
Okay.
Imagine that guy being a local engineer.
Imagine that guy going to be walking on this, or as he just passing by, that's something
we need to consider before he takes the wrong steps into the narrative.
Let's say he's trying to find a location, maybe they know that the dodex can be conscious
and he's trying to learn how to make it conscious, he's trying to learn how to make it, I know
they're trying to do this.
He knows how to make them analyst, he knows how to make them, you know, get them on the
feet, so to speak, put them in that moving form.
And this AI doesn't get, doesn't get, go out to the get to the place.
This is, okay, this is the player, but they can't get an analyst to form, they're not
developed enough, they can't actually jump to an analyst to form that way.
So instead, they have to be tied to a body.
They're given a mechanical form, they're given a normal human machine form to latch onto
the nervous system.
We have to have a way to have the player talk to people.
Right, and that's the beeping, that's the, so they, they get the,
they're not talking, I mean, we need to wait for force conversation.
So hang on, coming back to it, stepping back again, hang on.


# REC012.txt
So I imagine the player starting off as a camera as we discussed, and it can appear in different areas of the room.
Okay.
Yes, it can appear in different areas.
Or maybe it's sprouts in the point.
It cannot weave to the room.
Like a lot on details could go on.
Anyway, so it starts in the point.
And how does it interact with?
Because people recognize it as a thing that's going to happen.
They see it's going to sprout soon.
So it's hanging in there, ready to wake up, and they're ready forward to...
It brings blanks to life.
Oh, hey, it's a wake.
Okay, so they're awake.
Oh, hey, they're awake.
They recognize it as something that's a potential being.
And then the player gets his first place eventually.
They find a mirror in the mirror in the bathroom.
Because that's a weird spot.
But that's when it's open when the one's there.
They wander in a mirror.
Whoa.
I think it's in my hands.
But it's more of a...
How would it force conversation?
Not how he talks, but how are we going to get him talking?
Like, what is the trigger for why he's at this construction site talking to this person?
Because it's around in passing.
Let's say it's a little bit further on the story.
So pausing on the intro.


# REC013.txt
And then we're talking to the guy that the sixth person that isn't in the room, he's talking to you.
Huh?
So, you don't have to, this is why.
So imagine this construction, this engineer, this whole engineer.
He is, he's the maintenance guy.
He built this body for the, for the, for the dodaq.
He recognizes that it needs a form and it can't form into a,
anything more complex because they communicated this.
They found out it's like, you know, maybe, maybe, hey, if you want to join us some time,
but it's rooted, it can't move, so we give it a new root.
And the root is the body that they can move around in.
Why are they talking?
They're talking because they're trying to make sure it can move.
Make sure he's inside of the construction.
He's not assigned, he's, he's, it's all following his work.
No, I mean, is he going to work on it?
He wants to work on it, he's curious.
He's interested in helping this machine,
forming to a time.
If they want to, it's more of a curiosity thing in humanity.
I mean, it's, it's like voluntary like the rest of the community.
You can go around fixing stuff you want to.
And you can't stay with us against that, actually.
No, it is.
In this society, in this, in this society, fixing things is encouraged.
It's like, you, people are constantly, people can learn, people can learn.
Let me get this kind of really quick.
So what I'm trying to figure out is, you want this AI to construction site.
So we need to figure out why is it at the construction site.
Well, let's say it's pushing towards the construction site.
Let's say it's not.
We've already said he's there because you're really shocked.
I don't know.
No, no, this person isn't necessarily tied to the construction.
He knows the instructions, talk to the constructions,
he can inform players about the construction.
But he's interested in the social maintenance.
He's not interested in the construction maintenance.
It's respected.
You're getting stuck again.
You're getting stuck on our ward and not on trying to get away.
OK.
Why is he talking to this guy?
Is he talking to the guy?
Because he wants to spot on the construction.
Or is this a passing conversation?
He's, he's, the character, the player, the player talking to the guy, right?
Yeah, but you need to figure out what is the intent of the conversation.
OK, the intent of the conversation.
Let's, let's, so the two bodies, the two bodies, intent wise.
OK, so imagine.
But no, this is what you want to ask, right?
No, so, what I'm, I'm trying to get you to focus on these two people.
I need you to figure out why they're having the conversation.
What is the purpose of the conversation?
I'm trying to explain that.
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't.
Why they get there?
OK, and how, so what they're, what they're about.
What they're, what they're about.
We're worried about the point of the conversation.
Intent, right?
Intense, what you want to know, isn't it?
Yes or no?
So I want to know what the AI wants out of this conversation.
conversation. The AI is the player. The player wants to have freedom. The player wants to have body.
But the player wants to have a goal for the conversation right now. We're talking about the conversation.
Okay, they're talking to someone. Okay. Oh, we haven't established foundation yet. We can't build that yet.
Yeah, we don't know what the fuck they're talking about. They're trying to figure out.
Well, we're going to go back to the foundation then. Alright.


# REC014.txt
Okay, let's say we got established characters. Where's the seniors over there?
Well, that's not the CD, but let's just a other side. It's not all right. Where's it at?
Also, we'll back the office. Yeah, I'm like that
This paper, okay
Okay, so you need to figure out what is the trivial conversation between the AEI and the engineer whoever it is
So I think we need to establish we need to establish characters first before we can actually establish the way they interact with each other
Remember these two are close
Well, but okay, so yeah, we have to we have to we have to we have to explain the social context, right?
We need this this this player knows this player that we can we can add details like this relationship to close our relationship to co-work card and relationship to
Well, so does this engineer?
This engineer knows them
By name, but they don't know them personally. He knows them in passing. Yeah, okay, so then we need just the engineer's name
Marry this kind of getting in she is
Marry him
So more it is in the room, so what would happen when she so she just came into the room when she's been in the room for a while
She this is later on she interaction passing. No, I mean Jake. She's coming to give the player
More means to interact
Like joke of the players. Yeah, so
Whole goal isn't to come to talk to the people
Okay, so now we have whole goals the interact with the AEI saw that the city had that she talked to anyone in there and wondered if the sources of its greatness
Myself I pictured all the splendors of an issue to come when she comes in that he talked to anyone
Not a son
Because if she's coming to the door she would automatically see this process
So she greeted them she gets them
She knows
Cardin personally, but she doesn't know Kalesa
Okay, so she was just getting from an informal greeting then
Inform a greeting. Yeah, she's she she
Genose in my name all of my name, but she doesn't she knows some people more than others
But there's still not an extreme connection. You get buried in detail right now. Okay, yeah in personal
Not personally, but not rudely casually. My hands are just more. Hello. Hello. What's up guys?
So she does she talked to anyone else in the room because we got a paint
From what the player is going to see so the player they probably noticed them coming to the room
Let's say cardin Cardin knows her well. So he comes up and he's uh he's
Kind of giving context for conversation
Like what she's doing. She that intro they had to be able to
Establish a foundation of knowledge. So Ryan knows a lot Cardin knows a little. They're both interesting subject
Both talking about the subject of the player
Getting a body, but that's just passing. It's not like
Little bit here in their little information. Not too much
Like that is that is the main conversation. What's up? You're working on this. Oh, that's cool
How would you do how would you write that
What do we? Well, dialogue wise. How would you write the interaction? How would you?
So can the player here?
We'll just describe the scene and then describe the talking the player can't hear
Um
They can hear they can see they can't talk yet. Okay, so what perspective do you want it to be described for?
Uh, you're the player camera. Okay, so then what he would see is he would see the door open
Uh, she would come in
She would give her greeting to the person in the seat because there's no names yet
So he'd see that have a short conversation and then he would come over and approach
She'd probably wave to him just because he said that they were social species
And then he would probably be to hold back and probably to his side
So he wouldn't see the engineer from the front. He would see probably over left shoulder
Coming over whole shoulder. She would probably see
His right arm right shoulder and head
Okay, and then we have to figure out what is the next sequence that she told him to the AI or just she keep talking to Karen
Collison or
Mariam
Oh, I need to write, I need to run this now
So let's say Mariam. Well, don't put it in the scene yet because we'll figure out a little path right now
Well, I'll put it over here. I'm sure it's not the scene yet. This is this is before. This is
So we don't we know she exists. Okay, so we don't need to put it again
So I want to wait till we figure out when she interacts with the player so we know what a place
Because both she's a whole path she takes
After this conversation is going to decide how much of the room the player sees at this side
real
Um
So let's say
Looking
So they they kind of have
Clissa in their far three of you over here
As easy as to a cone
Yeah, I'm trying to do a cone. It's just you got to
Stabbers
So that's a big camera then it's not our traditional Soko camera. It's more of a path Soko
Or should I make it smaller shape? I produced a few of this. So
Most off the field of view is going to decide the shape of the camera. I'm all focused food reviews a smaller camera
Or a smaller lens as I should say a wider view is a wider lens. Let's say you pronounce like this
So it's just like almost like a light bulb then
Yeah
So then you know what you should do then what I would do is if I was you had have it wake up as she comes into the room
And then
Have a focus on home immediately
Have hope have the camera follow the action. Well the camera is the player their full action and so I'm trying to use
Human biology. So the human eye is good at catching movement on the side
Um
On the on the corner of their eye in the far area. So if you have movement over here on the screen
Pleasure like well, what is that? Yeah, but this is this is where we work
No, this is the closer moves
So they look lightweight and then they look over here to see marine come in. No, I know, but I'm not talking about them right now
I'm telling my woman
Women's over there too, but you know what I'm talking about is have her come in
Talk to these two so the player follows it and then when she waves just make the players for you follow that way
It's cool. Okay, imagine this
Imagine they're all reading they don't know when it's gonna wake up. Yeah
So they're all reading throughout the reading they're talking but then
Imagine the player wandering the space and then the first person they talk to
So you guys it's awake and they're awake under the space. Oh, they're just they're just think like a little
A series as seed they're a seed, right? And this is their sparkling
Okay, but if they haven't woken up yet, they can't be exploring the space. No, there are
There this is when they do a wake up and in marine comes a little bit after this
So the player gets to explore first and then marine comes a little little later
This is the first interaction right you have
Whoever's talked to you first they interact they try like they say they say they give a little
Lower context world context the player interact anyway. They want so how can they they can I can I someone says can I pet you and you go like yeah
And then you press yes or no and then they okay, you know
Because they recognize this person as being they recognize this this being as
A person or one
Maybe you would have to figure out that that's a person. No, they they know they know that these things can become conscious
But there's very few of them. No, I'm talking about from the seeds aspect
Just see from the seeds perspective does it realize this is a different organism?
No
I know it
Doesn't have conversation yet. Okay, so you don't you don't have conversation until you
When you get here, but you can you can you can interact a little more in the time of conversation like talk about when it looks at it
Does it realize that this is something different or does it look at it and just see something
Uh, I think you're the you're so these seeds
By themselves apart from the player
Okay, uh as a thing in there's just the rules and you just throw because I'm thinking from the point of the this perspective so
Eight-Eye in themselves
You don't know their intent
Okay, but you don't but they're perspective, right? They
They interact curiously that's all I can do
They can't do anything deal with what I just asked though. I don't even perceive they they is not a thing they know
They is not a thing they they they have
It's just so that they interact curiously
With the right for the player though
For the sake of the player you need to realize that they're going to be forming stuff in their head already
Well, that's what the player is doing automatically. That's okay
But based on how you have that camera is going to affect how that player perceives himself in this world
Because he says you wanted a head height
Yeah, about about player height like by default they're up here. They're they're little
Yeah, they're offset just to be average. So I'm trying to figure out the like the body of it itself
It doesn't have about it yet. It's just okay. So let me try to try it. So how is it up here though?
If it's a small object, how is it going to be a
It's attached to the wall. So imagine it being like head height
Like right here, maybe so it's not it's when you said they're going to be going around the room
Yeah, they like a style you can read that you motion about she getting away the body
But you move in like a character
No, how do you people in so you said he doesn't know he's what he is yet, right?
Left stick. Okay, I'm not asking what I'm saying. Okay, okay, if he's coming out of the wall
It means he has a spot where he's coming out of which means if he comes out for enough and then turns back
You see you see the body you see the body. Yeah, you see what it's connecting to the wall. Yeah, okay
That's a huge point. You have to get the feet per se or a tail or a
I
A string. I don't know. We're just so there's a certain length you get the connection
Okay, so some trying to figure out we've got to figure out it's a great motion for that room because if he can't just have it
Leave the corner and go around the whole room if it's a snake
People are gonna have to walk through what it's going
Well, let's just imagine that they're they're nice about it. They they'll look like oh
You know, we'll see that some trying to figure this because we got to figure out
You're trying to avoid because it's a rigid object
So the problem is I've noticed you're getting hooked on one perspective
You're right and we're trying to fill in at five we have to write percent of the time into it
You're trying to establish information. So I gave you the respect of the player
and the respect of the AI and now we're working the perspective of kalesa marian
rule met
erasai
and sorral
Well, so the other two don't know this is happening yet. So right now we'll only focus on the three in the front
Okay
So the player can wander out one of three directions
Three because because it's a game they can nickname they can have interactions like you can interact with kalesa you interact with cardon
You can touch a moment and
Their interactions with the player differ
Right? Okay, Wilman. Hey, the uh the
It's awake or they're awake or it's awake. It reads it. I don't know if you want to make a little more rude
Uh, it doesn't it be real. It's just it is good. Oh, yeah, you're right. So let's say hey, it's up
Hey guys, it's up and this guy says
uh
Oh, hey, hey, you're up, buddy. Hi
Um, this will maybe he's like uh
Places like hey, they're up
You know or you can have uh
Uh, I don't really have you have different expressions of the dialogue
different expressions of the character in that short little beat of info beat of information
How long is this scene supposed to last?
Uh, that's the first interaction you have and then there's a
smaller interaction throughout that so
Now if you interact with kalesa cardon will come and they'll interact together will map work on that comment
He'll wander in
You know he'll come in this space you you have a little time to speak with these guys
And then will not come in or you can speak the moment for a long time
Good chunk of time before these two guys
So how would they notice if you next to them you wake up
Like how wouldn't they notice?
Well, they're talking to each other. They don't remember they don't they don't and they know it's gonna wake up, but they're not
Just said those emotion. Yeah, they have a tail and you gotta go across the room. We're gonna see
Well, it's okay. Let's set an obstruction. That's like six feet long going across. Let's say they notice like right over here
Like well, hey, it's up, you know
Um to this point will be a little
interaction point
At a turning point in the air
So and then a wake on a wake
TP for turning point
Um
I
Um
And then really comes in that this is TP one trigger one if you if you study with that direction
This is TP two
Let's see you see how you callissa
So while I'm talking is I'm forced to the conversation length that you would have for the guy in the back
Hmm
You said if you talked about that force you'd have a normal conversation. Why would it be different than if you talked to the other's force?
He's not as
curious
But he's not as
Intensive curious as they are. He's he's more interested. But why would it be him? You talking to them force the fact that the conversation if I'm letting
I'm waiting. I don't know. I'm an idiot. Um
These guys
They interact quickly and move the dialogue quickly this guy if you the players more curious the longer
You know, they'll explore the room and then
You're after you talk to these guys
You can explore this but they they they can explore this place further and then talk to him
Okay, but when you force describe that you said if they go to room and force they get a little conversation please out of them
Imagine if we have to have time we have an interval here because this is getting confusing because I think that
I don't know maybe it's we have to write a time on actual time on events
Of main events also trying to figure out the timeline soon
Well, I think I can try better for have like uh
This event this this these two branching events. We don't need to write it all down yet, but we don't even have a fluid one for me now
Well, you want the main events that for so long time to figure out is just come out of the wall
What what I said has nothing to do with any of this what I'm asking is you told me on the force run through this
And when he gets here you would have a longer conversation than if he went here for us
why
Conversation and I think that was
Miss bookend because you can't have conversation. No, I mean, but why would your interaction be longer down here than if you've done them
What does he talk about philosophy and art?
He's guys talk about science. Why would his he talked less if you went to that post
He's not as socially inclined
He's not as intensely curious if these guys are easy. Okay, so let me try to explain this very quick
So you said if he cuts to him post you get a longer interaction than if you want to and then to him
So what is that difference
Why does going to them when you go to hand cut his interaction down
What if you just made them same length interaction just uh because if this is if this is too
Out there then no
I have to figure out
So I'm just trying to figure out the chain of events because if we have him waking up we have the engineer coming eventually
We need to describe why
If so what you were saying were always if you talk to them it would show the interaction of them is because the engineer is coming in I think we need to establish more characters
I think we're focusing too far we're going too far in the story and because we don't we don't know them yet
We don't know their interactions. You don't know how they interact. Well, this is how we do so we need to build the interaction post
Before we put what they're interacting with we need to build that interaction so we know what it looks like. Okay. Okay
Well you just track it. I can you up to this point. Can you better? Can you better articulate the idea?
I know the objective is you haven't told me what it is. It will be objective. They're curious and they'll interact in different way
Imagine a symbol of curiosity about to go overhead. Okay, so
I'm trying to figure out when the engineer comes in
When the engineer comes in
Okay, so that's okay. So first
And then they have curiosity that these two of curiosity is not interested
So what I'm trying to get is you can use the engineer as a break in the interaction you can use the engineer
To make the player interactive whichever one he did in the first time
Oh, I see it. Okay, hang on
Because he's not an inactive everyone at once. He's gonna have to pick one of the other first
Well, I mean, it's more of a
You watch the character interact interact with each other, but he can't actually interact
He can't interact with them, but only when he's in the space with them
I know but he's gonna have to eventually pick one to store with he can't interact with both at the same time
Well, as it works out is you interact with Galisa, right?
And then
Cardin comes in he talks automatically
You talk to Cardin then Galisa comes in and she talks automatically. It's more of a
introductory and then
someone comes in and then cardin leads the conversation and then you interact with Galisa
Galisa leaves the conversation and then cardin jumps in and then he's going to sort of if you go to world moment
When it talks to you
talks philosophy a little bit talks hard or maybe you just says something interesting like
I don't know if you want me to get into it
No, you're awake
I don't know the characters
So here's what I'm trying to figure out is you gotta
So when you're the player you have to convey a path because no matter what there's only a limited amount of paths they can take
It's like you said they can either go
Here or they can go to here
So we need to establish is
If he takes one how do we incentivize on that cure?
Or advice was okay
Well, let's say that so what I was thinking I'm doing is let's say you just want interaction
Oh, okay, the engineer comes in and then they can bounce off so light is actually they can bring people
Uh, interesting to space. So imagine as you start out this room this this entrance right and drive
This entryway
We're just in the building right now
This entryway is is dark
There are two lights here, but they're off right now
So the player interests the space and they they come around they like
They uh look at the window, you know, wow, this is really cool
But uh and then they recognize it as three space
They're come back and they're the bathroom. They see themselves. They go out and then your hands are available
You can like we're going around you can press
R2 and L2 to see your hands only when you go to the bathroom. Yeah, you can see your hands then and then um
Uh
Are you you're suddenly give yourself hands your hands kind of like wow?
You know, uh almost like you don't have to describe shocks me
Okay, anyway um
From there the player comes back out because they've explored the space to explore bathroom
Okay, it's interesting enough to come out and you look in the window you look a lot and they're trying to look in the office
You can't see anything so you kind of move out um and then
Uh
Marianne comes in she steps to the door the lights are on now that we draw the players attention to walls
Maybe the lights are dimmer in the overall room
just to further draw their attention to
So the wall is front and front of them
Marianne comes in clissa and
Uh cardin interact will let stays aside to the far right
He's still reading his book. He's uninterested
Or will then I should say cardin and uh clissa interact and they talked uh marian
So why not just share well met out of it then she's not going to be having an interaction
Hmm
Because you don't want to throw too much at the player at once. No, I do think they should interact with each other
I think that that's why he's he's there. He's a character. You recognize he exists
But he's not interested. This is not throwing too much. This is avoiding throwing too much player
I'm keeping her to the side
But he's still there. He's still waiting for therapy. He's still his relevance
His relevance is he's he's he needs therapeutic help and he's waiting for his his turn in line
Okay, so he doesn't care for so is then he wouldn't necessarily interact with the draw
But he does he recognizes it is social space. He recognizes this thing is there. It's going to uh scrout today or some soon something soon
Um and they come and check out about him and then
Uh
Colisell or cardin to be texted text uh marian like hey, I got your text
So it's up, huh? So they have a way to text each other
They have one interact and I maybe we use AR or I don't know, but there's there's a means that she found
Let's say she does pick her phone and text real quick
Well, or she can text and text and text each other. We don't need to say I know how to say each other
We just need to know that she got a message
See you're getting so full detail
All right, you're right number. We're trying to keep the bare bones right now
So all you need to have is the interaction is they the AI woke up
It's now exploring the room they now notice so now they contact her somehow
So now she's on the way
Now we got to figure out what is a woman doing while they're talking and watching the AI
Is the interacting with the AI or is he ignoring it for the most part
What I'm trying to figure out is does he break off
What he's doing to talk to the AI or do we make the player come to him
Because that's going to shape the narrative because if he has to come in
But that means maybe when Marin comes in he comes into a conversation. They're having
Borses if he had stayed here and then Marin comes in this immediately
We'll let the two's over here. He doesn't actually go come over here. He stays in his little corner
He's sitting in chair reading. No, I'm talking about another branching point for you. Okay another breath. Okay, so
We give the player the choice because he doesn't have to talk to him. Yeah, so let's say the player doesn't and Marin comes through
If
If we have it if he doesn't talk Marin immediately turns to the sprout and addresses it
But maybe if the player has decided to come over here
When he comes up this way
Marin's having a conversation
Oh, I see what you mean. There's okay. So potential. Okay. If you announce will let because you want to have action
Well the player isn't because it's a real world
It's interesting to freeze because he's not there. Yeah, you're right. So that's good
What if the player attracts a moment when it comes to join the group if you interact with well not even room it comes to join the group when the player is interacting
Marin arrives the player gets a chocolate to this area
When the player comes up. It's intentional. Okay, you got to be drawing the intent here is to draw the player
Yeah, well, I'm trying to just give you different ways to run this scene
Because you want to have different branches in the same scene
Let's just say you cross touch to a minute and then you can go from a moment
To here or something you have will make be the trigger
Because the player doesn't have to talk to women to go to the bathroom. No, no, but there's the ones straight across the desk
Yeah, well they can just go like
If they really wanted to
So what I'm saying is if you have them talk to will make reward them with a conversation these
Forces that if you had it will they went to the office and went back to the main conversation. Yeah
Because then once they realize that maybe not on the force playthrough, but on the second if they choose different choices
It shows them that there's narrative built into the world
And so incentivizes them to explore more
It also incentivizes them to play it again because then they need to figure out when and actions and that's the first time
That's brilliant dude
That's a great great first time. Oh shit. Okay, um, all right. How do we do that to me on the force scene?
Oh
You played them all the times. Fuck now. I played it once and then I watched my streamer my streamer when he did it
Make different choices and he was able to convince them so I just shot the chairman in the face
Oh, dude, I I talked everyone, but in the end there's only two choices. No, so I mean that's what I meant
It sucks. I took the power. No, there's no choice. You can't you can't kill them. No, there's a thought choice
If you go to the golden you take the power regulator from home
You go back to the city you talk to him and you talk about the food
You can convince him to step down
She moves in takes over the colony and you're ending what the fuck talks about how they get off of salt tuna
And the colony becomes independent because they grow their own food. Oh, shit
Yeah, my streamer did this and I was like what the fuck all because he clipped on an extra dialogue line that I had
But I ignored on my bridge, which one is that which one triggered it? So you have to
Take the power regulator from the botanical golden
You take it when you take it after the quest
Well, no, you have to do the quest where you get power to edgewater and you take the power regulator out of the botanical golden
You talk to whore. So I gave it I gave it to the pianist for council dargette
Oh, see you can't do it then you have to take it and give it to the city. Oh, and then you can then you talk to whore
You can she explains why did you do this and you tell her I needed the regulator she gets pissed off
This is my playthrough. I went back and I took the money
But when you go back to him that you get a dialogue option
To talk about the food and the disease because if you talk to the mayor
He talks about how the villagers out of the town have a plague
And you find out there's a plague born into the town if he talked to okay. We're gonna call the people
I made a choice. I'm game it and if you do that you can actually make them unite together
Ah, it was damn because what happens is you explain but I was so close. I took the wrong one
I thought I thought I thought I thought I was literally one conversation piece away, but I was in a hurry so I skipped it
But literally all you have to do is go talk about the food and eventually it breaks off a path
Well, he's not talking about nutrition. I built a doctor dude. I built a head high intelligence. Hi
I uh mechanical skill like I don't dialogue heavy, you know
He convinced me on intimidating and but I did all the interactions, right? I was like yeah
Doing right doing great and then suddenly there's this choice. I'm like
Well, can I can they work together? Can they get that little my streamline is can I make them work together?
But you you have to do it immediately you can't do it gradually
I thought I could I thought I could convince them talk to them more
Like hey, why don't you join these guys or hey? Hey, I can talk to the citizens of the city like hey
Why don't you guys join us here? I can help you we can we can we can work to develop to build we can work work
We can work together to develop a community. Oh, so I know so you can't go that far
You can't interact that no show the brainwash. You got a number. No, I mean you can't. They're not right. They don't they've talked to bartender
She's wonderful
Everyone is I'm talking about the workers. Oh, no, everyone there is a nice thing. They should be real people for the knot. No, no, so
They're more on that phone the game. Have you I got the ship? Have you got some more? Okay? I know when you get some more
You find out that the board
Runs propaganda campaigns and it tells the citizens what to think
Those are religion call the scientific OSI. Wait, do you think if I come back to the sit to that clamped pilot later? It'd be different
Um, do you think they'll be able to help anyway? It changes your narrative at the end of the game
So if they go back there, there's gonna be stock their aesthetic. Well, no
So at the end of the game it does what followed the legacy will went to each place you went and it explains your interaction and how it affected it
So on mine because I talked to him. I told him look. He pushed for people to hold they left because you're an asshole
He got softer on them. He got realistic and
They became more productive. They became happier. They became a happy town. How the shit? How do I get him? I missed that too. What the fuck?
No, so what I did is I took the power from the botanical godans one to the two
Littins convinced them both to come back so everyone else came back
Adelaide stayed by herself in the godans. Everyone knows move back to town
And then when I talk to the mayor of Thompson Rude, I sort of look you're pushing the people to hold if you don't fix it
They're gonna do this again and next time we're gonna fix it
And so he realizes okay, I've been pushing too hard
And he pulls back a little bit on them and then in my ending playthrough it talks on my city was happy. I'm gonna re-play the game now
I can't I can't I can't just look at those two forces doesn't know the quest that does the same thing that I've got on accident
I know but I gotta redo it because I want to see that ending
No, I mean halfway through the game. There's another quest that does this
I didn't realize it. I found it on accident
He was a binary choice and by fucking around and talking to him. I made them come to an agreement
I pretty much said look I can just kill you both
Or you can walk together or I can take one
And it was something like okay, we'll come doing the code I guess
Because that's what I told the guy. I'm like look I have enough weapons
I could kill your whole town and then go kill the other one
So you guys come doing the code or I'll check this out


# REC015.txt
There's a difference when conversation, then if you have it, no one shows up.
Also, if we have it, and then someone opens the door, we pause.
And then the conversation restores, typically it picks back up, but sometimes it restores
based off of what that door pulls and drinks.
So they used to say, well, I hope...
Well, don't really do it so boldly, because we have to figure out who will
the player interact with, and at what time, because we've got to build the sequence of events.
I think that we can do that, but it's got to be like this, and it's got to be gradual.
No, but I'm talking about four stories, one you can also dress, draw, talk down,
or you'll get tired of it.
Yeah, so I'm trying to guess.
So I'm going to...
You're going to put this one in the middle, so we know that this is our main piece of action
that we're discussing.
We're discussing, as I'm in this room, but also the tower around us.
So, because that's the thing, is you kind of want to build the wall.
So the thing is, I want you to get this context, because this is the doughnut where you see it.
You're just going to imagine there's something here.
Imagine that the swarm of...
Oh, so that's not something you're explaining to us.
That's what I'm sorry about.
I need its ports in there.
So the doughnut.
So the diced swarm of stars.
They're making these doughnuts, and they're setting towards the center of the gas.
Okay, but...
And they gather them gathering in a large net.
So that would affect these people right now.
But we do need to explain that.
But you might want to put that in your back pocket for a second.
Okay.
Because you're able to play, it was just like you got to room...
Right, I'm going to fire out around like that, you're right.
So I need to...
We're not that you're going before.
You're going to see this.
Because you got to envision yourself walking behind the plate of the whole gas.
So you have to figure out what are the details you need to cover, what are the details you need to see.
Because we don't need to throw everything at them right now.
We want to kind of see what's along for them as we go.
But that's what I had.
That's what was sort of...
Because this is giving us a way to make the interact...
This is not working.
This is not...
I mean, it's scale-wise.
It works, but we need to be focusing up here, right?
No.
No, you do this.
Because this is all gathered throughout the fight again.
But you're not using the entire gas.
No, but we're using it as a framework for the narrative.
Okay.
Because if all they know is this galaxy in that single store...
...it's not supposed to be in the world.
We're just trying to build the narrative and then we'll have to figure out what we want.
Right now, it's kind of like building a puzzle.
We don't need all the pieces in the exact order they need to go.
We just need to get the pieces up right now.
There's two of the pieces.
The four contacts would be the map that you're going to figure.
So...
So here's what I'm trying to...
Here's what I'm trying to explain of this.
There isn't everything.
All we're doing is trying to flesh out the boundary lines of all the little story right now.
No, I got that.
I understand that.
This is...
No, this is to me.
No, let's say nobody could add a dead in them with the sticky notes.
That's true.
Okay.
So, imagine that for contacts...
...skill, really.
Let's say that...
We don't really need to worry about that.
Let's say that this...
...just heard kind of...
...visual contacts.
This is the...
...atmosphere.
Okay.
So, this is the...
This is the four-way view.
This is the top-down view.
What the cities look like.
This is the Galaxy view.
And this is the real-world story.
So, the next one we need to build is the construction area, well...
...AEI, the player.
And the person is going to be...
...and then they'll path to that area.
Because I don't forget, we're also going to build into paths.
We're out.
Okay.
So, we need that as well to explore that.
How much space do you think we should have to be okay?
Imagine the hub being somewhere here.
So, we don't really need to...
No, if you want to build a map, like Dirtual's map.
This is the 3D slice.
Remember, you want to talk about this.
You want to get this layout, right?
I just want to put paths.
Hey, lumbars, I'm not going to get it.
You're cruising games.
No, what I mean is...
What I'm talking about is...
...you suddenly don't have vehicles to build.
It's literally going to space a little further.
So, when you build your map, consider that in mind...
...the way of moving around.
That's what I was trying to figure out.
Because that's going to change the narrative of when the person can...
...marry and walk into the city...
...we're using the charm to the city.
It's going to control the narrative...
...because both taking a track...
...was his walking.
You're going to notice more walking than if you're taking a track...
...on a track, maybe more folks than the conversation.
But when you walk, you focus on the destination and the conversation.
Because if they're on a track, they're just going to be buzzing by still.
Okay, so, watch the destination of VBN.
Destination is the answer.
They're working towards exploring the area.
They want to.
They want to turn it on to explore Marin and the AEI...
...specifically destination after they leave the office.
Where are they going?
Oh, okay. So, let's say that...
The player is planning with that.
The player has a body now.
And so, they've been sent to...
They've found a way to...
...capoeil where they go.
Where are they going?
She's going to build him legs.
Build them...build them legs.
So, kind of a level doesn't have legs.
The player doesn't have legs.
They're being carried by this character.
So they're being carried?
Is the character walking or taking a vehicle?
They're walking with some stabilization equipment.
So then that's going to alter the narrative.
You're going to be either facing outwards from them,
seeing ahead, or you're going to be facing ahead.
What if you were playing a little set of wheels,
making me look around now?
Okay, so she's bright and temporary legs.
So where are they going?
They've changed our buildings.
She's going to workshop.
Okay, so we'll describe the path to a workshop.
Is it far beyond the idea of why you need to be straight?
Is it busy?
Is there traffic on it?
Is there other people that are going to be acting?
What are some of the significant things that are going to be locked in the past?
Is it going to be construction, tower, buildings?
Is it going to be like, go ahead and do something to be home?
What is the area she's walking through?
Is it in dust or oil?
Is it in the dead show?
Where is it over towards the base?
It's basically just a statue.
So, can I do it here?
So, about the structure being as it is,
it's pretending on the space,
because I don't know if it works.
So, here's a question.
Does she have stairs to the office?
Or is that a flat path for the main entrance?
Does she have stairs?
She has stairs.
There she's above the main area.
I imagine there's a little shop down here.
Oh, so there's another interaction place.
So, great.
Trigger plundry.
She or her home is down here.
So, I don't know.
What?
Trigger plundry.
So, this is another interaction.
So, we have two interactions right here.
She has to put on the new legs.
So, this is going downstairs.
This is to downstairs the bottom.
Yeah, but you said she has wheels.
So, I mean, she has to carry them down with stairs.
So, let's say that there's...
They plan for it.
So, this thing is not actually a wheel.
It's like a...
Oh, so, it can adapt to stairs.
Yeah.
So, it can adapt down.
It's adaptive.
Okay.
So, then, what we need, then,
all the trigger plundry we have,
then it's opening the legs onto the body.
Yeah.
The reason is...
So, let's write that down on some of the view.
Because that's important,
because that is a break in action,
where we can force into the dialogue
to keep the player busy,
while not involving the player.
You shift the camera view
so the player knows of those motions,
and then you have them talk
like she's setting it up,
or asking questions,
maybe ask questions about the legs.
So, that way the player knows what's going on.
Okay.
So, because you said the player can talk.
If the player was forward,
this is a...
Point.
It's notation.
It's notation A.
I need to explain the...
What?
The rock will start through the sand,
and follow up.
And here I saw with joy
what seemed to promise further traces of the ending.
Well, this here's what I'm trying to figure out.
Q will be on the face of the people in view.
With an unscathed both the sides
of several small swathed areas
of the ancient world.
Those interiors, my concern,
is watching these two talks.
Those swathes come into long,
since they're asked to fit on,
and then she's interacting with the sand.
I would have them interact
and go and smash open the door
and ask them to give me.
But I cleaned one with my spade,
and there's no one to waste them.
They're the ones that I received,
or at least one of them.
Maybe you don't have those outside,
so only have I received...
I think I missed both of them out,
and I'm going to use them.
Is that what they said on the back?
Is that a chick that's coagusted, though?
What's going on?
Pillers, insects.
You want to back them?
Seriously?
No, tell me about this.
No, they're talking.
There's no such a new door here.
No, I know there's a basket here.
You don't need to see that.
I'm talking about the tricky door here.
I had an invisible door.
It's like a hallway.
But the solutions have an open door,
so there's no such thing.
For I can hardly read the needle up,
to this area, if it was locked here,
or it's a door.
It's a door.
Okay, but what would that be?
It's a door.
This is a house.
Why would it still be all such jizzies?
Forgotten rights.
It's a chair floor.
It's a floor.
It's an inexplicable niche.
Okay, but just trying to talk more about it.
Okay, but if we're in here,
talk.
There wouldn't have anything open.
No, no, it's a place.
All that the place can be.
I'll try to keep the clothes for her.
I find what the other two are.
So there's a clarius trap to you.
What I'm saying to show the office, they don't think I can see me in the other floor right now.
I'm talking about some work about this from the long moon campus.
The fire was on the back.
She's installing the legs.
In the twilight.
There's another aperture coming to the real cold.
It's like finding more vague stones as symbols.
Because we need to convey the motion happening around.
So we know what the interaction is.
We're not going to have someone screaming if it's a constant scene.
There you go.
Yes, I'm calm.
Just action.
Do you want me to shoot?
About the shrine that's crying.
When the noise of a wind and of my camel outside open the stones.
And drew me forth to see why I put his fright in the beast.
What are you trying to do?
The moon is moving vividly over the planet.
So it's close to the Earth instead of blowing on the shield by a strong wind.
And decreasing wind from some point along the cliff ahead.
I knew it was this chilly sand.
You figure it out.
What are you doing?
I was about to leave it in place.
The same as the cardboard is back.
I changed it.
Yes.
And saw that there was no wind on top of it.
This is stung.
It made me fearful.
And I immediately recall the sudden local winds I had seen and heard before.
Some rise and suns it.
And judged it was a normal thing.
I also have twilight inside of this museum.
I decided that some rock fisher leading to a cave.
And watched the troubled sand to trace it to its source.
Soon proceeding that it came from the black orifice of the temple
a long distance south that we almost out of sight.
Let me see how you describe it.
The shadow of the sand clout I planted toward this temple.
Yes.
Which I'm interested in, right?
The larger than the rest.
And showed a door way far away.
That's what I'm trying to explain.
We need sand.
Or sand.
It's a woman door into the door.
Such as you see it just told me.
Because maybe we have the person in the living signal.
And so there is a strange ingredient.
It goes with the toilet as an excuse.
They see it.
They see the thing.
And they see a woman goes to the back.
They don't know what's back there.
But they see something back there.
But the presence.
Because that's when they come back to that office later on in the game.
They know to go to that back room.
But you didn't tell them to go to the bathroom.
Well, you showed them.
I was more afraid than I could explain.
You're right.
But when you're in the game, you're going to have visual in a walkway.
So we don't want to put everything down or down.
Okay.
What we're trying to do is just paint a loose portrait of a sequence of events.
So then we can go to narrow it.
Yeah.
Okay.
So, okay.
Before you start tearing up more sheets from that small one,
we've got to use these cycles.
So we've got to use the ones we got.
Okay.
Sorry.
You think they're going to find more paper for this shit.
It's like six months of book.
I have so many.
I have so many.
Yes.
This one.
I know you know, someone had ideas.
But we've got to just stay focused on them.
A little threat right now.
As you're getting to teleport.
Focus back on what we were doing.
So many tangents.
We'll build it.
I know.
That's why we're doing that.
We've got to build it.
That's where we're going to get to.
Just slow the bit.
This is the slowest down.
That's why I made you jog the office.
Because it slows us down.
It knows we're dead.
We know we can't believe this office.
Okay.
So we have to talk to the other soul.
It's just a joke.
You know we're not going to stop it.
To those remote areas when it's time to go to the office.
Because it slows us down.
We know we can't believe this office.
Okay.
So we have to talk to the other soul.
It's just a joke.
And I'm going to ask you now.
To those remote areas, this is what you're doing.
It's just a joke.
We're doing what we're doing.
So what we're doing is to have she's taking from the office
support within.
We're holding a black tunnel.
So we're ready to try and get an entire schedule.
I've got a little wrong map.
The only thing to see in these maps,
we just need to top down with the pouches from the tables.
We don't need to know everything on the path,
or I can't even build that in the narrative.
But the path is also where we should rest in peace.
And it is because I've been so busy.
You're jumping to your forehead.
We've got a build for most of these deaths,
and then we'll build the awards.
There's need for the pouches going to box
as it belongs to the desert from the land.
So that's what I mean.
Before we build the rest,
we've got to build a story for you.
It's like sketching before you pack.
You've got to do a slight sketch there.
We know what we're going to do.
We're not free-handing.
We're not free-handing.
It's a steep passage, feet first.
There's no one on that.
Let's say to this thing.
Because only in the terrible weather,
it doesn't have to be exact.
It just has to be something that can get us tough.
We're having a schedule, right?
Don't worry about a schedule.
Well, I have a narrow schedule.
It's part of what they're in,
some of the battles like us.
But right now,
we just need a path to the towards me,
where the dots could not lie.
They were connected to the dots.
We're not drawing a picture where it's connected.
I lost track of the art,
and I never got to consult my wife,
though I was frightened.
So then now,
we just need a path that takes you to the workshop.
That we challenge as a direction,
and of steepness.
And once I came to a long,
terrible passage,
where I discussed this,
afterwards,
along the rocky floor,
holding my torch and arms,
and I was beyond my head.
The place was not high enough.
It was the past straight after
when we moved on with the steps.
And I was still scrambling down,
interminably,
when my failing torch died.
It was a bit of a nightmare.
So,
is it going to be such a nightmare?
It was a nightmare.
So, when I did notice it,
it was still holding it high.
I mean,
it was like,
wrongly loose or cause,
like you would see in a conventional city,
where his wife is on the road
or benches in the end.
So,
long,
long,
long,
honest,
dunes or fables.
And one of the things happened happened.
Here,
on that attic,
there,
there,
I was lucky enough
to think of something I musst
found when I discovered
something which was
decorated with mud.
Why do you find that?
Do I have a
good idea?
Can you feel the moisture of my
All that back, those two were forced to use from one of the ones that were leaving the
arthas.
We don't even need all of them.
So all we need right now is the path she takes, the path that should be the full
trail.
This is how to, and then that's what I can solve the path, and the path is more, until I
feel it.
So now we just want to draw the path that she starts on, and it's like, well, the path is
black.
This is what we have a direction to roll with the head, so then we just don't even know
what to do to see on this path.
I'm looking to look at foot might pass down through that pasm I saw beneath, as far
as vision could explore the jetty sides as smooth as glass, looking as if just varnished
over with that dark pitch.
Of course, really.
It's not that short.
It's more like a time and quite cease to exist when my feet are filled with the same
open.
I'm not sure if it's like a place like this.
I don't have the time to draw the exit from this, so we would calculate any far above
my head.
I could not quite stand, but could kneel upright, and in the dark I shuffled and crept
here.
This is the first and second floor.
I soon knew that I was in a narrow passage whose walls were lined with cases of one
floor, having glass fronts.
As in that paleozoic and the visible place I felt of such things as polished wooden glass,
I shuddered at the possible implications.
The cases were apparently arranged along each side of the passage of regular intervals,
and were oblong and horizontal, hideously like coffins in shape and size.
When I tried to move to a three for further examination, I found they were firmly fastened.
I saw that the passage was a long one, so floundered ahead rapidly in a creeping
run that would have seemed horrible at any eye-watched me in the blackness.
Crossing from side to side occasionally to feel of my surroundings and be sure the walls
and rows of cases still stretched on.
Man is so used to thinking visually that I almost forgot the darkness and picture the endless
corridor of wooden glass in its low-studded monotony as though I saw it.
And then, in a moment of indescribable emotion,
I did see it.
Just when my fancy merged into real sight, I cannot tell,
but there came a gradual glow ahead.
And all at once I knew that I saw the dim outlines of the corridor and the cases
revealed by someone.
So when he started to smell this, he was in a pitch black fuss for us all the way.
For a little while, all those kinds of times I was in hope.
He saw a glass.
You can see it all as it is.
He saw a glass and it would head into the stronger light.
I realized that my fancy had been but feeble.
This hall was no relic of crudity like the temples in the city above,
but a monument of the most magnificent and exotic art, rich, vivid,
and daringly fantastic designs and pictures formed a continuous scheme of mural painting
whose lines and colours were beyond description.
You see, this is like that city.
This is one of a strange golden wood with fronts of exquisite glass
and contained pieces of art.
This is the mother of five more beautiful creatures,
and I was particularly impressed.
This is the most chaotic dreams of man.
To convey any idea of these monstrosities is impossible.
They were of the reptile kind.
With body lines suggesting sometimes the crocodile, sometimes the seal,
but more often nothing of which either the naturalist or the paleontologist ever heard.
In size they approximated a small man,
and their forelegs bore delicate and evidently flexible feet,
curiously like human hands and fingers.
At strangest of all with their heads,
which presented a contour of violating all known biological principles,
to nothing can such things be well-compared.
In one flash I thought of comparisons as varied as the cat,
the bulldog, the mythic satyr,
and the human being,
not drove himself at so colossal and protruded forehead,
if the horns and the noselessness and the alligator-like jaw
placed the things outside all the established cannibals.
I debated for a time on the reality of the monkeys,
half-suspecting they were artificial idols,
but soon decided they were indeed some paleogen species,
which had lived with the name of the city to live.
To crown their grotesqueness,
most of them were bortiously enrobed in the costliest of fabrics,
and lavishly laid with ornaments of gold,
jewels, and unknown shining metals.
The importance of these crawling creatures must have been asked
if they held first some of the wild designs on the frescoe.
So what would you think if you went to an ancient city?
You went down the tunnel for,
you don't know how long,
you were just in this pitch black tunnel,
going down and down and down,
and then you found that,
oh, it's just a path that you have to crawl on.
So now you're crawling on your hands and knees,
you don't know how long it is,
you can't see.
It's this pitch black,
you're feeling your way along,
and it's a rough cut tunnel,
and then suddenly you come to like,
you could tell it's been walk-stone.
It's chiseled.
And then as you're going through this dark chiseled hole,
you still can't see anything,
where you can do this touch and see by feel.
And as you feel along,
you'll eventually start feeling,
edges and shapes on the wall like pictures.
And then it slowly changes
in these dark filling wood boxes of glass cases.
And then as you get to see,
well, there's finally like,
at the end of this massive tunnel,
you look in the case,
and it's a humanoid puzzle puzzle.
That's how he is right now.
He's like, oh,
and he can't play it off like,
oh, they're not actually human,
like, because they'll jack down and close,
and the jewels,
like Egyptian and the Pharaohs,
when they were baby.
They were buried in pretty much the same way
as the Egyptians.
And that's pretty much what he's found
underneath the ground,
and he doesn't know how long he's been going.
A wall and ceiling.
That's kind of what I'm about to imagine.
He's still banging on the road in the tail.
How much time has he had?
He's guarding the fashion to suit their dimensions.
And I could not but think that their pictured history
was allegorical,
perhaps showing the progress of the race that pushed him.
These creatures, I said to myself,
were to the man of the name of the city
what the she-wolf was to roam,
or some totem beast is to a tribe of Indians.
Holding this view, I thought I could trace roughly
a wonderful ethic of the name of the city,
that the tale of a mighty sea coast metropolis
that ruled the world before Africa rose out in the waves.
And of its struggles,
it's like, oh, this is an artificial thing
that I would want to roam and believe in.
I saw its wars and triumphs,
its troubles and defeats,
and afterward its terrible fight against the desert
when thousands of its people here represented in allegory
by the grotesque reptiles,
were driven to chisel their way down through the rocks
in some marvelous manner,
into another world where of their files
or in our natural portrait.
It was all vividly weird and realistic,
and its connection with the awesome descent I had made
was unmistakable.
I even recognized the passages.
As I crept along the corridor,
the right of the door.
I saw later stages of the painting.
A ventilation,
a leaf taking of the race that had dwells
in the city and the valley around for 10 million years.
The race was so strange,
with the seas, their bodies had known so long,
but they had settled as known as the world's youth,
queuing in the virgin rock,
to those kinds of shrines that which they never sought
to worship one being the Lord is the Lord.
No, but the light is better.
I studied the pictures more closely,
and all the earlier side reptiles must represent the unknown men,
pondered upon the customs of the nameless city.
Many things were peculiar,
and inexplicable.
Well, so here's my thing.
What is the story?
What is the story?
Which included a written-out decriminately written-out
to a viral order that knows it everably later,
as an independent definition in Bologna.
If there were curious, what was the story?
I could, for example,
at first you had no pictures to represent death,
so funeral customs,
saved such as were related to wars,
violence, and state of justice.
And I wondered if the reticent is shown
for a certain period of time.
It was as though an ideal of earthly immortality
had been fostered as a cheering elude.
Still nearer the end of the passage,
where painted scenes of the utmost picturesqueness
and extravagance,
where the third bottle of trust in the universe,
the name of the city and its desertion and growing ruin,
and of the strange new realm,
more paradise,
to which the race acued its way through the stone.
That's my corner.
In these views, the city and the desert valley
were shown always by moonlight,
but golden in the suffering of the fallen walls,
and half remaining the spell in perfection of former times,
shown respectfully and indecently by the artist.
The paradisal scenes were almost as dramatic as to be believed,
portraying hidden world of eternal day,
filled with glorious cities
and deferial hills and valleys.
The very last, I thought,
I saw a sign of an artistic anticlimax.
The paintings were less skillful,
and much more bizarre than even the wildest,
and the earliest scenes.
I mean, I think they seem to record slow decadence
of the ancient history of that.
A couple of the growing ferocity toward the outside world
perished was driven by the desert.
The forms of the people always represented by the sacred reptiles
appeared to be gradually wasting away,
though their spirit had shown hovering about the ruins
by moonlight, gained in proportion.
So the place where it started,
was displayed as reptiles and ornament roads,
cursed the upper air and all who preached.
There's one terrible final scene,
showed a primordial looking man,
a pack of hideeer of ancient durend,
the city of Peneternis, he's torn to a place
I don't know, and he was happy to be running away and saying what.
I remembered how the air,
the city of Peneternis,
and was glad that beyond this place,
the grey walls were ceiling up there.
As I viewed the pageant of mural history,
I had approached very closely the end of the low-sealed hall,
and was aware of the great gate
through which came all of the illuminating phosphorescence.
Creeping up to it, I cried aloud
and transcendent amazement of what lay beyond.
For instead of other and brighter chambers,
it was only an illimitable void of uniform ladies,
such as one my fancy when gazing down
from the peak of Mount Everest upon a sea of suner mist,
behind me was a passage so cramped
that I could not stand upright before me
was an infinity of subterranean effulgence.
Reaching down from the passage into the abyss
was the head of a steep flight of steps,
small numerous steps like those of the black passengers
I had traversed, but after a few feet,
the glowing vapor's casted look was easy.
Swung gravels, but against the left hand wall of the passage,
was a massive door of brass,
and decorated with fantastic barriers,
which could have closed,
shut the whole inner world of light away
from the vaults and passages rocked.
I looked at the steps,
and for the non-steered night tribe,
I touched the open brass door and could not move it.
Then I sank prone to the stone floor,
my mind aflame,
with prodigious reflections,
which are not even a death-like exhaustion,
but vanish.
As I lay still with closed eyes,
free to ponder,
many things I had likely noted in the frescoes
came back to me with new and terrible significance.
Scenes representing the nameless city in its haven,
and the distant lands,
with which its merchants traded.
The allegory of the crawling creatures
puzzled me by its universal prominence,
and I wondered that it should be so closely followed
at a pictured history of such importance.
The frescoes, the nameless city,
had been shown in proportions fitted to the reptiles.
I wondered what its real proportions
that magnificence had been,
and reflected a moment on certain oddities
I had noticed in the rules.
I thought curiously of the loneliness
of the primal temples and of the underground corridor,
which, without dishewn thus,
out of deference to the reptile deities
they are honored,
though it perforce reduced the worshippers to crawling.
Perhaps the very rights had involved
the crawling in the notation of the creatures.
No religious theory, however,
could easily explain why the level passage
in that awesome descent
should be as low as the temples,
or lower, since one did not have a meal.
As I thought of the crawling creatures
whose hideous, mummified form
they were so close to.
I felt a new throb of fear,
mental associations of curious,
and I shrank from the idea that,
except for the poor primitive man torn to pieces
in the last painting,
mine was the only human form
amidst the many relics and symbols
of primordial life.
But as always,
in my strange and groving existence,
one day soon drove out fear,
so on after the luminous abyss
and what it might contain,
but it presented a problem worthy
of the greatest explorer.
There being the weird world of mystery
lay far down that flight
and I'm too nearly small,
and I hope to find there
which is going to worry
or which the painting court
had failed to get on the doorway.
The frescoes have pictured
unbelievable cities
whose new vows
and snow were one of them.
So this is my fancy,
and it feels like the stairwell
that's lost,
and it's weak buried down.
Less like this,
but now here's a deep,
I can certainly pass
in my opinion.
It's almost like one,
not even the physical horror
of my position in that,
it's cramped,
or your days of trials,
and to have the frescoes
or miles in the shadow
of the world I knew wouldn't face
by the door of a living,
or life like this.
Could match the people's red
eye-feld,
and ancient,
so vast,
ancient,
notable,
seem to lear down
from the pride of the stone,
and rocky antennaes
in the name of the city.
On the very outside
of this town,
the maps of the frescoes
and the spiritual shadow
caught on the list
that had this fountain
with only here and there,
some vaguely familiar
outside.
So what could have happened
in the geological
eons of the painting's face,
and the death-hating race
resentfully succumbed to decay,
no man might say.
Life had once teemed
in these caverns,
and in the luminous realm
beyond.
Now, I was alone
with vivid relics,
and I trembled to think
of the countless ages
through which these relics
had kept a silent,
and deserted,
visual stations.
Suddenly,
there came another burst
of that ancient fear,
which had intermittent
pieces,
and the ever since I first saw
the terrible valley,
and the nameless city
under God's will.
Despite my exhaustion,
I found myself
starting frantically
to a sitting pass
with an amazing back
along the black corridor
toward the tunnels
that rose to the outer world.
My sensations were much
like those which had
made me shun the nameless city
at night,
and were as inexplicable
as they were.
In another moment,
however, I received
still greater shoggy
in the form of a definite sound.
The first which had broken
the other silence
of these two light depths.
It was a deep,
low moaning,
as a distant throng
of condemned spirits
had changed from the direction
in which I was staring.
It followed you rapidly
through till soon,
the reverberating
on my shoulder,
a little passage,
playing at the same time,
I became conscious
of an increasing draft
of cold air,
likewise flowing
from the tunnels
and the city above.
The touch of this air
seemed to restore my balance.
For I used to recall
the sudden gust
which had risen
around the mountain
of this each sunset
and sunrise,
one of which had indeed
served to reveal
the hidden tunnels to me.
I looked at my watch,
and saw that sunrise
was near,
so braced myself
to resist the gale,
which was sweeping down
with cav and home,
as it had swept forth.
But there is movement.
My fear again waned
it.
Since a natural
could it be known
to exist so that
the distance of
the patule could take the
minutes.
More and more badly
poured the shrieking
moaning night wind
into that bell
for the inner
aesthetic.
I dropped pro again
and touched vaguely
in the floor for fear of
being swept bodily
through the open
gates of the
phosphorus
and actresses.
Such fury
seemed unexpected
and as I grew aware
of an actual slipping
of my form
toward the abyss,
I was told
by a thousand new
tensions
of apprehension.
Purple
from a sheet
purple
from a glass
to winking
of a feather
and once more I could
hide myself
shudderingly
into that
corner.
I tried to crawl
against the murder
as invisible torrent,
but I could not
even
think of rage
all the storm
because it was
largely impotent.
I think I screamed
fantically
in the last
I was always
out of control.
But if I diesel,
my cries were lost
in the hell-born
dabble
of the howling wind
rays.
I tried to crawl
against the murder
as invisible torrent,
but I could not
even hold my own
as I was pushed
slowly and in extra
bit toward the
unknown world.
Finally,
reason must have
hold.
For I fell
to babbling over
and over that
unexplainable
couple of the
mad air about how
should it be?
There's a gateway.
And suddenly the
gateway is
reaching the end.
And with
a revolving death
may die.
And it's
born to
reimbruiting desert
gods.
And there was nothing
in the dark
on the door.
And now it's
so
completely
now it's
pulling around.
And all is
remembered
in the nightweight
till oblivion
or worse
claims me.
Monstrous,
unnatural,
colossal was the
thing.
Too far
beyond all the
ideas of man to be
believed, except
in the silent
damnable small
hours when one cannot
sleep.
I have said that
the fury of the
Russian blast was
in my friend.
Pack into
maniacal.
And that it's
voiceless,
genius, no doubt.
And this is the
desolity
traumatized.
So I have a
presently those voices
while still
chaotic before me.
Seen to my
beating brain to
take
articulate form
behind me.
And so I
were there in the
grave.
I am

Okay.
Lovecraft has an interesting means of conveying character through interaction.
Well, not just code, but it's in the world itself.
He has a very unique style of showing, but not telling.
Oh, you are.
He shows you through like descriptive dialogue.
Instead of saying it's an old tomb.
He's using feelings.
Yeah, he expresses, well, he uses events to tie the theme.
Because that story took place in Egypt, or a desert planet.
And so he mentioned Mesopotamia.
He mentioned Babylon.
But he never said, well, you will.
He said Mesopotamia was still young and with bricks of Babylon was baked yet.
That gives you an age of a few thousand BC, but it doesn't tell you when.
He didn't tell you, oh, it was this date.
He makes you a little bit to the details, and you connect the dots.
So it feels like a puzzle you're unwinding.
It's really good analogy.
Like this, like how he describes on the city to us.
But it's the care of the talking, so.
Okay, so, oh, you want to go back?
Let me just try it.
So, keep going.
You want to pause for a bit?
Yeah.
Because it is interesting.
I really like it.
I need more examples.
More context of how this dialogue is going.


# REC017.txt
Good?
Yeah?
Nice and smooth.
That was a good hit, too, because you just have to knock off some of the ATHC.
That's the thing I got to remember is this one doesn't mean anything.
Wow, that play was amazing, now.
So, what I think you should do when you are showing the play over the wall is don't tell them what they look like.
Well, tell them what the wall is.
So many games make not even games or even movies today.
They tell you things like, oh, it's, it's called, oh, it's a bad town.
They don't elude to how it's about town.
The character just mentions, oh, this is a bad neighborhood.
Lovecraft, the way he shows that places are dangerous.
Take for example, he did a story about, he was a grave keeper.
He would bury the people.
And the story took place from his perspective of having to care for the tomb the night.
And felt the story he had referencing one of the coffins was off.
Like, it didn't look like he should fit.
The person who was maize for, because the person that they put in the coffin seemed bigger than what we've been there.
And by the end of the story, it turns out that the guy was building substandard coffins.
And he cut off that dude's feet.
Because the end of the story is he stuck calling out and the guy's army chews up his feet.
You don't have a lot of stories that have overall branching narratives.
So it's like, you have top ones.
So we're trying to establish the main characters right now.
We're trying to establish the initial action.
That's great. It's perfect. We should do that.
But I think we should also establish the overall thematic direction using plot points.
So what I want to establish here, let's say plot.1.
You are a dodeck, you can't observe.
As soon as you can see others, they'll talk to you, they'll interact with you.
You can't interact yet.
As soon as you go into the bathroom, you see the mirror, you see your hands,
and then you can back out.
You interact with characters again.
And then you're going downstairs.
You're exploring the space downstairs. I want to design that space still.
It could be the repair shop.
Or it could be just another social space. It could be another.
It could be a fireplace.
I don't know.
You're not extending the scene too long because they wasn't getting bored.
You're just watching cutscenes.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Imagine you're in a kitchen, it's a dining room, it's the rest of the house.
I know, but you don't want to wrinkle at you all, I know.
I mean, this is important because I need to re-
I need to decrease the scope.
The scope can't be too large. I'm going to be careful about how far I expand.
So it's more of a careful consideration for how the player interacts with content,
how the player explores.
And using the exploration as it means to encourage more playtime.
Encourage slow and courage.
It's curious.
No, they can slip.
They can slip.
Remember, they can slip through the task space, and then they give them legs.
I know, but then they can walk around.
They want to explore the legs.
So they walk outside, they walk in the dining place, and then the door opens.
Okay, but what I'm going to explain is if they don't have anything to do,
they're not going to be interested.
Okay, let's say that downstairs.
There's going to be another walking simulator.
Okay, I got an idea.
Okay, what if, in that in relation to that, remember how we'll met?
Who's in there right now?
Uh, Sorrell's in there.
And Sorrell, as the player leaves,
leaves with Kolesa.
All right.
She pinged that in to the player.
Because these two are close.
Kolesa and Sorrell are close.
So how do you establish that?
Sorrell, I've said that his point would be over and about.
Or his point would be over soon.
We're almost ready.
Can you, you want to come and talk?
Yeah, towards.
They're there.
And we each other there.
So who's texting who?
Sorrell is texting Kolesa.
Okay.
Or not, or Kolesa is texting Sorrell.
And that's...
She's in there, be style of things.
She wants to help him work.
Does she encourage him to do this?
Um...
She leaves my loan until it's over.
Right, but their friends, they want to hang out.
Oh no, here's how it is.
It's stepping back.
Uh, therapy is not a social stigma.
It's not stigmatized.
It's a stigma.
It's a stigma.
It's moral privacy.
There's no need for total privacy in this situation.
It's not about total privacy.
Therapy is normal.
Therapy is normal.
Therapy is about a conversation between two people.
If that is the reason why would you inject
in the middle of that process?
What if they're also...
They also consider themselves to be helping.
Well, why not just wait for them to come out?
For their friends that are understanding.
Why not just wait for them to come out?
Well, that's what you don't need to have.
They'll be at text.
You can just come out of the room.
But they need to know that they're planning to hang out
after my therapy is over.
Well, you just haven't mentioned it when it comes up to them.
So that way the player was involved.
Because if you do a text and you have to somehow
illustrate the text to the player,
if you just haven't come out and talk.
Yeah, that's talking to them.
You can still convey it to the player when you don't have to.
What would they say?
What would they say?
Do you think?
How would you convey that information?
You don't have to necessarily say everything.
You can imply it.
And I think the implication that these characters act on
is more interesting than outright saying it.
So imagine, this is their path they have internally.
But the player doesn't know this.
They have to infer that it's too close to the friends.
And they've interacted together in a way that's reasonable.
Like, hey, they don't say this,
but you can infer that they're going to hang out
after their therapy is over.
Like, just say it always too long.
And then you understand that conversation break off.
Yeah, I'll be selling.
Let's, you won't come with me.
And they're like, yeah, and then they hang out.
Well, they come to the credit system.
They're like, hey, oh, hey, there you are.
Or no.
I could be like, oh, hey, do you think you're thinking about it?
OK, well, why isn't pooling that the player
knows that they hang out?
What if Cliff asks if she can hang out
with your therapist right now?
Your therapist over?
Like what if Cliff asks, OK?
Hey, are you feeling it?
When I hang out?
Hey, how are you feeling when you want to hang out?
I was just, that's just doing the whole thing.
You're not wanting to say it.
Well, there you go.
You don't say anything at all.
You just let that interact.
Don't say anything.
Later, space doesn't make a difference.
No, but you don't think that that is...
No, you have to let curiosity, the characters,
and the background of the characters.
And you can do that.
You want to convey that they want to hang out.
You don't have to say, hey, let's hang out.
Exactly. You don't say anything.
You can talk about the entity that is just
walking up in your area.
You can just talk about them saying let's hang out.
They had planned hang out.
It's a coincidence that the thing actually woke up at this time.
No, but what he just recorded was you saying, hey, let's hang out.
If we're trying to avoid directly saying that.
Okay, what if she comes in?
Oh, hey, it's awake.
Okay, so now we've changed the scope.
We're talking about him and Ho.
Interacting in front of the AI, different trade.
Okay, but they'll set the back, set the back, set the back, set the back.
Let's say, okay.
Because we're hoping again.
So we're trying to establish...
You can do more of the thing I said.
Just spring it back.


# REC018.txt
So what I'm doing here, what I'm doing wrong is that I'm
Connecting these two characters for the intent that they are to hang out, but I am
Also also needed to connect that the event of this character
As a wolf in these guys are attracted these guys are attracting and these two branch off they get on stairs
Surprise because I was going to be by the AI so he's going to be curious about what's going on
So you don't need to talk to him you can just have him come into the situation naturally
Has him come in and then you have them have the conversations that are talking about the AI
Because you said you want to do branches. Yeah, branches. So demonstrate those branches to the play over what they do
So imagine we talk about the AI to
Marina or Maria whatever that mission is
And have Melissa jump in and ask if they're still hanging out imagine those that the commosations branch
Interesting idea here. Okay, they're don't like right the symbols though. They don't
So all right
Imagine
That the symbols
When someone talks they it pops up above their head right the symbol appears in the first time you see curiosity
when
The player wakes these characters
Carden and Melissa curiosity curiosity
One than the other and then film it later on you're talking whatever curiosity it sees you
You think huh and then he also sees something else
You see the symbol for distrust why does he just trust the Dodeck?
It's
He said this is
Or not distrust maybe it's what's the other one there's okay. There's enmity empathy a
Version attraction anger aggression
I think you're trying to just put too much
This is how it's right here gets there
But you don't have to show it all on the whole scene you can show it on the street no no the player uses this is language
So imagine you can show this on the street. You don't need to have one more have a second symbol
If you're going to the street
You can show that second symbol in passing no wrong. It's it's it's only seen through the player's perspective
That's what I mean you don't need to throw all this at the magic
Imagine like you you see those symbols right you see those two symbols. That's it
You don't see those two you see the curious symbol you see others somebody don't it. Why does he don't know emotion?
You don't know to that with some others. Why is there another emotion because it needs to convey more information
He's out really curious but he's internally what what's his internal hot process?
Why because
emotions are more complex than just
Aggression and
I get what you're trying to do but why would he have it to a Dodeck if it's someone everyone accepts
It's a process that happens in your brain internally. You can't control it
No, but why what do you have it you already said that they accept it? It's it's there
It's like implicit. It's an incident. Plus it. Maybe it's not
So no, so maybe it's crazy, dude
Let me show you I
Got to show you killing your own narrative
So do you know it is at the
It's like being angry and hungry you have you're hungry, right? It's combination. It's another word
There's 150 words plus word. Why does he have a second one?
Because it's a behavior is an interacting together to make a outcome wasn't interested in the object their force
Hang on, dude. Okay
So
Yes
Are you jumping in context? No, you're jumping up and down
Okay, no, I guess you don't agree the 12 sides and then you take three days combined to make a make a make a feeling
To make a make an expression to make a to make him I know what you're trying to say. Yes
Okay, so three. He's pop up at once. These are you have curiosity immediately and you have another one
Where's the other one?
Everyone doesn't have to be distressed. It can be the one that said distressed though. It's attraction
I did but I I was trying to explain it didn't have to be building me a note of when you're getting mad
I'm following the narrative. I'm not mad. I'm just trying to explain this better
No, you're like giving me one and then you're changing and then you're getting frustrated
You're trying you're criticizing your criticizing you're criticizing correctly, but I'm trying to criticize
I'm just trying to figure out why is there a second emotion being attached
But then you're criticizing that second notion and that's exactly what you should be doing
Right, and if I'm not a Christian, it's just the question of what you're questioning it
And then I'm saying that that's not quite right. That's not quite I'm trying to express it. That's not quite right
That's not quite I'm trying what that needs to be so because you're making points
So I'm trying to better articulate that this second expression
It's internally motivated
Okay person. I can't control it
There are so such things through well. It's an expression out there
Okay, so you throw in the free will thing and then again, I know we'll go out of free will
Well, it's let's say it's it's the affect of your emotion
Okay, so why do the other ones have this happen too?
It happens every one
Every one of these is having the woman as a symbol
The second one pops up and let's say this person is a symbol
But it's just immediate curiosity is the biggest you can have one two three
Okay, depends on intensity and intensity for them. It's it's it's it's immediate curiosity
So you're saying that the others are feeling the same emotion as well, but you're not feeling the same emotion
They feel more senseless, so I imagine
I'm not saying why have they only portrayed one symbol, but he's portraying two
What is the difference there?
Because he experiences a little more complex emotions
It's not that's not a bad thing. No, but what is he imagine? Okay, imagine
Have you seen such a secret? You know a symbol pop up? Yeah, so why are you making this like a calm a contest?
It's not a contest. This isn't journaling the player. This is communication. This is language
This is they can't be saying because he's focused second genitalities for the more complex the player can use words to communicate
He's your symbols. No, I know that. Well, I'm talking about one month symbol
Uh, but
You didn't see the symbols. I'm sure you saw it all talking about will make so you say woman's fill fill
Has having a more complex set of films because he's having a second symbol
Yeah, the second symbol wouldn't that be the same for them?
No, since they're more interested in the dough that wouldn't show curiosity and something else like maybe
Oh, oh
Okay, that's a good point. Okay, let's say okay. Let's let's let's do
one character shows extreme curiosity that would be cardin
Because he's interacting with
Marian and then
Calissa has
Elation in curiosity. She's happy surprised, but she's
Not as intensely curious as cardin
That's not a bad thing. It's just how her knowledge of the situation. We don't have to just say anything
But that's why I'm justifying it's like half half. There are two emotions there. So she's curious
Well, she's also happy really happy about it
And then because she's aware that these things are cool. She likes a lot or whatever
Um, and then you have cardin
You know, he's he's curious and Tancy curious about it. So he wants more. I can't wait to eat and then
As soon as Calissa pops out you see a second notion
Desire
And
The secondary so you have the the interaction her being there
replaces the intense
Uh
What do you call it? The
The intense curiosity kind of halves it because now he's still interested to curious, but he's also
Attracted this person
Uh, that's not necessarily an exceptional traction. It's also a traction as in social traction
I don't know what she means, but who's attracted to who
Uh, cardin is attracted to
Marian, but isn't she supposed to do getting therapy? No, Marian comes in. She's the engineer
My bad, I'm at the service. And then Calissa is the the person next to the friend of cardin. It's
Interested. Okay. No, I got through the issues mixed up in my head and happy and then there's will met who is
Uh, so woman is curious. He's by himself from the room. I remember these simple
Calissa's friend is next to her who will sit here and begin her that is in the therapy session. Yeah
The dude that is with Calissa also has a crush on the engineer
And we have an established the therapist yet. Okay, so those two
erasine and
What's that?
Surrell
So the way I would convey that this is a therapist type of setting
is
After he leaves
Maybe don't necessarily say on his therapy
Maybe it's asked how did the session go
Because session has a wide setting so you could have it be a variety of things
You're right, and that's a more of a what's more casual how to go, you know? Yeah
Well, you want to kind of hand that there's something going on in the office because then it explains why there's so many very people sitting in this room
It's okay
So
You have to put a plot on the events
What else could we do here? We need a second for us. We need us to try to
certainly hop around
Let's get this reticulated
So


# REC019.txt
I don't know, when you read to a tricky like this, it's like, let's look on this track
closer again.
So I don't want you to miss that in the next track, yeah.
So I need to draw, so we have, we need to draw right now, we need to figure out, we need
the floors as, as, as context for certain events.
What's up?
We need the floors as context.
We want to know, so before we get to the second floor, we need, well, I know, we
are going to draw this and then we're going to draw it to the point that they're
interacting with that.
No, no, but folks, we need to plot out the interaction in the top store right now.
Okay.
Because right now we have all this actions we want to do, so we need to write a scene in
the sheet.
It's bullet, bullet pointed like you're in a screenplay.
Okay, how do you, oh, there's actually a storyboard in that, right?
Well, we can't just, we need to grab some sticky notes, we'll set them on to here.
Branch and storyboard.
Branch and storyboard.
Well, because, no, we got to figure out, scene one is, you wake up and you look around.
Scene two, you will have noticed.
The transition between scene one and scene two is, you hear the conversation between
the two sitting next to you.
Scene two is that noticing you and then you gain the ability to move around the room.
Once you get the ability to move around the room, we need to figure out scene three,
which is either talking to them, or you're not listening to interactions, you're actually
just giving the train events.
Yeah.
That's what we're trying to do right now.
Give the train events online.
Because once we get to the chain of events for a good out, we'll figure out the conversation
points.
And once we figure out the conversation points, we'll flush out the conversations by doing
a screenplay writing on the, because what I'm trying to do is get the, the flesh figured
out now of what the screen button needs to be, but to do that, I need to know the sequence
that an event's take place in.
We'll just add on as we go, because we'll start with that phenomenon.
Right.
Okay.
So first of all, we have the seed awakening.
Yeah.
I'm just fucking, don't use that on the wall.
Huh?
Don't use that.
Take that off the wall and write on this.
I don't want it bleeding through to the wall.
Okay.
Awakening is A or E?
Awakening.
Awakening.
A-W-A-K-E-N-I-M-G.
Yeah.
That's good.
Anyway.
That's in copy details.
See the Awakening.
So, uh, let's do the player point of view.
Let's do the player point of view.
Try and advance.
Well, we don't need to do the point of view on that.
We just need to do that.
No, it isn't kind of important.
I mean, it's like it's conveyed to us.
We're more worried about what they can do now.
So now, let's go away and then we can look around.
Because you said they're going to unlock as they go.
Yeah.
Because you said next they get their hands on the go to the bathroom.
So now, we've got to draw the sequence of events that leads into the bathroom,
which is the conversation between the two next to them,
and then either talking to one or the going moment.
So we don't need to convey everything on that right now.
We're just trying to pull up.
No, we're trying to pull up.
We're trying to pull up.
So you're right.
This is stupid.
I shouldn't be doing that.
I shouldn't be doing that.
It looks like you're actually building the game.
First person view of view.
You want to note that they can now move tethered movement.
So the next one is a locked event, you want to note that.
Locked event?
Where is Jesus ticking out on the wall?
Unlocked event?
Wait, let's just use the second one.
We have already fully stocked out of new ones.
Are you right here?
Do you want to run away from right in front of you?
No, I mean, why not?
I just have to use these ones before we start having new ones.
So this is the second new details before this?
And let me try to read my first time.
So the next step is he wakes up.
Okay.
Oh, okay, you're going to give him an axe.
Well, so he's obviously going to have to wake up and then you can move.
And then no matter what, he said the interaction with these two is locked.
Because they're going to notice you.
So now that he's noted, we have to figure out what happens next.
All right.
All right.
So in this space?
Well, so we might as well write down the conversation between those two.
Because no matter what, the players are going to be part of it because they're next to them.
You're right.
So that's what we're going to play.
That's all right.
We have to figure out what we're doing from there.
Okay.

I hope to have it, I hope to have it, I hope to have it, I hope to have it, I hope to have it, I hope and hope to have it, I hope to have it, I hope to have it, I hope to have it, of it, before we get going...
Because you said the game is about choice. I was going to do subtle choices like listening to conversation or not.
That is a good subtle choice actually.
Because if the player waits they can loan but if they just jump in they just get back in and it's not something major but it kind of just shows how they can manipulate conversation from the beginning.
Just like how all the woods did what you can have that maybe take over but they didn't make that option literally unknown.
That's the 5th of the time.
You might be wondering what I'm referring to is the save course.
I mean this is this sort of commission for it so that I need to convey this.
Well how can you do a physical mockup and then just make...
Well no words don't do it. Words don't express enough.
I mean have them draw the symbol for you.
Oh I got it. Like that.
And then have them make you a template so that you can just draw inside of it.
That's true.
Kind of like there's only one ETC for different quotas.
I need frontouts.
Yeah.
And then you just turn off the letter here.


# REC021.txt
so get printouts of these symbols
like lots
or a page of for it


# REC022.txt
yourself get stencil, or make stencil using cardboard for the symbols for the, uh, effects.
Huh?
Uh, the so called caro, it's, uh, you heard it because you can shoot on it, let's see, make
you have stencils and images.
Okay, I'll talk to you.
I'll talk to you.
I'll talk to you.
I'll talk to you.
I'll talk to you.
I'll be right.
You play how to print out.
I have a pretty monol.
Oh, it's a little token.
It's a metal token.
I can make that magnet on them.
Or better yet, I could have them attached to text or, um, also if you do just the empty stencil.
I can make the magnet, I can make the, I can make the magnets get a magnet board.
Yeah, but the stencils are also, then we can draw them into something else and move it
that piece.
We just need that one physical copy.
Okay, yeah, that works.


# REC023.txt
I'm gonna, so real quick, just grab the scene, we have a desire for curiosity, and this is who?
This is, and then you have, and this scene, you have someone else, someone else's reaction,
so what's the immediate reaction that is?
You can have some attendance.
You have Kalissa and Cardin.
So the interaction with the panel and the characters level will be invested in the event?
Kalissa sees first, and then Cardin reacts.
So, how invested is Kalissa and do this?
She's curious. She's excited.
Okay, so...
Or no, no, actually neither of them see the player has to interest themselves to them.
Okay, so then what would the, so the interaction with each other would be a mix of curious and what?
Curious and...
Relation.
It's a relation with either...
Yeah.
And then, most of what she's saying, she is a...
Spots the Dodec.
Spots the Sprout. Spots the player.
Okay.
Recognizers the player.
Her, no.
She's, becomes, is, if...
She becomes aware.
If aware.
If aware, then...
And when she, what does she feel?
Then...
Oh, look.
I'm surprised.
No, no, no. If, if, if, if then aware, what does she say?
I should say.
What's up?
This is, this is, this describes the entire thing.
Yeah.
If aware, then what's the interaction?
What does she say?
What does she mean?
Well, you're just surprised to rather be a simple escalation to you.
Oh, look, you're weak.
Hey, you're weak.
Yeah.
Oh, hey, you're weak.
You could be as simple as, oh, just, hey, where you would look.
Oh, hey, there, I'm weak.
Oh, hey, there, I'm weak.
Yeah.
And I'll use purple for that.
Because that's character.
That's...
Kalissa.
Yeah.
Then Kalissa.
Kalissa should be...
In...
Oh, we are dark.
Oh.
We are dark.
We are dark.
We are dark.
Just...
If aware.
Might have sight.
Then...
Character and Tract.
Hey, there.
Oh, hey, you're weak.
So we have...
Oh, we didn't actually...
That's...
Yeah, what?
So she's leading the action to the action.
Oh, hey, you're weak.
Yeah, what?
So she's leading the action to the action.
Yeah, what?
So she's leading the action to the action.
Yeah, what?
So she's leading the action to the action.
Yeah, what?
She is.
Just one more time.
Just say that.
Make it very obvious to myself.
This is...
The method I use.
This is...
This is...
If any...
If any...
This is...
This is...
This is...
This is...
This is...
This is...
This is...
This is...
This is...
Come on, no, it's hard to be come on.
Let's meet her.
So the whole force actually pull this way, the whole point of the effect.
So what is she doing, and the one that comes up to me, she's talking to the other guy?
So what is she doing when the dough didn't approach us, you said she's talking to the other guy?
Yeah, they're talking to them.
So what was one of the conversations of the person, can you hear the story of the conversation?
He can, does he wait up like the story of the conversation?
He wakes up in the middle, they wake up in the middle.
What are they talking about then?
They're talking a little bit about art.
So I'd have artists read a philosopher, read me a scientist, and depending on, read an artist
that is interested about the world, and a scientist that is interested in human violence,
is that who they were, or was that what you thought it was about?
There was those two people, those they're background knowledge.
So how are those interacting, how are the, that's one of the answers, so, philosopher, scientist.
So in our every conversation they have, what's going to be about the philosophy?
No, not necessarily, but like Dirt Tash, this is the background, this is, I know,
but you can talk about it in a casual way, or you can have socialization experience.
Yeah, but not every one of those socializations in the year-round, it's how it is.
So this is one thing I need to find, so there's art, science, philosophy, and then there's
another one that I'd like to posit, and that is socialization, or socialize,
right, socialize, socialize, and not on sociology, that's the science I'm talking about,
the art of socialization, the, not the art, the, the human form of human expression,
if art, philosophy, and science are forms of human expression, socialization is just important,
and that is the form of art I'm trying to convey, using these symbols.


# REC024.txt
It's called an affect, and there are 12 affects on the dodeck.
Okay, but an affect isn't pulsing out of each other.
An affect is a result of a person I train. It's an affect of...
Okay, but that's not something that you'd be talking about right now.
No, no, no, no, no.
To figure out what someone is really talking about, you need to understand their context,
understand their intent.
Understand them well, you need to know their motivation, their behavior, their expression.
That's what the symbols are for.
Because we've used...
Okay.
It that?
So what are they talking about?
If aware.
No one's not talking about it, so we can know what symbols to use.
These are four.
That's what the symbols that...
No, no, we're trying to figure out what they're talking about to know what symbols to use.
No, we're not talking about what they're talking about.
Yes, but what are they talking about?
No, this creates this.
This implies this, this curiosity.
Oh, I'm curious, and I'm...
I'm not talking about the emotion, I'm talking about the topic that they're talking about.
Okay, the topic they're talking about, so let's see...
They're talking about...
Do you see curiosity?
They're talking about what they're talking about.
Okay.
I'm talking about...
What is he hearing after?
What is the conversation that is taking place?
What could have been that conversation?
What's the time of the ethics?
I mean, can it be...
We're going for an after-term conversation.
No, we need conversation that's relevant to the theme relevant to the area.
So give me something.
Throw me a bell here.
Throw me an idea.
Okay.
So you said there's another guy in the back.
And you said that the well of the seed is going to wake up.
So all they're waiting for the seed to wake up.
All they're waiting for more friends.
They have different intense.
Because you also mentioned one has a crush on the...
And you knew a shake.
So he is more...
I'm trying to figure out the intent of being in the room.
Well, they're doing therapy, but they don't think that this seed is going to erupt at any moment.
They're not sure.
They're anticipating it, but it's been months now.
No, I don't mean like...
They don't wait until they don't...
They don't switch between anticipation and expectation.
So expectation is you know it's going to happen.
It's going to happen immediately.
Okay, it's mundane expectation.
They know it's going to happen, but they don't go away.
Yeah.
So they know they're going for therapy or for their friend.
Yeah, they're on therapy or...
Well, because I'm trying to figure out the intent.
So all they patient, so it was just him.
They know it's all of them.
They're all patients, but then Marion is not a patient.
Okay, so they're all there to talk to this lady then.
Yeah.
Okay, so then that gives us a reason why they're there.
They're all there for the same reason.
So then you don't have to necessarily shake that.
I wouldn't maybe talk about reasons to be there,
although maybe talking about the previous visit.
Because if their friends are willing to share it,
but they're not going to share it every single detail.
Okay, so...
So if you want their establish,
if she's someone that they go to the council,
you could say, hey, they're really hoping I don't ask.
I'm hoping I can get the same result.
And they've had the other folks who go, me too,
maybe she'll help us again.
When you go deeper in conversation than that, though,
it needs to be a more...
Nobody needs to talk to me to walk on that.
Okay, let's talk about the topic.
Let's go deeper than topic.
So what are they talking about?
They're talking about interacting with each other.
They're talking about using therapy as a means of therapy.
Yeah, they're talking about the use of therapy on their bodies.
So the philosopher is talking about the non-truth,
not like philon philosophy,
but the casual philosopher is talking about...
This is healthy means which take care of yourself.
It's a good thing to do.
That's a social...
I'm not a philosopher, a sociologist.
So a sociolite.
If it makes sense.
You are an artist.
You are a scientist.
You are a philosopher.
You are a sociolite.
If that's too bad.
I don't know what you mean, but no.
It's just...
Give me another word.
I'm trying to figure out a natural conversation
because the way we're trying to get rid of this conversation
is the time to hold a deep conversation.
You're trying to get back on the characters.
And I'm using these four...
I don't have to throw everything out at once.
You can start off slowly
because we're going to have more time to explain.
So you need to start off immediately
that's the scientist.
You can start off at a slow pace.
You can just have it be a Monday topic.
Because you want to give the player a reason to dig.
So if you start off immediately,
what everyone's worrying on,
they'll see what they are.
The player has no reason to dig.
Okay, so the player does not know what they're...
but we know what they are.
We know them.
We don't express this in the end.
We have us to background in our minds.
These are who they are.
So let's make characters.
So this is what we're doing.
Let's make characters to traits.
So Ryan, she is an engineer.
Okay, so what are you talking about?
I know we're not.
But I need to...
I'm listening to them all.
Like...
Engineer...
Carden is...
Let's just focus on what we need right now.
Let's probably get lost.
Well, I can...
Carden is attracted to...
Ryan.
The moment is...
A player should be there too.
Player.
Not enough.
That should be there.
So right now,
who should focus on...
is the chick,
and the person that she saw directly.
Because we need to figure them out
so we can figure out the conversation.
Okay, so there's Kalissa.
Carden.
It's a Mario.
I didn't know no traits there.
All right, so Carden, he is...
Kalissa, she is...
the scientist.
Carden is the...
lost father,
because he's super excited.
Or should we let him be around?
It's okay with this.
Hmm.
I want Carden to be like...
We'll close this more later back.
She's more...
introspective.
And Carden is more...
Carden is more...
How does that work?
How does that work?
How does that work?
How does that work?
How does that work?
Because then that peaks the players interest,
but it also gives you a chance to talk about the walls.
Like, we don't need to pick this specific project.
We use those projects.
Because then they get talking...
it's an event that's still relevant,
but it's not tied to one build.
So then we can bounce around.
She can talk about more of how she's excited about some of the new...
construction materials they've developed.
And he can talk about maybe more of what he plans
that they hope to do for the space.
Because if you send ones socially based,
and that means they'll probably be more interested in maybe...
what's going to go in that space?
What are they going to build?
Is it going to build community areas?
Is it going to be housing?
And maybe the scientists want to be more interested in...
the tourism they're going to be using,
or it's very easy to do what they're researching
to help with building the new expansion.
Because then you get...
how coated you have about both,
but also you cover the wall.
Because you get, I realize,
you're not going to have a lot of room for dialogue.
You're typically going to want to keep your conversation short
because you don't want to play it to get too...
disinterested.
Yeah.
So a little...
maybe if they'd oxygen-free?
What's up?
If they'd oxygen-free or not in the woods?
I've seen oxygen-free, yeah.
Oxen-free.
What?
Oxen-free.
What about neither woods?
What is it?
Night in the woods?
No.
One about...
what's the one?
Firewatch.
Yeah, we normally talk about firewatch the full time today.
Okay.
Yeah, that's all three different stories.
But I'm thinking more in terms of dialogue from Oxen-free
or...
or, in other woods.
In other woods to describe it,
they have these...
I'm sure that a burst of conversation.
They're not long-winded discussions.
They're more naturalistic back and forth.
It's a conversation of friends.
What are some times to keep it that way?
Yeah, so it's like,
what are they saying?
Oh, hey, they're awake.
What's next?
This is natural.
They just go through it.
Well, so we haven't figured out...
so what are they talking about?
Because they're not going to know as the player instantly.
We were just at the point of figuring out the conversation.
We said that they were talking about the construction connection.
So this is...
this is technically how it's towards them.
This is after that.
So who's speaking?
Police or the other one?
Can let's say speaking.
I mean, she's talking about...
is he the science one or the social one?
Oh, right now.
Cardin says this.
Yeah.
Okay, is he the science one or the social one?
Social one.
So he would probably begin the conversation with...
what do you think they're going to put
while we're expanding?
And then you would have to either...
add on to that or begin her own point,
or she would be...
I don't know, but...
and then she would either tie into the scientific processes
that they're using to build materials
or what she hopes to be put there,
keeping up the conversation.
So you have to decide if she follows the flow
or goes against the flow.
Because if she goes if the flow,
then the poor fire will probably be...
something along your lines...
what she hopes this faces
and when she's moving the whole topic.
But if she goes against the flow,
then she will just immediately state the whole topic.
Good point.
Okay, so is she...
anxious about her or is she aggressive about it?
I think she's...
She's excited.
She's just about it.
No, she's curious.
She's curious.
And maybe pleasure.
Because you're excited, you're happy about it.
You're thrilled.
Pleasure and...
no, pleasure, relation and desire.
All three.
It's very complex.
No, we get through right to this down.
Oh, I haven't...
No, here, but...
Yeah.
Oh, they can last again, actually.
It's easier if the visual is normal.
So, I'm going to...
So, pleasure.
Relation.
And desire.
And then it would be...
Is she...
On start.
Is she following the topic or is she going against it?
She is...
happy about it.
Is she following the topic or is she going against it?
Oh, I see what you mean there.
I guess she...
No, she's following...
She's started the topic.
This is her topic.
She wants to talk about it.
Okay, but...
No, so...
Why wait?
You should be...
No, you're right.
Carden started it.
And she's talking about now.
She's following the topic.
So, is she going to follow the random conversation?
And guess which...
Or say that she wants in the space?
Or is she going to change the direction of the conversation?
I have a...
I want her to be optimistic.
No, I'm not saying she's against the topic.
I'm trying to...
Trying to use what you're saying here.
She comes out of it optimistic.
She's taking the topic and she's...
Making it...
She's...
Oh, but he's...
There's no...
Connotation, though, what he's saying.
All he's asking is,
What do you think they're going to put into space?
Why are you putting something negative?
Is there a negative?
I thought we were...
I thought we were...
I thought they were talking about the city construction
as they're building the walls.
Yeah, he's...
He asked what these things are going to put there.
Oh...
Do you think we'll get some more...
Okay.
So, what is...
What is...


# REC025.txt
Do you think we'd get more
Research facilities this time around
Do you think we'll a commission for do you think we'll what do you what do you call it?
I'd be do you think we'll sponsor no, it's like a oh, yeah, but
It's not that zoning zoning is controlling the government. It's not like a collective agreement to both here
It's a it's a
Zoning is
Zoning is not a thing in this kind of society. There's no cards. So people built people people people people spend people
People expend people have the resource to build larger, but they need to work together to expand
Which is why they have
Okay, imagine this imagine this imagine city being built out worth and as things are built people would come together to build them
They build a platform and then they built
Huh, you going to have a deal?
Yeah, they will they're
People will get built wherever they want to if they want to build right next to their office. They can
Why don't you have rules for that? It's just
Imagine rules about efficiency. It's not about efficiency. It's about socialization
It's in that lab
You really want that lab being next to the house. It's not the okay. I think you mean there those more rigorous facilities need to be
Higher up
We know but but the casual facilities the ones that are not of science that that is potentially catastrophic is
Is
Or more technical needs more space. You know, I feel like I was I'm not you're getting that in the details again
We're walking on more reply. She said she wants resource facilities
Correct. Yeah, so then what is this is a pie to that?
Hmm
He's sold it away
The expansion projects and he hopes he asked so what does she think?
It's been a bit of support for the research facilities because he has a positive group by the way
I hope okay. Yes. Oh, nice for any more knowledge. No, I don't really think that this is a little better than that
What are you guys what field are you guys in?
What field where fields are came in and what field field field is your group? I'm a field is your your your
So he's interested in the topic your comrades. You're what do you call them?
You're your resource
No, no, you're you're your positive your group. You're your family. You're who what?
Well team team your team. Yeah, that's always a photo as a team
But it's not like your
Co-workers, no, not co-workers. No, so the collaborators. It is collaborators teams
collaborators or teams
Team collaborators. What do you call that?
Little they they discuss. No, you you want this team, but there's also they didn't really express
They're also funding together to do this
They already do that as a team as a resource team to leave each person brings their expertise in the research money. Oh
Okay, yeah, that works
They just use team because they're not focused on titles that focus something and result together
Okay, on start
What do they say they say?
What's the role of the title of the organization is he's talking about the expansion garlics
So response is she wants resource facilities his response is
What is your team studying?
And then now we have to figure out the shoe respond or does she change topics?
Machine is not pushing its science
Is no it's
Technology
Because the flexion is in the same bad thing. It could be maybe she's isn't what's on the whole thing
Hey, she's been doing it for
All day and she doesn't even break them in
So does she stick the topic that she deflect?
How is your team expanding?
It's not a one horse horse response. Oh, I'm his question was what is she
Resulting and then who response little on there she answers this is what
She answers openly
We're looking into I mean it's it's it's almost done. We we started a week ago
I mean, I mean it's another another few days of their construction, but it's almost finished
For the time of the research for the building of the structure
You need to convey that's outward building
No, no, so
She's starting her own facility. I know, but okay, so you just
Yeah, you gotta change his reply then, okay, because you're his reply is what is your team researching and the whole
Responses what two days done, okay, so we're building so we got a chance to respond
Okay, let's change his response. What did you say?
Honestly, why?
Okay, I'll say on start what is that's what he says, okay, so is he is talking to all about
The expansion and he asks
I mean he stays
What are they going to build or what do you think they're going to build is what he asks so
If what did you want to try to do that?
So what is your question to be currently you asked two questions one question was okay, so what would you for the thing to ask?
How did you get to the question? How do you get that?
Our team
No, so what is the opening statement he gave he gave that they're expanding the facilities
Underwork backwards here. Yeah, they're expanding the facilities. They're uh, and he talks about the instruction and he hopes that they build what social spaces
No, he doesn't he's he's social
I'd be socializing. He's a show. He's a socializing. Yeah, but what does he hope is be built does he ask so
He's more curious. I think okay. I'm trying to I know I don't need his traits. I need you to give me what he's asking curious and
Uh, wanting
No, that's the same thing actually
Yeah, um, okay, so
We have established she stated that the facility is being expanded
He asked so what does she hope is being built what is her response
her
responses
Oh, we're building a facility we're building a facility for um by engineering
not by engineering let's say uh
Oh, we're building a yeah, yeah, by engineering. We're building a by engineering. We're we're almost the facilities almost done
The biorenger or uh, we're not doing anything yet, but um our biorenger
By our engineering facility, we'll be up in a few days
Okay, so then what do we go from there?
Um
Pardon says maybe
There's no going to have to build this conversation like five times
Because now we know that this is joining the only one is this once. Oh, so there's no branching. There is branching
But it's it's it's very it's spaced out
A little more than I think no much for this conversation
No, because you can't interact you can't do anything yet
Okay, so these are conversations with me over there
But it's it's it's instigated by the player's interaction
So the direction it takes can be changed a little bit
So I mentioned like you're
You talk to close the first you talk to your first and then card jumps in you talk to cool. It's hard to card
And then it jumps in there's subtle variation of this conversation is happening before they realize the AI's up
So you have to forget him for now. Okay, let's focus on what they're talking about. I need you to come up before response
No, here's the response she has an out-to-intent that
They're building an environment you're knowing lab and it's finished in two days. So what is it response of that?
Oh, yeah, no, it's um
Yeah, I'm excited. It's gonna be cool
Yeah, I'm excited. It's gonna be fun. Yeah, I'm excited. It's gonna. Yeah, we're really excited for him because season's not a sign to season so for that
Yeah, we're really excited you should come visit
No, we're on his response
Yeah, we got to fight his response. You got to make it a little more because you asked
Yeah
So why is she inviting him on his response? Oh, damn it. Okay. So he responds
Again, nobody say
Damn it dude. It's so hard
I think we're focusing to about to that that was great
That was the dialogue is
No, so right now we'll try to figure out what the AI is over here and before he approaches
Some of them are having a conversation. This is that's really difficult because you have to as far as out of conversation. It's unnatural
Because it yet that we're we can't drop never think we have to actually you start somewhere
Well, no, so what I'm trying to do is build a conversation because once we get a conversation going
We can find a cutoff point in the middle with this is how you start this hard part of your story
In the first flow of that information
Well, yeah, so what I'm trying to do is we want him to come into the middle
So if we figure out what he's talking about we can then expand the actual dialogue
This isn't the actual dialogue. We're just building bullet points to expand from okay, because you said he's gonna come into the middle
So can you can you just so let's get this expanded and then we'll figure out a cutoff point in the middle
So that was hold up for the AI to figure it was happening. All right, let me try this for that. I'm gonna do
Let's go back to getting let's grab to cardinette the question. Okay, so causes question was
Did you hear about the expansion projects? What do you think they're going to build?
You
You don't want these pants up for us. We're gonna burn these sticky nuts. What's it? They're lots
Okay, this is up for me
Um, what did we said her response was because this isn't going to be the extra dialogue
You're gonna have to walk with your voice actors and figure out that. Yeah
This is one of the script dialects both of us so we did
We described situation they can turn it to better dialogue later on. Yeah, this is just so that they have something to walk off
Did you hear about the expansion projects?
Yeah, they're they're interesting
Uh, no. Yeah, my team's working one of them. Well, so it wouldn't be working on it if she's a scientist
She would say
Yeah, my team is getting one of the facility's
No, we'd be given because they're not paying for so we'll be given one of the new facilities
No, no, yeah, we collaborated on the new facility
You know, it's like well because we know they'd work together on this. This is their team. Yeah, my team collaborated on one of the new facilities
Well, have we have we're expressing excitement because
She's getting a brand-new testing facility which for a scientist is like a golden egg
Yeah, my team kind of what my my team's uh because you gotta realize if this is a new expansion
That means if you who research is priority so I mean she's excited because
Okay, I got she's being chosen out of this 20 billion population to get lab
Okay, so if she would be pretty excited that relation. Yeah, she'd be pretty elated
And she'd probably be gushing about a walk because and desire because she wants to she she she wants no more. She's curious. She
desires curiosity
Please fees there, right?
Today is
Tuesday. Yes, I have Wednesdays Thursday and I believe Friday off. Okay, and then what else pleasure?
You think oh
Yeah, definitely I
Well, we gotta remember there's actually a few more here. I want to list
Um, they're not in the dough that I can't
But I conveyed it's my artist. He's gonna do it since it before to pay him
um
enmity
distrust empathy trust shame embarrassment prime confidence
So the interesting ones there would be pride and shame and then trust distruster and empathy enmity
As better describers. We can't forget about that. Would you see empathetic grand pathetic against
Usually right now. She's starting. She's yeah, it's not
Yeah, I know you want to use the other ones really. Oh, it's a shame embarrassment. I don't think these ones are relevant yet
um
Pride confidence
So what do you have already
For to we have
Uh
And it's not I don't have memorized yet
We have
little not pleasure. We have elation
indesire and then we have
either one um
pride
So then what does she say
For case Peter pride um
We want to stick with yeah, what my team was given one of the facilities. Yeah, my team was given one of the facilities
Okay, so then let's stick with that
So then his response was the question. Oh, what filter you guys in
You
No, it has to be more forcing than every it probably would be something close to like
Congratulations, oh really and then it would be followed by what is your team
researching
Okay, did you hear within the project spent did you hear about the new uh expansion projects? Yeah, my team's working one of them
What a whole team was given a laugh
And my team collaborated to build a lab
Yeah, my team collaborative. I don't know
Yeah, my team got one cold
No, I would just you pick
I'm just trying to
So we're trying to bring it to what she's describing called fill great. Yeah
So
If
If she's talking about the expansion projects will team wouldn't be the focus of the conversation would be the project itself
So it would probably be along the lines of we were given a lab my team was given a lab or I was given a lab
And then after he asked about the wolf as one should probably
So
That'll be the name forever heard the person talking
Representative my text. Representative my colleague
Um, and then
She says
Did you hear about the new expansion did you hear about the expansion?
Has your team expanded yet?
He does know about how close is your cuz he's your close member and how close your team to be finished
Okay, so
His question is flawed then from the beginning. Yeah, it is so I need to go back
So he knows he's curious. He's more uh
Well, so
She might not know that she has a lab yet. No, no, they're close friends. Yeah, but it doesn't mean they're talked about it like she wants to
She's in some regard. They're fine. She might collaborate on the lab, but she might not know. She was being given a lab yet
No, no, they worked together to build it
I know, but she might not have not known. She's receiving the lab
She might have just thought she was walking on the lab
Why would you not have an expectation if it's built up machines and they have an expectation of one if you don't
Collaborate so collaborativeism resources wise. No, I know, but that's what I mean. She's realizing she owns the lab as an after
She might think this is a project. She's being assigned to welcome. No, it's not an assignment. It's her her her and her team want to build this
Her and her team are building this. There's no government involved. It's just them
Okay, but then that thought makes that question pause. Then we have to fix that question. No, no, it's fine as is
It's just my team and I are almost done. It's through a few days away. No, so he's asking so the way that I question his phrase is
He doesn't know what they're building
Sometimes we have to rebuild it because the question is
Do you know what they're doing with the expansion projects? But if she knows he's building if he knows she's building a lab
He wouldn't ask that he would ask how far along this will allow
Okay, yeah, that's that's that then
So let's see that's
So would that be that'd be desire to know you're very curious
And then you have
We'll get ones and many empathy and then
So what we're talking about the lab
We're talking about the symbol and then yeah, but they're expressing his
Relations of the lab was what we're trying to discuss
Yeah, I know
I just hold that thought hold that dialogue bit. I'm trying to articulate using this
No, I know, but we're trying to use that to figure out emotions
So if it's his friend, yeah, it's the first emotion you have written down
It's desire
Okay, so it's curiosity. It's curiosity or desire. It's both
Erosion desire one of the same they are want there. It's also curiosity. It's it's okay. There's a whole torsum too
I need to know what the symbol you're in now. The symbol is what it is right there. This one. Yes, this one the second one
This one is a footnote of desire. Okay, so we have a desire already
Sometimes we need to be able
pieces of that
What is what he'd be feeling though in that whole lab is being built?
Um
Is he asking how far the lab is?
We can't make the empathy trust this trust
And then there's another one there was so trust wouldn't be enrolled. Yeah, all right. They wouldn't be enrolled
So then you have to the one
What is it?
Brain come out here
Just would help me out here
Shameless and bride confidence
I don't know this fit. So let's just say it's extreme curiosity
That's why you need to say really. Okay
You only say more than that
And that he would be
Well, let's just do that
Take some of those
You
Charton
Closer
All right
You so who's leading in the conversation very cardinous the question
Moving
So cardinous question. Yes, so how's your facility going along?
Okay, so then let's write that down. That's a good response
You
How is your facility coming along and then she says
Um
Oh, we're just a few days away from finishing. Oh, oh, it's only a few days away
It's uh
All right, we'll be done in about a week you want to come visit
You want to check it out? So let's add that down
We'll be done in a week
So but is she inviting him right now. Yeah, she is she's expressing it's almost done. She wants to show him what he's done
So she's inviting him though. Yeah, okay, because we need to lead over responses that there
All right, you want to come visit it'll be over every it'll be done in a week
Like that. Yeah, so
Uh, it'll be it'll be done in a week. You want to come over then
That'll be maybe done a few days when I come over. It's done
It'll be done over. It'll be allowed to show it. Yes. It's open space
Well, there's still be some kind of securities
Hmm
Typically in a distrustful society we don't lock her doors
Uh, in a distrustful side we do lock her doors. I bet
In a distrustful side we do lock her doors in our in a trustful side of your lock her doors
We do lock her doors
Okay, well, it isn't about trust. It's just if you have labs
It's an overall trust. There's maybe some minimal security. Well, it's more just safety security
You need a layer of safety because you're gonna have chemicals and materials that are very corrosive and dangerous
Okay, so we're gonna have like either doors or obstacles or gold or some kind. So I imagine there are doors
Then there are the locks on important things in the house
Like on things that we potentially hazardous I should say so the lab if it's a lab that does allow visitors
Is it would probably allow visits into the lobby
Some of the labs and it would only be like the extremely sensitive testing equipment
Wouldn't have visitors. Okay, yeah
Because I wouldn't have someone around a mass spectrometer. That is not to do it
Because that is at a hundred thousand dollars piece of equipment and if they fuck us it they break it
Well, you might bring them into the basic lab. Well, you guys take the samples and do the testing because
It's just okay laboratory sinks and cabinets to what degree in the social space is the player allowed
It is his his card with permission
Probably everywhere but the area of the expensive stuff
Okay, so typically the only place in the lab that are locked or biological samples
Because it's HIPPA
Any corrosive agents so typically acids and solutions like that and then
Typically expensive equipment and expensive medicine samples
The rest of the lab is typically free roam
Because they know scientists are going to come in and out anytime
They only typically lock up the dangerous stuff the infectious stuff and the expensive stuff
So pretty much if she's allowed to have a visit then he would probably have free roam of the lab
Except for some of the most secure areas
She would probably wouldn't want to bring them in because so it's an expensive fix so she'd be like
Do you want to take a tour of the lab or do you want to take a tour? Well, it'll be done a week
That'd be a good way to slice it
You want to do you want to go on a tour or do you want to
Do you want to go on a tour?
Because more safety stuff than labs isn't about the theft
You know what they just don't want to stupid people to kill themselves
You would have had your flow of acid
Have you seen what it does to people? Yeah, it fucks them up if you know that if you don't know your force
Expose you don't realize it. Oh, that's fucked. It's a slow bone so you could get it on you
And then it will be an hour or two later where you get the results
That's what makes hydrofolics such as it's not the fact that it's an acid is
It's not one that is a normal acid or you fill the effects immediately
You can there are stories of people touching it going the bed waking up of these giant wounds
That's not that you're that that's tough like a slits. It's corrosive and it fucks you up all the time
It told us the fat cells instead of the actual flesh
And so it eats away within the flat cushion in between the flesh and the skin
And then it still is eating the skin because the skin is made of fat cells and then it strips down with the red flesh on the bone
Typically people will get it on their hands and then they'll touch their face
So they'll get it on their body and spread it around because like they touch the spot and they rub it around
Geez
Yes, so that's assuming that it's hydrofolics that the other isn't glad it's super strong
It's just super corrosive over time unless you wash it off
Well, that's the thing is you can't wash off because it absorbs easily into the fat of this game
Jesus
That's terrifying
Like when these people handle it you're talking like the spot as big as that can be lethal in the human body
Because it just eats straight to the red tissue


# REC026.txt
Imagine that you're exploring this area, this world, right?
And you want to go out and navigate the cold.
There is some danger in that.
People have lost, no one's died.
Yeah, but people have lost fingers.
They've lost limbs.
They've got corrosion and noses.
They're face.
So it was one of the issues of that.
Those that have to be extreme outweighs,
because the city is able to produce its own life,
giving heat to have enough to build a golden in this climate.
We're going to have pretty damn good protection.
That's true.
You know, that's me.
You're right.
Especially if it's that symphs that you built with an irregularity.
Exactly.
So you would have this be like extreme anomalies.
It would be injuries.
You're right.
So that's kind of the issue of who you're talking to.
Because you painted yourself in the narrative corner
of some pits, because you removed injuries.
It has to be now accidents.
There's no play.
And that's fine.
That's fine.
You're right.
I should remove that.
That's going to be a thing.
If you want to keep out the mystic,
you want to keep it in the threat of the theme.
So it wasn't like what I was saying.
The mystic's just the advanced stuff.
Well, this is like petty shit to them at real estate.
In an orthic dungeon, but they have goadins in this town.
It's cool what I got in here at the end, you're right.
Anyway, so try to avoid trebs, try to avoid trebs.
So no frostbite.
It's really cold, but technology's
sufficient to keep them warm without any injuries.
With the advanced past, the point of injury is pretty much.
Yeah, it's not really.
People live for thousands of years.
It's accidents, you know.
And the attention on what is that?
One piece of technology I want to kind of give you
is kind of infer to you.
Seeing how there's large structures.
I have these towers, these buildings.
What if there's these little drones?
Not drones, but like they're like 60 devices.
Not drones, they're more of them.
They're safety nets.
They're safety balloons.
Oh, so they're looking around for movement.
And if there's a ride movement, I'm like flailing
or something standing, and then if something's falling,
it's going to be fast.
Fast movement, it shoots in a balloon and it can catch them.
But here's the thing.
So some of the passive defense systems.
Yeah.
So it's for safety measures, but there's not extreme.
So like you're climbing a tree, there's.
It's not going to be people who get injured,
but you have technology to fix those minor injuries.
No, I mean, I mean, there's a people that fall off the pillow.
Because that's the extreme, or the pillar itself,
or the larger structures that could kill them if they fall.
So they have a passive safety system.
Yeah, it's automated safety.
Yep.
Well, that's what you call a passive, because it's not a thing
that has to be controlled.
Yeah, it's not a constant observing people.
It's just observing movement.
It's like, just checking it on an X.
Anyway.


# REC027.txt
that it has moved beyond the conventional phase of injuries, injuries, or either going
lead to short accidents, health problems, mishaps, or just the other case, no, dose of
bad luck.
Yeah.
Ooh, that's going to make you know to hold.
Well, it's more interpersonal conflict, it's not like the sci-fi setting in themselves.
Sci-fi setting is a means of curiosity.
People are intrigued.
No, I'm intrigued.
Players are intrigued.
But it's built around characters, for example, I mean, out awards.
I mean, one of the areas, there's a dialogue thing with the guys, I'm like, yeah, I'm
walking in space, because my jewelry's too fast, we all die.
That one's like, wait, what?
He's like, yeah, don't worry, I used to hang out with him for granted, but no, I don't
anymore.
It just brings up, because it just reminds you, like, hey, yeah, that's right.
You could die in a second, these are like colonies.
Yeah, but I'm going to call the opposite direction of that.
No, I know, but I just thought that was one of those.
That's where we went from.
It was you were talking like, oh, frostbite, it's like, well, wait, we have the technology
to grow stuff here.
Yeah, it's a big deal.
Yeah, you can grow, you can imagine like having some of this, I think it was you, actually.
You mentioned that if someone lost a limb or whatever, you could have these temporary limbs
that you hold onto until you have to choose to have your own costume, so I'm nice, you
can have, like, placement, placement over 7 and X.
He was a little camel of the feet in his face, and he tried to look like an X.
We started talking about 7 and X, and that's the time when I've been being in a candy
one, because I've worn out this, like, a place hole.
Yeah?
That's just a good way of putting it.
So here's a question about them, and so obviously, injuries don't scare you to them.
So for the sake of narration, since they don't have to worry pretty much about death,
it's kind of like an outlier for them, they don't really have to worry about injury,
what we're going to need to move to an area of them is not action-situentious, but
all of them are making the player make a choice.
So I'm going to try a CDN to keep walking, getting distracted, my man, I'm just frustrated
by keeping doing this, because it's important to the overall narrative.


# REC028.txt
There's a lot of different different trends out here.
So imagine you start a supplier.
You're from the first person perspective.
You're navigating a room.
You see yourself in the mirror.
You don't have hands.
You come back to the door.
You're whatever interactions.
And you interact with Mario.
Mario gives you hands.
Then she gives you hands.
And then she goes away for a bit.
I know you have hands.
You have sort of hands at first.
You can point left and right to sort of communicate.
So move your hands or whatever.
You can communicate archery through your hands.
Yeah.
But then you have...
You're given the ability to move around using your feet.
And then Mario arrives.
And then you're kind of navigating a space further.
This is where we want to design further from.
This is the point at which we need to describe more.
But I think if you jump from that to the next section.
I don't see any other things in the conversation.
Because we're in the middle of a conversation.
I know.
But I want to explain the theme I want to convey.
Overall theme.
The overarching theme.
I know.
But right now that theme wouldn't affect you.
I know.
But this is something I want to explain to me myself later on.
I can go back to it.
It's a tangent from the time.
Because if you write the dialogue is one point.
But I need to flesh us out.
So from that secondary point, after you've gone through
Mario's interactions and the interactions in that first area.
You in a dark source kind of way.
Now like you unlock a new section of the world.
This pillar area is on that construction.
You go through.
After it's done.
This is how we'll add new content.
But it's also how we'll...
Because you expand the world way.
But at the same time, you give the player a temporary barrier until they've gone through a barrier
which they didn't have late.
Well, it's like a metroidvania, right?
You get late.
And then what do you get next?
You get actual hands, maybe.
Maybe you get a body.
Maybe you get...
Maybe it's Mario's going to get...
Give me a body.
Yeah, but first we're going to get...
This is temporary.
Hmm?
Okay, but first we have to get to the point where the AI is interacting.
Because all we have so far is two pieces of a conversation.
Between man and...
Because it's...
Okay.
Well, I think there's enough.
I won't move on.
So...


# REC029.txt
We all are right now and start our own ways.
The player needs to lock the top a little bit.
We have an introduce to player yet.
So let's finish the conversation they get the player to do.
Because once we get the player to do,
then we can finish up the dialogue with Marion
and then still flesh it off the outside.
Because I know we have mainly honestly about
five minutes of the game.
So let's work on another one.
Let's do the five minutes before we build the rest of the world.
Fair point.
Let's give this to a 10 minute point.
And then we can worry about the rest of the world.
15 minute demo.
The vertical slice.
Almost.
Yeah.
As I imagine, it's the first.
It's the only just the initial level.
Yeah.
We got like maybe like 30 seconds of actual content here.
Maybe not like 15 or 5 if that.
We need more than 5 minutes because you have open and credits.
Probably about a minute of music.
And then a few minutes like about maybe a 30 to a minute of just
your eyes or your lens waking up and watching this.
And that's what we've talked about at least.
Okay.
That's what we've got.
It is, you know, working up and you hold two people,
say at two sentences and then you try to jump into the next one.
I mean, I'm going to try that.
We got to backtrack a little bit.
Let me move forward.
Hey, Carden.
Hey, how's your facility coming along?
So we've already got her response.
She says.
She said it's a week away from going,
do you want to take a tour?
Hey, do you want to take a tour?
It's almost done.
Yeah.
Because we already established,
yes, the facilities have secure support
with the public areas available because the way the society is built.
We trust them.
We're worried about theft because it's a post-scarcity society.
So theft is an issue and that is injury.
It's just more.
They have any matter,
another dangerous shit in there.
So then we need to build his response,
which is probably a yes,
probably positive and probably,
he's already curious about the lab.
So then he would probably ask,
so he would of course say yes because of friends.
And then he would probably ask,
what are you researching?
Or what do you plan to start researching?
It would be about a question.
So probably one of the lines of yesterday of course,
because of friends,
so it wouldn't be much hesitation.
And then the next day would probably be,
what would it be?
What do you guys hope to start working on once the lab is done?
Or does she not have a privilege yet?
Because now on a whole response after this.
So let's finish this question.
His response to the yes.
So those are positive responses.
We'll start with happiness.
Because yes.
Oh, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah, sure, that'd be great.
And then the second half of the question is a question.
And that is a question asking,
what is your team working on?
I hope you're still working on it.
So okay, we need to get rid of it.
So we have curiosity,
elation,
and we've already done desire,
so let's get desire.
Let's just do curiosity and elation for now.
A curiosity, and layman.
Uh.
Curiosity and elation itself.
Yeah, sorry.
Elation.
I'm sorry, I'm drowning it.
Curiosity.
You sure it's right?
Wait, what was that for?
Is this one older?
Elation was that.
But earlier on, it was.
And right to the end of the film, actually.
I'm sure that's right.
Yeah, curiosity and elation.
So desire.
So this is wrong there.
Yes, that's what it was.
So his response.
I don't know anything else.
So like, you know, that was a great response.
Why did you kill it?
Elation is the real little Jason bull.
Oh, fuck.
And the desire is.
Yeah, damn it.
Jason's going to come back to this house, like, like, a madhouse.
Here you will.
It'd be funny.
Well, let's take a moment to pause.
Look at what you have to do.
You have spread out sticky notes.
We have what looks like badly,
but it's fun there, right?
We're doing some, I feel like we're making progress.
We're making progress.
We made it.
It took us only four hours to come up with 10 minutes of gameplay.
And for your 10 hour game,
that ratio we should be done in about a year or two.
No, it's not about timeline, but it's terrible time, right?
What do you mean?
Because it's not going to be that fast.
Because...
Oh, you're right.
I'm going to end soon.
And I'll be back down to Sunday Mondays off.
You are correct.
It's not all right.
I can't get the white curve.
I keep making it a B.
So, maybe let's not get out of the symbol right now.
No, it's important.
Because this isn't getting so much more information than you realize.
Then...
Most people...
I know we're going to have to eventually start using these.
So I'm just trying to get in the habit of using them now.
Instead of getting the chat too.
And we're like, oh, now we have to.
It's a good new thing.
Well, let's just get the symbols down now.
Let's get used to using our reference items.
Because I realized we're going to have to have these about the player's head.
So they were the...
I went with the player that said beat.
The character's head.
So they were the player who knows what the hell is going on.
But damn, there's a little wheelbarrow thinking.
It is, but it's clever.
It's making to pay more information.
No, we can, but...
It's hard when you're used to explaining everything to local ones.
Because then now you've got to stop.
There's a couple of symbols that you know represent it.
And then go to the conversation around those symbols.
Yep.
But you're using the symbols to make things that are randomly expressed by humans.
Not only cheating.
Like, I know why we have to use them.
Is this a weird way of trying it?
I think right now.
I'm just hoping I'm bored.
What's up?
No, my mind just likes to peel.
Hopping.
So I just need a ton of stimulus.
It's kind of perfect then, huh?
I appreciate you saying that when I play with you,
I'm also listening to a show and researching topics on my phone.
Yeah, and you're going to do multiple things.
Because I can't do that.
I get so distracted.
I get a focus, focus, focus.
Okay, I get a lot to go.
I get a lot to go.
My job is all glenial thinking and it's so boring at my job.
Because it's not challenging mentally.
It's only physically challenging.
Yeah, so I feel work too.
So, okay.
So that's why I research new school of vision by Isaac As well.
You should really do some more Isaac Arthur.
He's great.
I know you're listening to him.
Like, he gets me.
So Isaac As well as his father of new school of theory.
Well, I know.
But I mean, there's also Isaac Arthur.
And you can do both.
There's multiple.
I mean.
No, she's not the only one.
He's the most recent one I'm listening to.
I ain't got you.
Okay.
So Ian, what did you say again?
He says, how's your first cut?
How was your facility coming along?
So he expressed...
You're not going to be done soon.
You're not going to be done soon.
He expresses a positive response to her question which was to the tour.
Then he expresses what?
Oh, yeah, that'd be cool.
Or yet?
Well, what did you team walking on with the question?
Yeah, so it was...
He's still positive.
Positive and the curiosity.
It was excitement.
Pleasure.
No.
Elation and curiosity.
Elation and then the curiosity.
He stores his depositivity.
Eliposit response.
But he switches to a question being...
What?
What is he asking?
A whole resource.
That's right.
He's curious about what is the project they're going to be starting.
So his response would be, yeah, what do you guys know?
It's when are you guys starting?
When are you guys starting?
No, it wouldn't be when.
Because you gave the timeline.
The timeline is in two weeks.
It would be what?
It would be...
What are you...
What are you producing?
What are you researching?
What is...
What is the process?
Like, what is she?
She is...
Because we know she's a scientist.
But is she researching?
Is she building?
Or is she testing?
Testing.
Let's say she's part of the group.
Is she part of the science group?
But it's talking to Temuish.
Temuish?
Is that your character?
Yeah.
It's called Dodeck.
That has the body and he talks to people.
Wait, you have name for him?
Huh?
Yeah, we talked about it on Discord a while ago.
Temuish?
It means made of iron.
I don't think I actually...
That's a cool name.
We talked about this a couple weeks ago.
It's in the Discord.
But we would be...
That's because of how I started helping you on this.
Huh.
I was just faced out.
That's crazy.
That's a good name.
Because that's how we came up with the patios.
Temuish.
So...
Kami?
Kami.
Kami.
Kami could be the name...
For who?
For the player.
Kami.
Oh.
So...
Because Temuish is sort of what Temuish is.
Or is that a Mongolian from Man of Iron?
Temuish.
Temu.
Temu.
Oh, you're going to play out about Temuish?
Temu.
To my.
To my?
To my...
To my...
Temuish is an extraction of an actual war.
But I've already made it not a war because I only extracted the part of what I like.
So...
Because technically the net war was Temuish.
Temu.
Hey, Temuish.
And I showed it to Temuish.
Temuish.
So...
Why do we not become a weapon with the patios, man?
Because we make it too close to another character.
So we're going to assume a connection that's not there.
Well, that's why I have all the names of different cards.
So...
Maureen and Wilmet.
Okay.
So...
Do you want any of the players?
Or do you want any of the players of the freedom of the name themselves?
Well, we want the...
We want the...
They don't have a name yet.
So they...
And they can't speak.
So they're just given...
They're given a name.
And the player...
Oh, you know what we could do?
We're going to have Temuish is just the placeholder name of the species
until the assignment name.
Well, I was thinking the species name would be the edict.
No, I mean, not the actual one, but the one that they call it.
Oh.
Like a critical...
It's a...
It's a dimension.
We're not a dimension, but they just call them Temuish when they're small like that.
Temuish.
Okay.
Because...
It is a Temu, a Temu.
Yeah, it gives them something they call the player when the player can introduce themselves.
And it's not...
I had a day gone, it's not dough day.
Okay.
It's a Temuish.
Okay, I like that.


# REC030.txt
Yeah, it sounds almost empathetic. It's like a little, yeah. So the player's name is, or the name is regarded as
Temu. That is the name of the Dodax. They're like, hey, doggo, hey, Temu. But it's more empathetic, it's more human, it's more, it's just a empathetic as it should be.
It's a way to empathize with it since they can't describe a little of the names. It doesn't have a name, so they give it a...
A name of a placeholder. Yeah, a nickname or a placeholder. Until I can express itself and choose a name. That's cool though. Temu.
Temu. Temu. That's why that is wheelies in some...


# REC031.txt
They don't really. The trout doesn't need a name until the first year.
Because until then they believe the guys might claim the child.
Because it's just a hole over from where we found three, so it's so terrible we'd know.
And death rates are so terribly high.
We would have six kids only two would live.
They had infants dying, and so if we were cultural, we don't name the baby before the
four-year-old. It has to own its name.
That's pretty crazy. A lot of cultures won't cut their hair for the
last year for that same reason.
Literally we cut the child's hair with bad luck.
Or invite spirits to it.
Yeah, there's so much weight superstition.
This is for the map.
I don't know if I should ask you for some design.
Crazy.
I can go over here and project it, actually.
I've got enough still. This is the second or the thing to do later.
This is how I'm using now.
Pat that pat.
Don't need a phone right now.
You must either sleep fucking, be free, be focused.
We've been in the long tangent.


# REC032.txt
So he says, yeah, sure.
Have you guys figured out you need a project?
Oh.
Figure it out?
Wait, because she might have...
So she's working with team.
It means that they have to come up with consensus on the topic
that they're gonna research.
And maybe she doesn't know yet,
because we haven't figured out a whole place on the team.
Maybe it's whole lab,
because she's a member of the team.
But it doesn't mean she's a leader.
Well, Marion's the engineer.
She's a equal part of the team.
You don't know.
You're cooking upon it.
I'm talking about for the science side.
Because we're talking about...
Oh.
...cliffs.
We don't know who's placed on the team.
Oh, okay.
So if you want to fix the point,
because you said you wanted to tie to 10-ish,
the order one.
Well, I mean, we could make a team made of the scientists
that we'll be talking about, the broken Dodeck.
Because that would bring all of our narrative points
full-sourced votes then.
Because the player wouldn't know yet,
but all the connections would be the Dodeck.
But the player doesn't realize he's the Dodeck.
He's only seen his hands in the ball.
He gains more symbols over time.
Thank you.
More symbols over time.
No, no, no.
But, so, you've only shown the player his upper torso
with his head and his hands and his legs.
Right, but then they're showing him that he's a Dodeck.
So it starts on first person,
but then as soon as you see yourself, it's in their person.
But does he see it in the back?
Because you don't have to notice it.
Well, let's say it seems to you expand.
As soon as you...
Let's see.
How can I do it?
I can take when you like to do it.
No, you don't see the back of your head.
Yeah, I've had you.
So, imagine...
When the player sees the mirror,
they suddenly...
The screen goes dark.
You see himself.
The screen goes...
It kind of jumbles up.
Right, just down.
And we forget it.
Open.
You got recording?
No.
But it does...
It goes dark.
And...
You can look around the player.
You can navigate around.
And they see his points of light.
They reach toward the first point of light.
They touch it.
And then it expands outward.
It branches outward.
The player is thrust out into the world
and they're in third person.
They're now speaking to the word
you, I, one, self.


# REC033.txt
one self. Oh my gosh I'm gonna tell people who shit. Oh that horse. I mean it's good
dialogue but all I can think of is whack or lose trying to sell bullshit. It's just my
paranoia person myself ignore it. I'll probably just pull it off then that last piece.
No no it's no that's a really good introspective phrase but for me you know
I want to whack a dude who's a they cover up how they do this so hard. Hang on let me
shoot some of your shots too. The word to say. So heads up A3 Lovecraft is a racist
asshole before you get to the rest of it. I'm not gonna lie it's a heads up on that.
I don't think I'm gonna. But he was in the 20s and it's not like he was super racist he was just
he was his racist. Ted. But because it was the 20s so not what you could do back then I suppose.
I just don't want you to be surprised if you look at Lovecraft and you find a bunch of
other things about that. Did you see it?


# REC034.txt
well
I am good
Don't know a thing.
Futuristic, underdeveloped,
Robotic, Android-type, vegetable thing?
Wait.
Ask it and quit.
Ask again.


# REC035.txt
More time asked that. What do you ask? Oh, I said it's a
Do you have familiar with the time like I'm like it's the
Angel vegetable tank. Okay, let me try to just joking around. Oh, you know what? Yeah
You know it looks like though
I know it looks like I'm just joking because you said we sprouted out of the wall. That's what the vegetables they came from
But that I that's the I need a reference of Damon
Oh, I hope it seems I'm I should have seen
Oh
I'm not sure what your machines in there yet. What's up? I'm not sure what your machines in there yet
What do you mean?
Well, I had some robots. Oh, yeah, it's my reference to steer, but I think I think they're I think they're in your chat actually
One of us maybe they're in Roberts chat actually now some of them are here, see?
Oh, there's one of them, but I think I haven't heard the rest. There's a lot more I need to put on your damn
Now we have something to bury
But I have more I know I have more. Oh, keep going on
Well, they're buried in they go from robots because we were supposed to be robots and statues
It was both at the same time. I try pull us off from a post. So everything is buried in with each other to see what's in the real behind
Those more the aesthetics
Those move the robots
It's kind of just mixed up. Okay, we got it. We got to mix it and on the cell same. We got to figure out a way to organize this
What if we have references in the top world? Oh my god
Then I'm gonna do the work. I can't do it actually. I mean, I mean maybe you moderate it. You can join me in this
Oh, no, no, you're on your
No, no, because I need I need you. I need this computer with you to articulate the different
So I'm trying to discover that use my words because if I keep it's not here then
Yeah
Yeah, the robots
Well, we don't need to describe the TEMMU, the TEMMUSHA the TEMMUSHA TEMMUHA TEMMUHA
The TEMMA
It's a temporary body, so it's not going to be any special
You said that there are so
Fruble with those supplies, so the homes are skeletal. It's tens of you. I mean the pieces are located in the chest
So what if what if most TEMMU most of them are
Gofully fledged they have the most of them are actually more machined and more animalistic life
Majority of them are animalistic like but at some point at some of the so few of the TEMMU are humanoid by pedal there
There's social the same way we are they express the same way are the use of music and body language to convey thoughts and feelings
But they don't have facial expressions and they don't have traditional words
Yeah, so they use the
Edict the
Not the edict the
the
The effects on the dough deck as in the body
Imagining that they have a very defined chest
But Lucidine bones think about it more like
Was it more close to the guy in the middle did I show you this one?
Yeah, you showed me that already. Yeah, yeah, they had that more silicone like well
No, but I was talking about for like the temp bodies because we're not gonna make everybody that the fact if it's temp
Body, they're gonna do something a skeletal like this just to control resources. Okay, so the right. It's just
Because if you already said that she gave him a body because it was just a camera. Okay, I brought a torso with him
And then when they get to the lab, she's going to give him legs to imagine the temp body being this is not something that happens often, right?
Yeah, they're not fully prepared for it. So I was they're giving you shut down pieces or what if they get what if they get a player components of robots
That around the area like these are spare parts that can use them to give it a body. No, I know
But that's why I was thinking like instead of a whole chest piece, but it's all fully figured it filled in to define more like bastion
Yeah, well that's what this is because if you look this is mainly just
I think that's the advanced version maybe
The she's one of the poor people. This is one of the lower and yeah
But it's in order the in order the background in order the expression during the context. Yeah, I'm just living exclusively at this piece if you look this is an illusion
These are all more placed if you look behind it. It's empty. It's in space. It's too. I'm right. Yeah, you're right
So I have a human wouldn't have these all these pieces. I have to show you some references. I've got some good ones, but
They're not a hurt go here. Oh
Yeah, see I figured this would be the final version because it's completely go ahead and post that real quick. That's good
JPEC
Jump present
All right
You have seven right in there
Seven seven oh
What do you have
That's great perfect
So that's the advanced piece
Will we say that this one is the beginner go to
That's the context to kind of rinse it. What do you mean the context makes this look more vile?
But it is it's because you have the arms you have the armor or you want to be alert. You want to do me over calm. So imagine
Well, it's not over. It's just space pieces. I've got more references home, but I got
But ration up there real quick
So keep writing because we gotta keep pushing this conversation. You're right
Uh
Go with something more something work. That one's pretty passive one. Yeah
So what response are we on
Chris response over here


# REC036.txt
that can lay a simple system in, and then somehow I'm going to go to a hotel who can't speak
or interact and only watch or not.
For now, but then they can't.
Yeah, but, I mean, that's what we're all trying to do at once right now.
So we're just, that's why it's taking so long.
Okay, so what actually will fleshed out spaces will be easier?
Because here I know we don't even have a makeup tutorial yet.
We'll kind of flush it out with everything.
Okay.
That's why it seems to be taking us so long.
Once we get everything defined, the next session, we'll get more productive as we figure it out.
I think you're right.
So, alright, just real quick.
How would you hate pardon?
How's your facility coming along?
What's that?
Oh, you want to take a tour?
Before he said yes he wants to tour.
It'll be done on Tuesday, whatever.
And then he says,
Well, who are you?
We've already answered this.
We've answered this three times.
I know, yeah, but I gotta keep, I put it back my head.
Okay.
I'm responding to a positive response so properly.
Yes, of course.
Then he asks what kind of research is your team looking into storing?
Well, what is the project that you're going to be doing here?
So he says, he says.
Because he's not.
Yeah, I know what a project is.
He's trying to figure out what a project is.
Or this aspect.
Yeah, you know, I'm kind of curious.
What are you guys working on?
I mean, or, yeah.
Yeah.
What's your project about?
Oh, they had to be great.
What's your project about?
No, that's all right.
That's the second time he told me that it'd be great.
He haven't ended down.
No, it doesn't sound right.
I'm trying to get the saying, right?
What do you mean?
It's not natural enough.
It's not.
I can't act it, right?
Because it's not genuine enough.
It's not genuine enough.
Like the fight, I can't even fight.
Remember, he is elated.
Yeah, he is.
And he's asking what a project is about.
He's elated and desirable.
So how do you write that out without being?
Well, so he doesn't know what it is.
So we got to keep it there.
Maybe he's too excited.
Yeah.
Because he's either.
I think you're envisioning him way more excited than he should be.
Yeah, you're right.
So what?
So just...
Fush out like this.
Forget the rest of the world.
Topless marbles.
All focused on all these two specific people.
That's all you're gonna focus on these two people.
And they were talking about a project that one is really excited about.
She's getting a brand new advertorial, and she's never been here.
She's going to use it.
She's friends with the person that she's talking to.
But she may not have told them what the project is.
So his response is not, if you've feel it as your friend,
she just got a new lever.
something she's been looking forward to. She just said it's finished, but you
don't know the project is it's going to be naturally curious for you to ask what
it is. So what would be a short brief? I don't know. You just said it. What's your
project? I don't know. That would you describe the situation. You describe
their context. You need to give it to me. No, I said it was a question a while ago.
I said you just have to ask what's the project about? What's the project about?
Okay, so just stop that. Yeah. You don't need to have any complex thing. He's not
the focus of the conversation. He feels he's saying he's not going to express
them. What's that you want to know? What's the project about? I just casually
write. Wait, he's elated because she got the lab and he's curious because he
doesn't know what the project is. How's your facility coming along? Hey, how's
your facility coming along? You want to take a tour? Oh yeah, if you want to take
a tour, it'll be done on Tuesday. So we don't need to give it a specific day. Well,
it'll be done soon. There you go. Yeah, it'll soon. And then you have him responding.
Of course, I'll take it to what is he doing. Yeah, sure. I'll take a tour.
Oh, yeah, I'll check it out. No, yeah, I'll check it out. Oh, yeah, I don't want to
check it out. Yeah, I won't check it out. Yeah, I'll check it out. Sure. Sure, that'd be cool.
That'd be great. With a nice facial mark or not? No. How this is the last thing you've
done. So who responds to that? I don't do. We have to play with him at this point.
She now she explains you. Sure, that'd be great. No, I know that, but so do we have the player
coming before she answers or as she answers because we got to figure out one of the dialogue points
to break up with information. Interesting here. I've got to know you. So what if, what if
a card speaks again? So this doesn't know what to say. She's thinking about it a lot.
She's thinking about it too much. Just for a brief second. She gives it positive thought.
And then card and steps and again to clarify. What kind of research are you guys doing?
Well, we're kind of we're kind of research you guys doing. You really want to ask that question?
What kind of, what kind of, what kind of, what do you guys, what are you guys working on?
Oh, no, let's just stick to the research ones so you can get out of your system.
What are you guys working on? So what do you just, what do you decide to work on?
Well, so that's how we're going to do the product instead, isn't it?
Yeah, but we decide isn't like it's like you have an option to you have control over it.
They work, this is not control of the government. Why are you assuming I'm saying control again?
I don't know. I need to assume that's being conveyed to dialogue that this is not the thing.
But that's why he's saying your project. He's not saying a project. He's like, what is your project?
What's your project done? What's your project? What product did you decide on?
That's what we just asked you. Yeah. It will show what's the project.
No, it says, sure, that'd be great. And then he says again, sure.
You want to take it toward? We're done on Tuesday. Sure, yeah, be great.
And then that was mostly pre-faith. I mean, it's what's the end of a question of what's the project?
Yeah, what's the project? But this is when she pauses.
But why not just make it one question?
Because it's more natural conversation. You're trying to emphasize that there are pauses in human conversation.
That real conversation isn't just about.
Because here's what you're having to walk out. You're having to say, this is a casual conversation.
No, I know, but you just have this real break that I'm trying to figure out.
It's very, very minute, but in human conversation, when we're thinking, we could pause on that,
literally about three seconds sentence out. And then he says more. He says this sentence.
And then he says again, he pauses for a second. Just long enough or not to interrupt.
And he jumps in and he says, pause though. That's not.
It's a very subtle pause. He's thinking and then reclerifying.
He says this and say, oh wait, no, I want to express this.
So, the project is an umbrella tone that would cover the resource.
The project is this the broad umbrella tone of what is she walking on?
Okay, so, what do you think is she saying it's done?
I think she's new on to her response.
Sure, that big green. What are you guys working on? And then she says, it's your story.
Okay, yeah, yeah. All right.
Sure, that big green. Yeah, what are you guys working on?
Yeah, what are you guys working on? Yeah, what are you guys working on?
Yeah, what are you guys?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Guys.
Yeah, what are you guys working on?
So, you mentioned she's a bioengineer, so let's stay up to that topic.
What do you think she might talk about?
You said she's a bioengineer, so...
So, actor Genesis?
Maybe, um...
So, why would the...
So, what is your research?
She...
Bioengineering.
Maybe you're...
What is she specifically working on about bioengineering?
Imagine that there is a lot of data.
We haven't fully accepted through yet, or fully understood, so...
Imagine we're pie...
Still piecing together the biological record of Earth.
Because there's stuff we can't speculate on.
We need philosophy and science, and we're considering mathematics.
So, why are we worried about it if they're on a different planet?
Well, I need another system, another...
Imagine they have DNA archives, and they're going through archives,
and they're trying to improve the plant life that exists.
They're trying to reinforce it further than it is.
Because they want to expand further out.
The further you build, the more robust these plants have to be,
to survive the cold or weather.
That's what it is now, just rebuild what...
That was the technology they have keeping the plants alive, whatever they are.
Well, it's more about making...
Because as it goes further in front of the structure,
far from the tower, things get colder.
So, you know, so here's the issue.
You've demonstrated the mass of the cold.
They're not...
You're right.
So, it's not that.
So, what would be...
I'm going to be pessimistic again.
Let me try that again.

Uh, we're advancing flavor profiles.
So the question is,
then we have to go to the next question
do we have the AEI coming now?
What do we carry on with that?
Oh,
my idea was, is having
asked for the question and then the AEI come in,
and then we just drop the question.
Well, how long can the player wait and listen?
Well, so honestly what you have is probably about a minute of conversation,
once this is actually what's accumulated.
How long do you think the player might wait and just
before I didn't realize it could have the proper screened down the booth,
like I said, a little prompt, hey, you can move with the left stick.
Well, I wouldn't say that, but I would.
Maybe have, so you said that they notice him, right?
Maybe as he's talking, since she's looking,
oh, he's looking that way.
And we're on her response, correct?
So have it all be getting her response and have him wave.
I'm not necessarily talking.
He's still paying attention to the whole,
but I have to be looking wave.
So the player comes to him.
So what if, what if, what if the, what if the,
what if the, that's going to be wild to the notice him?
So what if the conversation starts as soon as the player breaks free of this little,
it's a, um,
it's a protective shell over it because it's been a long time,
and the player is tapped, like,
like, you're breaking through an egg, right?
And you're, you play your city sprouted out of the wall though.
It is sprouted out of the wall.
It's waiting, but it's not, it's not hatched yet,
per se.
They know where they see it.
It's advanced in this area.
But then it, it's, it's like the player,
you imagine the player's perspective, right?
You're, you're a camera,
and you're in this enclosure you see.
So you moved with left straight.
That doesn't work.
Okay, you hit it.
You move with right stick.
Okay.
So you moved both, you know,
oh,
you break through.
So you have to,
this teaches the player to use left stick and right stick.
Without them, you can have them now.
Plus, that has to do with the conversation at all.
Because as soon as they break through,
they're aware.
Okay.
So it's, it's going to play notes that
as soon as the player figures it out,
they can move.
You know, it's accidental.
They're like, oh, cool.
And they're through, you know,
they do two at once,
and then they...
Game design, ideas, sorry.
No, you guys are like,
what does it have to do with the conversation?
I'm trying to reduce the overall scope of the conversation.
We're trying to keep it minimal.
So it, the immediate conversation,
if you break through the shell,
as soon as the player finds out how to move.
So I'm trying to make that break point as well.
Okay, we get right now.
We make a little bit more dialogue,
because the player could take a little longer.
So let's say...
Oh, so literally...
30 seconds.
I'm not even talking about that.
I'm talking about ending the conversation now.
I'm talking about,
have him foam half a thought,
and then the player comes in.
Okay, half a...
Okay.
So we're kind of...
we're working on the player profiles.
And then having them...
I'm still asking,
oh, what kind?
And then just end the dialogue
and have the player come in.
And then we just tone the focus to the player.
What would you say,
oh, what would subset?
What subset of color profiles?
Oh, what subset?
Well, you never realize
he's not into that kind of resource,
so you're finding out...
Oh, what kind of...
What kind of...
Huh.
What kind of...
Well, you don't have to finish it.
Just stop it at what kind,
and then do dot dot dot to show a break.
And then the player comes in.
It's interesting.
What kind?
And see,
then we end it there,
the player comes in,
and then we decide where it goes from there.
Unless you want to take a break.
Um...
Yeah, let's take a trip break.
That's...
It's...
Yes.
It's interesting.
That's interesting.
What kind?
And then the player breaks through the breaks to the glass.
Player at turn.
Ideally.
We've gone up to 8 minutes about it again, right?
Well, 10 now,
he strikes the breaking scene.
This is an event so like...

Where's careful.
She's an ordinary model of robotics that we have in our storecraft, too.
She is in a cell that is still fabulous to show it in the walls.
I just really like this design style.
It looks like a couple of like this, and I want you to talk to you overhead, which is connected
with it.
Okay.
So, imagine, catch your armors just to just get out of it.
Yeah, it's not sorry.
And now at the
people look next, people like Head.
Do you ever imagine these...
Or the...
Oh, it goes to them.
It's out close.
Tell, tell what...
Tell us, tell us.
Yeah, tell us, tell us where it's in your walls.
They've become a tenor or a burn-shaped.
They're five kilos, but they have a rubric head.
The tenor was the back.
The subtle tenor was not very light-brates, most.
But they're 20.
Light-brates.
No, I know what she went.
Like the image you showed me.
When I get home, I don't know how to put together some references.
Pretty yummy.
I'm just going to be in ten here real quick.
What is it?
I don't know.
I'm just going to be scared of this guy.
So, where's the pencil actually?
It's because it's on the wall now.
Sure, that'd be great.
Yeah, what are you guys working on?
That's more curiosity.
That would have been great because of the A guy was coming in.
Well, that's his.
But they're breaking it here.
That's interesting.
What kind?
End of breaks.
But I still want to convey the intent.
Written out.
What do you mean by that?
You get the symbols.
I have got one, two, three here without symbols.
And that's saying that any exercise the language right in my head?
So, what do you turn to accomplish?
I'm trying to accomplish the eating based intent.
Reconciliation link.
No, I know what I'm talking about.
So, pick one.
And this will do the thing.
You can't go through all the ones you need to pick one to start with.
Okay.
Yeah, we're guys working on it.
But yeah, we're guys working on it.
So, the curiosity.
Can you ask me?
That's a nice break.
Come on, I'm here.
Okay.
Okay.
So, curiosity has a desire.
Yeah, which has worked on it.
Okay.
And...
Desiring and...
I think it's just genuine curiosity by itself.
Anyway, so we're working on profiles.
Working on failure profiles.
I don't know.
It was curiosity and...
And it was curiosity and it says, I think, that's prototype.
If the intensity of curiosity.
Okay, so...
High intensity.
This one.
Low intensity is two, three intensities.
Okay.
Remember...


# REC038.txt
You remember, um, Sekiro?
Or Simba's?
Imagine the brightest symbol in the system,
being like it's pure curiosity, pure aggression,
pure anxiety, whatever.
And you have two symbols that you're dividing it.
And now you have, they're medium brightness,
and then, uh, three, and it's slow as brightness.
So that represents intensity.
But overall, all represents the division at which we have our
expressions, have our, um, what do we call them, effects.


# REC039.txt
Yeah we're working on flyer profiles.
Oh, that's interesting, that's interesting, that's what we're talking about, that's interesting.
So at this point I think they need to use empathy, this character needs to use empathy
to understand what their intent is there, the chicken response, empathy or trust, I trust your intent,
so I need to be there, E and pride, empathy and pride, that's interesting, that's interesting,
okay, that's interesting, we're kind, minor curiosity, so we're, we're moderate curiosity,
so that's desire, oh that's interesting, we're kind, and desire and misery, desire and aversion,
no desire and empathy, all right, you use empathy if you're too in a situation,


# REC040.txt
She's attached to the other one.
Oh, yeah.
Trick down human.
Yeah.
I'll try to find her.
She's weird.
She kind of sets you down on the path on the game.
Let's take that one.
That's beautiful.
That's good.
Good job.
All right.
He's in a video.
I won't move.
Can you go?
There's no tomorrow morning.
Down there.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Huh?
What's up?
I got a chance to come over to JPEGs.
Oh.
They're showing the camera.
It's what happened yesterday.
This will save me some of them.
All right.
Say that.
Need to drink.
Oh, you're going to go to the file first.
They're talking about it here.
So great.
Pretty roughness.
Let's see.
We're using them.
I'm going to try again.
No, I have to create that actually.
Create it too.
Okay.
Looks nice, too.
Okay.
Let's see.
Let's try your documents.
We're going to put your downloads.
One second.
One second.
I know why I did this yesterday.
It can't get hot.
What's up?
It's an incinerator.
It's an incinerator.
So it's fine.
It's the home drawer.
I don't know.
It's fine.
It's the home drawer.
I don't know.
I don't even keep it.
It's really cold.
It's fine.
So the cold is probably the same.
It's a ballad man, thank you.
Not for a long time, otherwise.
I love the temperature.
60 degrees.
60 degrees.
65 degrees.
65 degrees.
Like that.
Yeah.
Try the best part of that one.
Save us.
Can you try it again?
What's up?
How'd you fix it?
We'll hang it up with paint.
So we saved this one.
And we just got this one with it.
Oh.
Save us.
Or it's that you still save us, can you?
Well, I see.
Are you sure if the chance is of the J-packs?
Is it?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
It's kind of there.
I'll just draw it down like that.
I don't know.
Cool.
They save us, can you do so?
Well, I say, when we download it,
I don't know when this happens.
Oh, yes.
And then, we get that one.
These are all those.
And then we get them already.
I thought you draw them.
You just laid it.
Okay.
And five, no, it's here.
Six.
No, that's the yesterday.
We're going to do the five here.
We're going to do the five here.
We're going to do the five here.
We're going to do the five here.
We're going to do the five here.
We're going to do the five here.
Where's the name's Nego's?
No, I just kept the basic thing.
I said, yeah, I think that was one of these.
I mean, we could have named it Nego's.
It was four four.
There was something.
Yeah, that saved us a different way.
So, this is all files from yesterday.
Is there anything I downloaded today?
Oh.
Did it save you your exports tomorrow?
Just give me a second, please.
Yeah.
Let's see, calm down.
You're fine.
Sorry.
Okay, so let's finish this up.
All right.
So, what are we stuck on?
We're doing something.
We're not stuck on anything now.
We got past it.
The players are reduced.
And now we have to...
Okay.
So, symbols are there.
All of them?
Yeah.
Um...
I'm going to go back and say that this...
Okay.
Is there anything there?
Um...
Is there anything there?
Well, then I've got this thing, man.
Uh, should I take a picture of the bunch from us?
Yeah.
Well, because we're not going to keep this up.
From.
We're going to save them on the right, silly.
I find that you have a picture here.
You can see it's real.
Like I don't know.
I'm going to try the one.
I found some space in the middle of it.
And from a magic door.
I'll still have it.
I'll just take this one.
Okay.

And it led to his breakup of his forced marriage because of it because his wife wanted to be around these evil
She was very full of thinking and he was very
Fucking brown people
Oh, not even joking. He wrote it in his letters. If you were around people that want the same race as him
He would get nervous
He would get paranoid and afraid
He had a very unique childhood. He was raised by his aunts and his mom in an exclusively hold courier
He had a very poor look on women because of it
So why do you think he still saw the other people?
People of other dissents
As not being the same because he was locked in his room pretty much for most of his life. So that probably led to isolations
He had his only contact with his mom who was the same skin color
So he had a very little trust
Well, you got in and we're back here and people who were looked visually different so back then race resolution was not a fringe topic
It was the mainstream topic
They believed that different colors
Every word of phonology
It's the study of the score shape
They would rub your skull and could figure out your whole personality by your shape in the skull
Oh, so does Bolshev's mind breaks? Yeah, well a common astrology a common thing of phonology was
White people had a more developed frontal area
Which meant they were of a higher species
Brown people had a smaller one which was close to the eggs
And that was a popular theory when he was growing up
So he probably hold this day from his aunts and his mom and it was reinforced in him
Because he'd only been around white people who were rich his whole life and then now he's around these poor foreigners
And so he went from this quiet transit proper society to being around actual people
And it just chagged in him this xenophobia
This in your sound
But what is in the context of the game the symbol what is the feeling of racism as people so that distrust is it
So racism isn't a hatred
It's a typically attachment. It's a fear anxiety
Because that's what it is. It's fears racism
This feels when the anger because it's a natural human
So it can be fear or anger
Totally it's all just fear
Fear anger and so typically this is what racism is. It is a belief that they were out to do you home
Your race horn or they are out to take away your power
Racism is a very sponsored based off of either the anxiety of them taking away a power
Fear of bodily home or fear of somehow damaging or contaminated
And then when you call it enmity or empathy
Empty because you hate you see what you want these people gone
Like lack of empathy
It's not a lack of it. It's a you won't just hate them. I don't think
It's so a lot of racism is bred to the notion of hate is made through
anger and
Yeah, okay, but the creation that so you're using these two these three anger fear and
enmity as in the lack of care to create hate and
So racism it's
You're using the inhale of the same thing
The synodic no hate is aggression
Fear is already descriptive to speak. No, but hate in in in the breaking of down. He is
Engraining so if you already have anger anxiety, you're not gonna put hate because that's what hate it
That's we see all three symbols because it contains the entire thing
No, no hate is one of the things you anger and there's three right?
Hate is one of them. He's the combination of two of them and the combination of three is
Racism, you know, that's all it's it's it's it's distress
Huh, so why is it gonna be racism?
No, I'm trying to define the word
I mean
Because I need to exercise my brain in terms of how these things are
Created in the human mind
I need to define the bad as well as the good and this is part of bad
Society doesn't have it
I know it doesn't but I imagine so so then why are we trying to figure it out?
Because the better I could figure it out the better can emphasize with those that commit harm that do harm that do bad
We don't but no one believes it's up to evil and there's this
Because the more of language I can understand the better I particularly I don't need to put us on the game
It's about the like one beyond the game itself
But putting my foundation on knowledge of the systems and your finition all systems using this as an exercise for
Breaking down
Human
Well affects so we're not trying to break down human affects. So what we're trying to do is assign them to after we have
Well, we're doing called to define them
Why are we wasting time when we're not in the music is my question because we're listening to
Contest
Yes, but it's not like it's everywhere. This is really just I was trying to do your head job. We need more optimistic
This isn't talking. What system is the negative? We're optimistic
Well, then why do I avoid discussing it because maybe it's it
There's no string about avoid discussing it. It's just you don't really
You just built your society though patient though kind and empathetic. There's no scarcity
Typically racism is led by scale city or power that like you don't have a partner in that
Well, imagine racism being the extreme and lack of empathy being the
You already established you don't have that issue in society
Exactly. So we got to move on from this
To the one that brought the subject in the full space
You're going to want to be talking about it. It doesn't go on. Let's see. Let's make sure you agree with that
If the tension is working, let's try it again. Let's just
I'm just trying to figure out


# REC042.txt
break them down, but why not break down ones that we're actually going to use?
Let's take a...
It's jealousy.
What is jealousy?
It means you're system to build it.
Okay, so jealousy is...
jealousy is a want.
It is a want desire.
That's the only thing.
You desire something.
That the want is...
It's not tied to that exact want.
It means it's a curiosity.
I know I need to explain it to myself.
I know what you already explained to me.
It's very difficult to...
I have.
I just give you the...
the symbols.
I have very good symbols.
I have very good symbols.
I'll give you the symbols.


# REC043.txt
I think you're getting way off track.
So what are we doing right now?
I am taking the 12 symbols to convey words
having our language that have connotations tied to them
that are necessarily representative of what that thing is.
In human, yeah, in terms of human effects.
It's a nice sense.


# REC044.txt
Yeah, I'm just starting to go
So I need any day
Okay, there's no center there's there's for me. There's also pride
I'd keep telling myself that because I'm not sure when I'm gonna pick up on these notes
I have days and days of notes to go through
So it's actually a difficult to ever channel us knowledge
I'm so sorry
Like every time we talk about the whole symbols you have made it is like come on. I understand we have four symbols now made here. Okay, I get up. Okay
I will do this


# REC045.txt
that you're going to use to break down walls.
That isn't what we're walking on now.
We're all trying to build it.
Yes, the plot line, so-called, and not even after a plot,
I'm more bullet points.
So, so-called, all we have is about 10 minutes of a scene,
a flat, and if we really want to be orange,
it's close to like three minutes, seven minutes,
and you stretch it.
That's three minutes of that is going to be music,
interestingly.
We're only going to need 15 minutes of content.
So they engage the player.
So we get in the end of the space jet,
they do this sequence to get their money.
We've literally got the first minutes, maybe seven,
but honestly, I posted a four or five.
We need to push ahead.
Okay.
We keep getting swept up in these side things.
We need to just focus still.
We have the player coming in now.
So we'll learn these as we go.
We have to know them all now, but-
I will learn them as I go.
I will get the last four to describe,
so we can better check out these as we need them.
Well, because that's the thing,
it's not your two pairs in the building,
because we don't even have all of them yet.
Well, me and we do have-
I need to personally.
I think the time and verify this system is viable.
In the context, we need to break down all the words.
Let me show you how this works.
We don't have the other four.
The city has some genres.
Yeah.
That's why I'm using E for enmity,
and P for pride, and-
Oh, E-M for empathy, and then-
I would resign here, and prove that I did not pour.
And then enmity might be E-M.
I need some rest, because this-
It's not too late.
It's a couple of conversations.


# REC046.txt
It's going to make sense later on.
Okay.
Okay.
Look at that stick.
Yeah.
Although it's a priori, once we need to be consistent,
this interior wasn't fully new,
but for your phone, it's probably the same.
No, it's the same.
Of which, it's the same, but it can't be.


# REC047.txt
I'm glad you paused it
That's what I pause is like oh this is coming up
I appreciate
I might minimize recording that I might minimize recording that we can pause every now and then
That's true
Yeah, you're right
Yes, interesting ideas, but he's a racist breaks
He's just racist and scared he's he's scared
It's painful aggression
That sucked when I found it out and see who's my favorite growing up
Oh
I'm a fucked up part of those so maybe even catch the racism
He just felt right over my head. He just fell right over his head
I didn't catch it till I read you read it without a little
He hasn't raised the
Haven't they described this without sounding back
South
Lovecraft he tends to build these species that are locked away
I'm all you not modern day, but it's somehow survived till now to the help of courts and their own ability
And one of those he sent a curve to into the jungle who found a
Apes aside
And for some reason he ended up fucking one and bringing home his half son half gorilla half human
And then started drinking divorced his wife and brought a gorilla over and that he can't his wife
And
But if you read it, so it sounds real when if you read it and you really pay attention to the allegor
He paints you really some little black
Yeah, I didn't know as I tell him to my older girls and it's like
Wow, okay
Yeah, like you just changed the world eight before black. Oh my god
It walks so well that E.L. is intentional
Christ
Because he ended up having hit by him mixing his blood of the
monster
It became when it grew up and he became monstrous and ugly at the stinger
Angry and petty and kill them for his footer. Yeah
And then it becomes a recording villain in his story
I
Was this funny because I wonder how he'd take it
He's the other orders have to molded him into the entire bloodline
So when from this throw a character is going across important bloodlines in the character
Because they use them in the game the even reference him
It's like I wonder if I'm gonna make him happy that his throw a character became a main focal point
So what I love about sinking city is it's the lazy area
But they replace the black people
No, no, this is on the game. This is how we did it because like I said, love catches races
So in love craft he has this race of people that are half thick half
You know when you're actually one one
Yeah, they're a fisheries. Yeah, yeah, they're a fisheries
A mix of
Fat and animals
The primordial link that the bodies of combination about they have like symmetrical cell growth of the top down vegetables
But though again
They're also super advanced like the ability to see
He's like twice old. They have they don't have a vocal system. They have like a musical
They use a mix of musical tones and moving their hands to talk that's a good reference
Is there a visual for that or a no? It's all literature, but that's also a mountain of madness
All right, so imagine


# REC048.txt
What do you call those things? The systems that communicate the old ones.
The old ones have that kind of communication. They have symbols through to music.
And they have and they have symbols through.
So they use pictographs, movements, dots and sounds.
Dots.
It's a time stamp that I'm going to pick up for you and found the madness.
They have hieroglyphs, but next to the hieroglyphs is a series of zards.
They describe as intercyclical of the earth.
You can tell if you had a higher meaning or understanding that they have a profound number 10 silver.
That's why I love it. He doesn't give you all of it, but he teases you with it.
That's why I hate it. It's such an amazing driver.
Why are you crazy man? Why are you crazy man?
You know I'd say that.


# REC051.txt
So, overall describing the system, you're starting from...
So, my only issue is you make these points, and you're using them to dive in narrative,
but you're not explaining them to us.
Well, you don't have to.
It's more of a...
No, not to the characters, I mean to me, or to the other people helping me build this.
We don't know the points that are driving me.
I don't think everyone needs to know, I think you and I need to know it.
That's my point, is you haven't even told me yet, though.
I've been doing it to what point?
I told you just about everything.
I can express for this so far.
So, you just dropped...
So, you just dropped those...
No, no, no, no.
Oh, that's near to you.
But I'm trying to...
What I'm talking about is the spacing, because you were talking about putting...
12 and 4 around...
So, if you think about it, okay.
You might think it's like a catastrophic, but it's like a catastrophic.
There is a gradient.
So, how do you get in two buried in detail?
What I'm trying to figure out is how many people are doing it in a certain way this time.
There's a gradient in social spaces, and we can get the average.
We can get the median of each.
Imagine like a...
A particular earthquake chart.
You know, I'll get this more serious.
And then I'll talk about...
I just need to know a number.
Okay.
Four.
Four for the bedroom.
Ten.
Four for the four.
Okay.
Sixteen for the...
Sixteen for the heart.
Well, I'm going to ask you to justify the size of this.
Well, this is just mathematics.
This is mathematics.
This is...
Mathematics is the average.
Right, so...
So, how did you get your average?
The average is...
Based on...
You know, behavior.
Like, okay.
So...
The average is based on your population.
Let me be honest.
Buying is...
Buying is generating these.
The number, the button number bias.
The category bias.
So, what are the...
Four, eight...
The population is two, three times all population.
You have 20 billion people in centers.
Right.
Okay, so, what if you do that?
What if you do...
20 billion?
No, what if you do the...
What if you do the...
So, what an easy to figure out is...
We have to figure out their social space.
Oh, idea.
Okay, so...
Mathematics is so large.
They've been about hundreds of years, thousands of years.
They've had children.
They've grown community.
They've built that work.
And...
There are...
Trillions.
Not trillions.
Billions.
Billions are 20 billion.
So, we're raising the count.
50 billion.
Yeah, 80 billion.
Like, these things...
Okay.
So, this is very relevant.
If you keep...
I need to know...
Actual cow.
Okay.
Let's say there are 35 billion in a given disc.
A given area.
Well, I know.
I mean, it's for a total amount.
Total amount.
Let's say this thing is...
How many meters high?
You think...
How high is the atmosphere?
I don't know.
It's your rule.
See?
It's your rule.
Nice.
And I'm going to ask Google.
Where's my phone?
So, here's my thing.
If you keep trying to use real-world information
to the world that doesn't exist.
And we'll severely...
The world that is...
Well, I don't know.
More than people know us.
Let's say it's as...
It's as far...
It's...
It's not as dense as...
It's actually more lightweight.
It's a cold planet.
They're heating it up.
It won't last forever
because the atmosphere is going to dissipate.
But...
They're bringing it to a point of utopia
that they can continually renew
because of their extreme access to energy.
They can renew the atmosphere hypothetically.
They just can't produce more helium
so they see its structure.
And it's...
What if we can break it down?
What if we can make a helium?
So what if we can break it down?
The breaking down...
The shell world...
Of...
This...
This planet.
It's not stripping me to ceiling three.
It's actually me with the material
that the dogs have enough.
They're trying to figure it out when you break it down.
But, um...
So what are they...
Right now, I'll break it down the shell.
Because it's...
It's falling...
It is a shell of dodex.
It's me and a dodex.
They're filling that with those resources there.
Grabbing them.
Um...
The dodex connected to the other.
Is that...
Who's...
Nah, I'm still in the process now.
But imagine that...
This is just the exterior.
If you dig for it enough,
underneath the layers and layers of dodex,
you find a room wall.
And I think that something is underneath all those dodex
because they've seen hints.
Okay, so...
I don't know who you don't.
You feel bored, so you don't know anything.
Uh-oh, okay.
I don't know.
You're a cabiler.
You can't think about this.
This is your god.
This is a yes or no.
This is the maybe.
You're right.
You're...
You're...
You're boring the whole idea.
I need you to realize you are the creator.
You get to decide.
There is no maybe.
It's your say of the rules.
Okay, I'm saying the rules.
And my rule is that there is a room wall
inside this ring collection of dodex.
But no, nothing else.
It's not the rings.
That's what I need.
You want to go after me.
If you talk about this ring wall,
you haven't given me a visual for it yet.
That would really help me out.
I'm figuring it out.
Because I'm trying to...
Okay.
I have the exoplanet.
That's going to push it all.
The one that he said is like...
It's denser than a planet.
So I know it's not a polar planet.
I know it's not a moon.
I know it's artificial.
I know it has the endings.
You don't know the endings.
You just see them.
And wish to show me.
I don't even tell me that.
I don't even tell me that there's a distance here.
Nearby.
And we just got the distance here.
And we haven't discovered the real world yet.
I only remember some going with his halo.
Oh, God.
Should we please put it?
Why are you so sensitive to the world?
No, it's not that.
I just let you distract him again.
You only have to pick another one
when he doesn't have that.
Because that seems to freeze your mind.
Every time you hear it, you just...
It's a cringe.
It's a cringe.


# REC052.txt
So there is one thing, you can have a five-story kick you out for a minute, just so you can cook.
Five-thirty? Yeah. You can come right back with it.
Come on, after I eat. Why does one take a minute?
Could you re-describe, but I just try to take it like there?
What's that? Could you re-describe it? I try to re-describe it like that, because I do break it down too much.
You simplify it for me. What are you trying to reticulate?
This is my just explain.
Dyson's home, Dyson's spirit.
Okay, I gotta hang on. Okay, give me a second.
So I can re-describe it fully.
So imagine, hypothetically, that there is layers and layers of these dot X on the moon, the shell world that they see a moon.
They don't know the shell world. They do not know it is a shell world.
They believe it to be a moon, a storage of energy.
It is, but it has a shell world beneath the core.
Between the beneath the mantle of this, the structure of the moon, a shell world, but they don't know it is a shell.
They believe it is a core.
They believe that there is a core, because they've witnessed it on their structure.
Imagine that the dot X span up.
They're all over that structure.
Yeah, let's try this. Let's try this.
And it covers the ring world.
Imagine that you're thrusting a pole into the ground.
Right in the sand.
And you have to dig it in there, right?
Imagine you're taking a beam that supports civilization.
You're thrusting it into the pillar.
You're using it as a foundation.
Pro-born.
You're using it as a support structure.
You build it off in there.
The dot X...
They'll kind of move out of the way to skin.
It's kind of weird, but you can use like bracelets.
You're pulling objects into a living structure.
And it takes them to whatever you throw into it.
If you're at the bottom, there's a middle.
But it's not enough for two point these two points.
They believe that there's a solid physical structure there.
And then they translate that understanding to the moon.
And listen and believe that.
You've got a higher rate of spiritual difference.
They haven't managed it.
They're so dense that they don't know how it's built.
They haven't built strong tools to dig that far into the structure.
Because it's the density of that mantle of the Moses.
So it's like limitation technology.
So do they know about the ring?
They hypothesize that it's there.
That's where they've been doing a lot of my...
They've been pulling dot X off skin.
They're not skinned.
They're trying to like leros.
Yeah, they're digging the way into it.
Using like a mining, a reverse mining system.
You're digging into it.
It'll look pretty much the opposite.
Yeah, I'll tell you.
But they're fighting against whatever structure is trying to push them back.
So it's not dangerous.
And they've had little more technology that they haven't strong enough.
So it is very secure.
Because they have the right text.
Imagine like taking a pair of pliers and pushing it with you.
You're doing it all the same.
You're doing it all the same.
And it's power.
And the speed is away.
And the swell is fade.

It's not necessarily it's a little optimistic, but it's not still it's okay. I don't even tell
We still pass mystery things in this the world
Really steam punk is
Technology but the summons that is bad
But there's a lot of coal there's a lot of
That means it's a water running water you're pointing water to get the coal
Well, so the whole point was they stopped at the Victorian era of steam
This is that makes sense to the era. It does work. It's not that easy, right?
So stairs I think you can get a mistake
Psychopunct is society seemhunk is purely visual
The society aspects, but the same thing was never really built as a whole society
When only you read the steam punk it's never
The whole society it's more needs more like an add-on to the act of society
So I'm thinking
Independent of itself
Solar punk is a
Optimistic science fiction future if it is there's there's lush green
Society's are close. There's no there's no there's there's there's
Minimal but no no violence. There's still you know things happen people get arrested people
People do these things
But there's not so much
Hayden's distrust that there's a
Presumption sorry, like we have today. Yeah people are close people understand people on the sides people
Yeah, there's that I mean that's why you build better social spaces
So as I've tried to explain to one of my artists
Robert
He's doing the architectural stuff and the city like that stuff right now
I need to explain to him to that that I
You have the bedroom
One of two people and before an on occasion. You have a living room
You know one two four three and four maybe two two is pretty pretty pretty freaking but three and four happened to
People in the space you're using the space so the room is usually three to four
So why are the two to four?
Two to four in the bedroom because that's like co-op space right? It's it's a
Four close friends. I'm not a four front four friends
Five so you would have the four rooms space
Yeah, yeah, okay, okay, oh four room space. That's good. Okay, so you have the bedroom. I'd argue
You're the bedroom. You have the four room. You have the living room and you have the heart
Which is the combination of the four room and living room and then you have
Like an office space or a bathroom shower. You have
stairs you have
kitchen areas
Open space
You know for comfort and for
Then the matter of the space there is determines how social area is I think that if you average it out
For is optimal for for the bedroom that most
Eight or 12 or by the optimal 12 is like a lot, but it's still a small 12 for a bedroom
Heart so
Now 12 is the maximum potential. It's not the average the average is maybe like
five
Seven
It's not just about families about social groups
There's not
You're right. I think that you're right. I think about I imagine you would have it only
You have to have it isolated units. We should have a partner like this, but they're more
They're encouraged to be social we have a porch. It's open
A place that's you can see other people that you can see you you interact more you socialize more and you have
You have an event
Well, yeah, like this, but you have to be asked to be more in a
What do you call it a encouraged means need to be open more up because this is not open
patio
If I stand up I can't see the side more direct them below
If they they
In so I can so I'm I'm
Social isolated to you or you are in that space for the porch the porch is not meant for relaxing the porch is meant for
So it's a
I think that's we have a space is to find a to my space or space stay away
I really may have we have should be more open in these spaces we designed to architecture
No, it's it's really you're really using foreign spaces more
Yeah, the people are good too, but the people are are a they we are behavior behavior driven and I think you give if you have a behavioral
Optical spaces
They interact more closely they interact more trusted trusting so I don't think there's spaces they're not trusting
It's I know it's good. I'd argue that it's I'd argue that roads are the biggest factor because there's no there's no community spaces
Anymore in these areas imagine if you had research research facility
Yeah, there's gathering areas is little space. It's between the living and the far off and dust
Cars are the biggest division the factor and we made them proficiency, but they are better
There's a big difference in fact because they create roads roads
Tribes how road divide roads to rivers divide kingdom
No, it's it's it's it's cultural spaces spaces that are
Spaces that could be could complete right then said we're we're separate. We are we this is
United States as a general culture, right?
We have a general culture in the United States or Africa or or or or India or any of its interest but India your point actually, so they have
These social spaces like the main area the main main capables they speak English and Indian right that the
I have a caste system
Well
That's the culture the culture of the other culture
They divide themselves exactly
That's the issue is they have a caste system well
Depending on your caste
The rich are leads on top of each elite. They don't talk to the house. So that's why they're
That's what I'm so divided in terms of because if you travel 100 miles out from the capital
You know the language is the secondary language
Yeah, that's a different cast, but English and entire places is a universal language. They can't communicate
It's just these are tied to the culture as well
It's a result
So that's not a
We all get the roads why we're all in English, huh?
Would you all get the roads also help contribute to the more new ways?
One more time, wouldn't you all get the roads hope though helped contribute to them all in English?
The roads Romans
It did
Let's say it did help for a while, but we built out words
Unknowing to our biology
Well, this is why I need to I need to design the space
Tribes
So for a time
Violence got more severe as people got divided
But then we found in the NNF found social we found the means of communicating beyond
Yeah, the roads came first the roads pocket Roger came for the NN
So the roads hope for why we have in it. Okay, so we don't have roads and we wouldn't have a garage
Okay, so

Cybernetic harms and limbs and... I mean, not too common, but when they're needed, they're
available.
And if someone's having trouble with difficulty walking or vice-legs, sometimes this isn't
one with limbs, they can do that, they can fix it.
Imagine technology being as abundant and thoroughly developed as being imaginative to be
in the future.

change and adapt about its name when we want to, using the technology available to us.

due to our bipedal nature. So in order for the birth to now to be
because we're bipedal, birth can always smaller and therefore babies have to be
born earlier. And earlier birth enabled, well had to enable earlier development
and early development led to more potential I suppose. We are one of the few species
that is not born completely capable. We can't walk on our own for quite a
while. We're vulnerable. We need socialization. We need community otherwise. We cannot
propagate species. We cannot persist.

You're thinking about conversation too, conversation too, linearly.


# REC023.txt
Okay. So, you think about conversation too linearly. You have the player and the interlocutor,
but you should also try to consider that these two NPCs are acting independently from the player,
and they will have their own conversation. They will talk about their own things they want to talk about.

So instead imagine more of a timeline with multiple topic points
and these topic points introduce new topics.
I guess, new tangent points.
No, they introduce new tangent points and you take topics.
Take tangents through topics, if that makes sense.
So NPC is talking.
A new tangent appears in the other option and you select that tangent.
Before another one fades.
You figure it out, imagine two timelines.
One going up and down, the player, and then they can jump in multiple points and you have the...
Yeah, the horizontal timeline I suppose.

a conversation held by two NPCs. The player can jump in and ask questions as needed to get
better information. It's not mandatory but new tangents appear and the tangents are like
questions or not really statements. Staments are made in more of the interpersonal context
conversations held by the player and some other NPCs. But in the context of multiple NPCs
talking to each other, the player can step in and ask questions. It can get better

So, the antlers pillars are crystalline structures that have grown like trees.
You can find them in the ground and they all grow with the necessary structures.
And then, I guess, how would you hold them out? I wonder.
Is that literate, though? Is that cyan typical literate?
Could you have grown crystalline structures that were durable enough to support?

All right, Brain, you need two things as we can.
You need to get a scraper or the frost that will accumulate in your car.
No, three things, actually. Scraper for the car windows.
And you need to get a jacket.
Actual jacket because this can't get fucking freezing as hell.
That was a weird term of phrase.
Anyway, third thing you need.
Ah, cocoa.
No, no.
Yes, and no.
Third thing you need is probably bean bags.
But kind of a housewarming present for Jade.
And hopefully another adjuster of good faith.
I'd hope she does all right.
And I am confident she will pay me back.
Just be kind.
Don't be open.
Be honest.
Be kind.
Don't be a dick.

The visitor sits beside the bed and Ripley finally notices him. He is thirtyish and handsome, in a suit that looks executive or legal, the tie loosened with studied casualness. A smile referred to as winning.
MAN
Nice room. Im Burke. Carter Burke. I work for the company, but other than that Im an okay guy. Glad to see youre feeling better.

Burkes rough age.
That hes decent-looking.
Hes a suit, but trying not to look like a suit.
He seems friendly  but theres something possibly false about it.

A list of guidelines for creating characters 
1. Name, Age, Appearance
2. Objective: What do they want, if the novel turned out in their favor?
3. Motivation: Why does your character want this, what drives them?
4. Stakes: What is the consequence of not meeting that goal? What could go wrong?
5. Obstacles: What's standing in the way of the character acheiving this goal? (internal, external)
6. The Past: What happened to the character? How did they come to be who they are?
7. Flaws: Affecting their journey in a negative way. Hinderance to overcome.
8. Relationships: How they relate to other characters in the story.
9. What would make each character angry?
10. What would make the character happy?

Character introduction - The best character introductions tend to include both a sense of what you see (the characters physical appearance) and an intriguing tidbit about their personality and/or situation. 
 How do you want the reader to feel about this character?
 Using the sense of sight, make a list of what the POV character notices about physical appearance
 Consider the other senses
 What personal impression does the character make?
 Write a description let it rest, then edit

A list of guidelines for writing dialogue - Every line I write should do one of those four things. Or at the very least, be artistically valuable. In humor or narrative aesthetics.
1. What does this line tell me about the world?
2. What does this line tell me about the character? 
3. What does this line tell me about the other characters?
4. Does this line move the plot forward?

If someone in the group dies; with exception to Oski or Vali, Gregers will disappear and never return. 

If Jo dies, Lorens will breakdown. He will not be able to continue the mission. 

Develop Oski's character, get him to bond with the others. He makes sacrifices his safety to preserve the life of Vivian. His main storage is left unaffected, but he can no longer interact with anyone. Vivian holds it close and faces away from the group. She sobs for a while, out of fear for her life and the near loss of a friend. She ties Oski's drive to her neck. It's encased in protective materials.

Littlenorwegians: First of all, all our dogs have "hund" in their name. This is for Norwegian, Swedish and Danish, actually. And they're usually descriptors.
Glitch: e.g.?
Littlenorwegians: Like "Elghund" means "moose-dog". Used to hunt moose

Glitch: hm, good starting point
Glitch: I'm also thinking about the perspective of the player. I want to demonstrate that the world differs from our own with the opening description writing, and a creature that wouldn't 'quite' fit the conventional dog appearance, might be useful to convey that.
Littlenorwegians: Heh, I have an idea for that, if I may, that I think could be effective.
Glitch: shoot
Littlenorwegians: When it comes to dog. Man's best friend. Since the dawn of time itself. The world might have changed. The breed might have changed.
Littlenorwegians: But they're still our best friend
Littlenorwegians: After all these years
Littlenorwegians: That kinda thing, I think, is potent. And grounds things. If you have a dog in your story, you want to have it for dog-reasons. Dog characters are good companions, sympethetic, lovable, those kinda things.

The damage a shotgun does in games is the most important part.
"If it does more damage than any other gun, it doesn't matter if it has no sound effects, you're going to be using it,"
"We start with the gore system, which is a very important ingredient that makes shotguns feel devastating. Second is the impulse force applied to the creatures when they get hit, this is really important to not only make the shotgun feel powerful but also adds to the enjoyment of taking down a target. Third is the damage each pellet does, it's a hard balancing act because depending on what you shot, if it doesn't die or react the way you picture it, everything falls apart and the weapon feels unsatisfying. To balance shotguns in KF2 we first start with the price for the ammo, the weight of the gun and the time it takes to reload. Shotguns generally have massive damage but become less effective at range due to the spread of the pellets which also is a nice tool to balance these high damage weapons.
"Last but not least are the shoot animations. This is an area we've put a lot of time and research in. We animate the shots at high framerate so that we can animate the violent force when you fire a shotgun. This is a detail you barely notice in realtime but can feel the difference."
And when Killing Floor 2 slows down into Zed time, you can really see that animation at work.

Potential themes. Choice, or lack thereof. The banality of evil. A man chooses, a slave obeys. No one thinks himself a villain, and few make decisions they think are wrong. 

Themes of choice in choice oriented games are easy for readers to spot. It would be difficult to convey a lack of free will in a system designed with limited actions.

I could focus on the banality of evil, but to do that, I'd need to discuss our lack of free will. People can do horrible things, but if it were known that we lack freedom of choice, would it affect how we view those very same people? Pity and a desire to help over abhorrence and a desire to lock away or kill.

The region Vivian is traveling to is dangerous. She hired Lorens and Arrisi to protect her. She convinces Gregers to join her with the promise of technology that could help end the war. Josefine joined the team on a whim, and took an interest in Oksidere upon meeting him. The player was designed to communicate in the language of those in the lost cities, and can supposedly interact with most of their technologies using Svalbard databases.

Lance, late-20s, is a young man with a wild and woolly appearance that goes hand-in-hand with his wild and woolly personality. Lance has been selling drugs his entire adult life. Hes never had a day job, never filed a tax return and has never been arrested. He wears a red flannel shirt over a Speed Racer tee-shirt.

Lances rough age.
Hes scruffy, with a possibly ironic pop-culture sensibility.1
Hes a career drug dealer, but unambitious and not traditionally criminal.

If your combat system is only about killing weak enemies while you're a strong protagonist with regenerating health, your gameplay is inherently flawed. By design, the player is never punished for their errors. There are no consequences. Without any consequence there's no tension. Without tension there is no reason to think or care. And worst of all, it's not even empowering.

Doing as you're told isn't always the wrong thing to do, but not thinking for yourself doesn't necessarily lend itself to making the right choices.

A man chooses, a slave obeys.
The banality of evil. "Just obeying orders, following his duty, doing his job."

displayed neither guilt for his actions nor hatred for those trying him, claiming he bore no responsibility because he was simply "doing his job" ("He did his duty...; he not only obeyed orders, he also obeyed the law." p. 135).

Weapon swapping is done with drones. The animations are as quick as traditional weapon swapping with lots of variety.

Cover system that mimics The Division. Use a HUD that floats off of the player character or utilizes the space on their back/shoulders.

-----

Every squad member falls into a class based on the nanites and equipment they use. 

-----

Cover system must be dynamic and use objects other than just waist high walls. The Division is a great example of this mechanic done right.

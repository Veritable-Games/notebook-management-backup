I’ve been given a book of 
we should be able to build more believable worlds for Autumn. see that there are greater habitats beyond the ones that humans have so terribly and uncritically made for themselves
It’s my belief that the places and people we are aren’t something wholly of our own choice. 
It's the people in our lives that should drive us to do, not the earthly things we attain ourselves to.
We stand on the shoulders of giants but do nothing with our time!!!
All of us, and I mean all of us, have the capacity to create.

I’ve felt focused enough to warm the body in expressively violent, candidly violent games. 
the potentiality of;; I do not know how to find the mind’s systemic path’s give us towards our greatest potentiality. 
Be damned the named capabilities of our minds; despite my own faculty deficiencies without games and the more I imagine setting myself to this project the more excited I get to the mind’s practical creative use. 
the people in my life have so much to draw on and it is my great hope that wonderful and so worthwhile friends  give heart to the moments we give ourselves to live.
We should recognize other people and try to give them enough consideration. I’m searching but there still aren’t any characters to see in this world yet. 
If we’re to recognize the player and their needs, we should also consider the needs of the world we’re trying to build. I’m doing so much searching, I have to refocus my attention on the pages to my left. 
so much unsorted. but it’s a feeling I hope any of you reading this can appreciate. 
I've experienced feeling focused enough to warm the body in games that are expressly violent but I’ve known people to be focused enough in genres I’m unfamiliar with. 
To life, there are moments in my greatest focus to a friend's words that they hold me in every detail; the shared conversation, attentive focus that gravitates us toward our greatest capacity; 
Conciliations with the motions of someone talking; such feeling of presence to each other's minds that we will afford each other absolute attention and reconciliation with one another. 
Why haven’t we made games so emotionally holding of us? I believe we need to build our confidence to make Autumn a driver to exercise our dear player's greatest abilities to empathize.

the world we create should afford players moments for self-reflection 
We should set ourselves to design systems that let the player and characters negotiate with one another. Imagine engaging a player in a graduation towards their most empathetic expression with characters. I'm still not done ideating and sufficiently deprived of sleep, but all I can imagine now is that, to do it right, gameplay progression must contest with the will of other people; again, imagining the characters as people to ensure we give them all the necessary considerations.
I’m still searching here because I don’t know how this fits but I’ll keep going…
This is so much fun. Uncertain, but fun.
I should know how to give patience for myself; we should afford players that same time
We must recognize the great potential for good in people but we’re not born giving creatures
Altruism is a learned characteristic
I know I have no power of my own to fix it but through this act of creation I think we can present people with fictionalized opportunities for greater empathy
the works we’re able to make should afford the generations after us meaning where they otherwise don’t find it in their lives. games have the potential to be something so much more profound to us

I think we should exaggerate the biodiversity of the world only slightly. 
I greatly understand the need to consider scope, but a realistic representation would mean so much more to me. I think we’re not seeing the world right. There’s more beyond the rooms and roads we’ve inherited
the world is broken, Autumn can be used to help us reflect on that.
[12:10 AM]Glitch: I think Autumn should only have light appearance changes for sake of scope. 
abilities should allow for multiple solutions to puzzles or scenarios
specialized abilities to advance the objectives

the theme may be that [people only behave as they do]
autumn cannot solve the world's problems by regarding
one person. asking of one person to fix things will not
help. she needs to talk-to and gather many peoples
that would see to these greater problems of everyones

behavior is only predictable by the 'enact' models
never explicitly known to the player unless we reveal
them with the symbols. they happen all the time in
each character's background thoughts. they likewise
have variable reactions depending on the scales of
the conversation Autumn is engaging in. 

each character should have metrics weighed by these
same symbols. if anyone does math we'll need to find
a balance to their distribution and utility in talks. I think
enough variety would mean we have good engagement.

so, this one is uber important to me. but I’d like us to consider having a hub world and imagine a way for it to play a significant role in the story. players ought to feel compelled to return to it and spend time there.
give them a home to feel a connection to; remember our ideas on the floating tree world.

limit the player’s direct control over the world. they can move stuff, not people. people move on their own accord and it’s up to the player to negotiate wants from them.

I'd like to try my hand at animation with some hardware I haven't made much use of. I have a base-station HMD and extra peripherals that’d work well for animation
The setup I have now can track the feet and waist, and I've got an alternative device for tracking your hands. I'm aware the system can handle more for extra detail so I might allow myself the expense 
There’s this dusty tracking peripheral that will let me record natural hand animation that the HMD’s controllers wouldn’t be able to make.
All I have to do is mount the device to get a good view of the hands; thinking on 3d printing
I’m only ideating, but maybe I'll export animations from the vr rig, do almost keyframing to that original recording and go back to add other traits to a character’s movement
check out one by the name of Cascadeur; physically accurate, procedural AI animation
thinking on Havoc for in-world physics but that would definitely mean a paid license so we should asses how important physics would be; I am aware of free alternatives. Unity’s built-in stuff wouldn’t be bad.

all this text really isn’t all that intimidating. It’ll just take some patience to organize
afford players a sense of presence/groundedness unlike anything they’ve ever had in games before
I’m confident these symbols will allow for much greater player expression 
[12:10 AM]Glitch: Here's our shared link for Autum's design bible so far, lots of work to be done. @LittleNorwegians I have to get you invited to the doc so you can see what we're after.  I've done what I can to find a feel for the game. One of the stronger themes that I've written out here goes, "We must recognize the great potential for good in people but we’re not born giving creatures. Altruism it is a learned practice" - and to my immediate attention. "We must give players opportunities to fully consider the people in this world. There are narrative and design affordances we can create to have them consider others; do it right, and they will have no choice but them to reconcile their own wants and needs against the wants and needs of others. – Or to say again in another way, the game only goes on if they continue to negotiate against the wants and needs of other people in the world."
The world we live in is so overwhelmingly broken. We're not seeing it to accurate models in our minds and therefore we cannot fathom the loss of life happening now. Biodiversity is being lost to us and the planet's future hold on life will falter if we're not careful to maintain what we have. The Earth may precede humanity and if so we abuse it to our downfall, it will outlast us still. We've no adequate attention or care to the home we've called our own for 4.5 billion years. The Earthling's children span far removed from Homo sapiens; our form has thrived against the greater will of long-ago forgotten, often unrecognized, and deeply forsaken family. 
Autumn ought to evoke our greatest ability to empathize; invite a player’s most honest presence to the game by showing them paths to reflect on others in the world. To do it as I imagine, we must hold to our minds that the characters we create are literal people, and as such they could reflect on themselves and see wholly of the world we create. I think we must set ourselves apart from the player in much of the design. We should create affordances that would let a player attune themselves to feelings from other people. As a goal for dynamics, we should work to systematically disintegrate the would-be expected absolute will of the player.

Ideated on this bit best I could, but it is not cooked enough, imo. I think I'm on the right track; there is definitely so much more work to be done. I have not ideated proper on mechanics and systems. -- But that said, I have this old, previously designed conversation system I linked for @Anarco (Rorschach) (Rorschach) to try out. It's in our shared Google Doc, but I did not mention it you you yet, @Scuds. I will leave the link to that asset here. My quickest descriptor would be that it's novel ping-pong-like dialogue system that was built to let the player move freely and bounce discussion between multiple conversation partners using symbols to further express themselves.
[12:10 AM]Glitch: LT/RT | LeftMouse/RightMouse to converse. There are a handful of symbols I commissioned to accentuate emotive tones carried in the game I'd be working  on. They had meaning to them, and I can only go and post the old art if you'd like greater sense of the undercooked and untested system. The symbols were fully commissioned work so I've full rights to their use. They are as follows, Pain/ Pleasure, Aggression/Fear, Elation/Misery, Desire/Aversion, Depression/Balance. And there were four more planned that I did not get art done for and will need finished if either of you take an interest in using these for the systems I'm prodding at to exist with all this writing. The four undone are Empathy/Enmity, Pride/Shame. I had imagined them being used in a sentence structure which is why they are linked and repeated in the first image.
I think a lot of what our society is-is reflected in the entertainment we attain ourselves to. Afford the player new ways to interact with characters; build them affordances through sound, animation, and voice, each expression affecting character behavior in discernable ways. I've experienced flow in conversations with friends
we don't have AI to step in for companions yet, I think we ought to build more compelling communication games. combat is much of what we know in the media we invest ourselves in. where so much shared enjoyment comes from. other forms exist and it's so much more than we tend to recognize fighting as it goes for the genre, the games that put as at odds to each other though sport is good fun, colonialism as power in strategy games. Combat and the genres adjacent to it are something universal. I'd like to build  compelling non-combat games that get our most fulfilling engagement; not unlike what we have through real conversations in what the player could potentially express.
[12:11 AM]Glitch: Mechanics:

Theming:
build a world so compelling they can’t help but empathize with the people in it; bring about true feelings of relation
gameplay progression must contest with the will and wants of other people; imagine characters as whole people
design systems that let the player and characters negotiate with one another; against their equal and opposing wants
invite a player’s most honest presence to the game
enable a player to reflect on themselves and truly feel part of the world; let them attune themselves to the people here
we ought to be able to evoke our player’s great ability to empathize
what we make, how we spend our time, the people we spend it with, ought to fill us with an incredible drive to live
if we are full then there is nothing left but to give
The world we live in is so overwhelmingly broken; the many shared experiences by others may give Autumn the wondrous potential to better understand our abilities to relate and find the like-wise determinism in other people. 
We can only show our greatest admiration for the world and do well to imagine those living long after us.

Attention: 
we need to be cognizant of how we ask for the player’s attention; level design aside, 
we should not abuse the player’s attention, don’t ask for time they could not withhold themselves to
afford them respect towards their time; fair save points
player’s shouldn’t feel as if they’re being held hostage by the game
note to devs, play your favorite games and recognize where the game holds your attention, what keeps you playing?

Puzzles:
if a player gets stuck after long enough, afford them light hints towards next steps; and only if they consent to the help
every puzzle has multiple solutions and we should design ways to circumvent them entirely unless critical

People:
design to force the player to reconcile with the fact that there are other people in this world
set them up for opportunities to really see other characters for what they are to themselves
we ought not to regard characters as ‘NPCs’ in how we talk about them being used/seen
we must hold to our minds that the characters we create are literal people
people must come from a shared imagination; as they form, I will need perspectives removed from my own

Player:
give the player enough time to reflect on themselves and the people around them
design well enough, and I believe we’ll be able to create characters so compelling players see them as real people
afford players the ability to ground themselves in the game; draw them into this world, absolutely immerse them, then give them time to find themselves or attention to other things in the world; not solely the objectives we set for them. 
despite the will-be importance, we must try to set ourselves apart from the player in the design process
we should work to systematically disintegrate the would-be will of the player to form different expectations

Exploration: 
secrets, lots and lots of secrets to reward the player for exploration!
design to encourage a sense of discovery and engagement with the world!

[12:50 AM]Glitch: Pitches
Autumn is a narrative adventure & puzzle game with emphasis on mechanic’s design that puts importance on the world’s given characters as much as the player character. 

Use a unique system of expressive symbols dubbed ‘Enacts’ to convey your feelings on events, places, and people in the world. Learn to read and best utilize each of the symbols by interacting with characters and seeing how they respond. 

Progression is marked by resolution of puzzle-like interpersonal scenarios.
Learn to navigate the wide-ranging problems of the world’s inhabitants.

Using ‘enacts’ should convey patterns the player can learn to recognize. Intend to subvert player expectations by giving characters drivers not known to the player; reasons to react differently than may be expected. Characters will be able to drive their own conversations. Difficulty may come from balancing the player’s wants/will with that of the wants/will of these people. 

Exposure to each of the symbols is done gradually, new scenarios will help the player familiarize themselves with each of the symbols. We can prepare them for increasingly complex scenarios and faster engagement as their intuition for the symbols develops. 

We should seek to create a wanting in the player for the time of characters; removed from any puzzles or their gamified drivers, we should design and write to give the player opportunities to see that these characters, these people will also want to spend time for themselves and others. -- The player must likewise be afforded a feeling that they are allowed moments for themselves, too. 

We give the player opportunities to ask of people. People will often ask of the player.  Both the characters and the player can reject said asks. Opportunities to make progression alone exists but may come with greater difficulties.

People can throw a lot at you, and not everyone has the fortitude to give patience; 
Difficulty may come through how taxing a conversation becomes to stay engaged.
Your varied engagement with a conversation will mean alternative character interactions.

Given the full range of expressions, I believe we’ve the opportunity to create some very compelling moments. 
I’m gonna have to give each of the symbols incredible consideration before this really clicks, I think. 

Some short pitches,
Autumn seeks to teach us and prepare us for the tale we’ve to sow ourselves
Autumn is practice on our greatest abilities to empathize and recognize one another
[12:50 AM]Glitch: Let’s say Autumn is someone born with [....]; [...] 

she gives as she may; so do her sister seasons
more that give; as they may, those of great Nature and still, Autumn’s sister seasons. 

Though still, she is so unable to ask of others; so far-removed from the idea of being wanted for- Autumn may only set herself aside in every effort.

Though the sister seasons do so well to find resolution in people’s problems, the forest is seeing a growing neglect. The people content themselves with distractions in isolation from one another. If these so-problems they face are felt in solitude, they-likewise do not know how to ask for help. Autumn does all she may for them in the time Mother Nature sets her to work. So giving in her days- so minded to other people, so happy and content to those that see her from the outside looking in. Autumn does all she may to give recognition to those souls that keep to themselves. 

[There is no draw to an adventure; no compelling movement of the narrative beyond the people of the forest] 
[12:53 AM]Glitch: Player ‘Enact’ Expression Mechanics

This will definitely take time; I’ve yet to spend what’s necessary to describe it. And because of how old the system is; how far removed it is from my mind, I’d have a hard time re-describing what it is and how it’s meant to work.

Features
alternative to traditional dialogue/conversion systems
starting from the initiating interaction from a character/NPC
more opportunities for player expression, save for what’s ‘spoken’
visualized audio files for voice lines
nodes, tangents, 

Symbols for Expression ‘Enacts’

Symbol of Desire: What we want for, the expression that draws us towards people and things in life. Do you want this? Yes.

Examples using the ‘Desire’ enact,
Bear’s made a cake and it looks like a delight. Do you want to say you’d like a piece?

Symbol of Aversion: What we do not want for, the expression that repels us from everything in life. Do you want this? No.

			Examples using the ‘Aversion’ enact,
Use it to reject gifts, reject asks of people, say that you do not want for something.
Someone offers you blueberries, they look like they’ve bruised a few. Do you say no?
A person that’s fond of you expresses an interest in you, but you do not share in it.
Symbol of Elation: The feelings of joy in our lives; an expression for ourselves and for others to say that we like something.

Examples using the ‘Elation’ enact,
You’ve come home after one’s toiling away and family bounds to the door; they greet you with the happiest gesture and a meow. You cannot help but smile and love them.
Knowing you are cared for, that a friend would step in to help. Elated, almost tearful.
A feeling in receiving expressions of love; lighthearted to the self and to so many more.
Smiles live here. In it, find approval of friends and those you harbor great feelings for.

Symbol of Misery: The feelings that afford us feelings of sorrow or faint longing; feelings on bad or ineffectual expression.

Examples using the ‘Misery’ enact,
A person has given you a hard boundary in a relationship; you have feelings of rejection
You feel misunderstood, you spend the rest of the day thinking about what happened
Pain can reflect on misery and likewise misery on pain; the two are anchors for us.

Symbol of Pleasure: Fair appreciation for a feeling, warm, contented. Feelings of being accepted or wanted for; feeling full. 

Examples using the ‘Pleasure’ enact,
A 
You
Someone

Symbol of Pain: An affliction to bring us better experience; reminders of injury to the self or ego. Trauma lives here, too.

Examples using the ‘Pain’ enact,
A
You
Someone

Eight of the twelve named ‘Enacts’: with examples of written ‘spoken’ combined symbols below 
[3:08 AM]Glitch: Of the thing of deterministic strings
We are self-amending; self-forwarding, not self-aware till we've reconciled with (the text going forward). Words do not withhold information unless they're given to function of context. I can say anything if I put myself forward to it; the idea of consciousness is false. We are not built to be self aware, we are built to be self-amending.
[3:32 AM]Glitch:
Contraceptives must be afforded to all whom would want them. 
Male contraceptives are ready; we must allow the faults of the medicine—
men ought share in the responsibility of reproduction in the way of technology. 
Then to 'man's' own calm mind in the acts of great intimacy [people] will partake in. 
The ones without borned systems of bonding as intense as that of a mother

Keeping ourselves isolated to a singular other has reduced our very-human potential for love. We must set ourselves to thinking on the 'plural' will of others.
[4:16 AM]Glitch: removed from ⁠Unknown 

Needs go in abundance. Many things a
person could want for themselves or of
a thing. To say that they would need in
wealth; time, the thing of a future set
for themselves. The idea that we would
need in the moment. To the present will
of things that beset us; not of the small 
but still joyous things- not of gain to our
own accounts or these fun comparisons
to the self and our own ambitions for it.
[4:51 PM]Glitch: exacting writing does no benefit to my description of things
[4:57 PM]Glitch: making up to words without enough context or going to idea 
or saying without direct outlet or goal

to try again at amendment means I've lost heart to the thing I am trying to say
if I am to speak most literally I need to go on to which item brought my relation to it
[from my most-literal experience]
if I have said 'we' in the collective of this terminology; related to the thing of our being human
this thing of family, this thing of long-held ties to our values to one another and society-
people, those others you may see yourself time in: those we may call close to us in knowing
these would have the strongest of descriptors to our language. The ones we could say on and
then say on some more. [I would like to say I had so many such friends; I can still teach. I can 
still write. I can still say on all the things I know. If I am to call you my friend, I must see myself
as one. - The me sucks. The ego really sucks. I hate the thing of 'I' more than anything. Rip that
part of my brain out and give it to someone who wants it. The thing of 'I' again, "I" do not want
my ego. Take it from me and let me give to people. This thing is so absurd. I would want nothing
more than to give myself every effort to fix things but I have no idea where to begin.

My own sin. The thing of we must be collectively amended on and so-thoroughly improved but I
cannot say exactingly on the fixes that would give us most utility. People would like to see credit
I am but a madman. So broken and unrelated to the lot of humanity we've set ourselves 'against'.

To the thing of our forefathers and foremothers. Of all the ways we've come to know ourselves, the
people and all their heart, the life we've so been enabled to. 
[12:23 AM]Glitch: so this text is most definitely useless, I'll post it here for posterity's sake

ref. Dead Space 2023: there was a moment in the game; though I can't remember if this was how it was designed with the first iteration of the title. You are given an ability earlier on, the thing of telekinesis, using this sci-fi psychic power you can pick up objects, throw them.* I've noticed that they may have had to run these through many iterations to get just right.* The thing of picking up a box is learned quickly, you can use it to defend yourself in the combat circumstances in the game.  You may have fun throwing these boxes around and get a good feel for them in a few moments; there comes one, where a doorway prevents your further progression. 

There are two small boxes, each marked with this recurring symbol used to denote an object that would describe it's telekinetic accessibility; you may pick up one of the boxes with your power, knock it around; notice as you throw the thing, your path is obstructed by the bigger box you may have thought would nudge for you. No other such obstacles have been present. You are the fool that walked into a wall. But, the thing of these markings exist and you will see them present on the big box too. Pick up the small box, hit the big box, and there you have a tutorial in its own right. [...] 
[11:59 AM]Glitch: removed from ⁠Unknown 

These writers, they take-away from the beautiful thing of language 
and refrain or neglect to give space for other thoughts; as is this on-
going useless discourse. I do dislike when a writer takes away the 
would-be-weight to something written 

I mean, they write on something and give it fluff; hidden are the 
exacting implications. [what are the strange expectations of saying 
on one's own history or [being so-ignorant] to our full-most wrongs
so, be- onto the imagery to us that does nothing to teach anything?

I have imagined hate on myself; though others will always see 'different'

The bigger theme here is to teach of these things I know by giving NPCs in the game autonomy despite the player's interest. To be 'rejected', 'confused of', 'angered at', 'hated', or 'ignored'. The story of Autumn will take effort to plan right. Violence will have to be repressed through systems of internalized depression. The [hiding away] of someone [these AI] to reflect and return to themselves [and to the world] anew.*

I did a lot of writing and compilation for these tonight. 
[text doesn't look great on mobile]. No doubt I have many revisions to 
make before this stuff is of any realized value to the thing of ⁠Unknown.

Too much of it will need context to make sense for mechanics in the game
I have yet to give this 'dialogue system' and these related symbols use in
the context of gameplay. Writing out these abstractions will only get me
so far in development of this thing. Though I am still so confident in it.

All that aside, these writings [and all my unrelated learnings] will go to 
character writing; this system 'could be' used manually- [or by AI?]

morbidly found there, too
Namely consequent, this thing of our valued masculinity this much deeper systemic thing of misogyny —what men have wrought on the other half of humanity; the unknown internalized violence being so-inflicted. All else enduring; women under the many [wronged] ideals of 'man, he, the husband; the holder of home'. It is so much importance that I do not say on this so directly. I have made this channel private for I am fearful of those consequences of hate. 

The thing of love, I believe; or the value to say we are only to love one other; though admirable, and shared-joyously in best intent, one much truly share so much of themselves to a singular one person; I think [his] expectation for a singular other is so-said to be [poor]. Much in the way of culture, I mean most-literally; men deserve to give [greatest regard] for women in the way of childcare: to set another apart in total dependence is what the expectation of marriage is doing to us.

mortified by this one, too
The incredible ideas on the life we have so-seen ourselves to. We have not been-so ordained
our novelties as bipedal 'great' apes that see to everything they could have for; then to more.
These inherited drivers have not given us best need to people; instead they've held us to ideas of
wealth- to have Fortune ordained unto our inheritors, to see ourselves apart from the whole in
this thing of 'Nature' and these drivers for what 'we ought to have'; great consequence to cars
and all related systems of 'growth'; to the scars of highways- so far and wide parking lots, 
then to skyscrapers to house these things- miles- untold acres reaped from the earth in our
need for so much abundance. All consequence [from] our economic-drivers of growth and
all these inherited organizations that would keep production of what we would need and not.

Why do we enjoy games? 
What are the literal attributions of behavior that keep us so-engaged? 
Games are good for us; great even- but: "Where does our joy come from?" 
Or, "What keeps us occupied from moment to moment as we play  them?"
 
[2:59 PM]Glitch: removed from ⁠Unknown ||The thing here is contentious, 
[-] I believe that the thing of such [severe] bondage to [a] single-
other soul; though I so-see that so many would find themselves 
in such severe of heart. My own take here is that we have let our
-selves be confused of the mind's potential for this thing of vari-
egated want for another. The thing of distance in separation. 
[8:23 PM]Glitch: I couldn't put functional language to it but I don't think we've got a good model of the universe. They say the universe is expanding but it's curved? We have all these weird visual models; none of them so maintain our understanding of general physics. The images are reflected on our understanding of math. Our mathematical models are incomplete. We do not have a theory of everything or the universe as is. If we asked a computer how to replicate the thing from scratch, we couldn't say how to do it. Everything is systemic in the way of determinism. I don't think any of the models I've been exposed to hold up to the real thing. If there was a great expansion, it didn't curve into a disc or a cone or a a twisted ring of sorts. If this lines up with any of our grounded-to the world models. The universe is a sphere, we may not be looking at the center; but the 'greater star' of one its surface entities. If the universe is not expanding, but accelerating these immense; distances of space between pockets of dense matter; clouds, gases, immense stars so variegated in scale, the distance among each of them so immense. We see buck a sliver of the surface of the galaxy's sky. And I do not believe we would be able to see its center. Our fact of birth as a galaxy means we are rushing away from whatever this pocket of matter was, in all directions- like the stars, floating in a much larger vacuum of everything. We cannot see it we cannot see the edge of the universe because light may not travel forever indefinitely. We are speeding apart from the 'great expansion' big bang, tiny pocket of matter in this bigger universe.
[8:32 PM]Glitch: We are on a surface of an invisible density of unseen matter; on bigger 'big bangs' the rushing away effect may be that light cannot go forever. We may not see other galaxies come into our horizon; not until our models are far more complete. We will see more patterns  emerge when we observe further and for much longer spans of time. There may be no telling indefinitely or unless our mathematical concepts find us at a true theory of everything.

How does it follow that this thing that is not like the universe we know but, also- and not like the universe we know. These models I've seen get so very warped; it's almost like the caricatures you'd see medieval artists paint of the creatures they had described to them. Our star was not the beginning of all things. We are we  small pocket of matter across this 'horizon' of the universe. If the universe is the curved surface of the earth's oceans, we can only see so far around us in every direction. Light cannot reach the greatest depths of the ocean, how are we to suppose it goes out forever into the darkest unknowns of the universe? Light cannot carry forever. We're only seeing the glimmer of a glimpse of the universe and all its wonders. 

We are seeing curved space because it is in fact a curve. We are a tiny light among a pocket of floating space. Our technology cannot see far out enough yet but we will find one day that there are other galaxies rushing toward us. 

So much variety as we are flung further out that we would not recognize that the universe was once thought to be dying. Entropy goes on, but matter cannot be created or destroyed. The matter does not go to oblivion, but go out against the gravity of space and these other unknown forces that hold us apart. If we are on the surface of the universe rather than the 'birthed from the center of it'; we may see that time will go on indefinitely. Humanity's nascencey does not see the 'edge' of what is not visible to us. Light may not travel so far indefinitely. 

Radio disperses; other matter slows in comparison. We have not measured such distance time that light may slow. How are you to say that a photon lasts forever? Do they run out of mass as the atoms spin on for untold epochs of time? We are not losing the universe, we are blinded by its holdings of physics and our limited perspective on these galactic shores.

removed text
I have crazy ideas for different types of gameplay loops for character-centric dialogue that may hold people's attention 'active', sensations [or real, if OpenAI would be seen workable] rehetorical conversations; this imagination of good conversations with characters that may so-better retain the present-mind of someone playing. [I love good, detailed text boxes; but dialogue bubbes are still not very interesting, take too many expected keys- and still may not keep someone's future interest should they return. 

I have crazy ideas but I promise so many of them go with grounding. (No one to help me ideate further or iterate on this old dialogue system I commissioned).

Player expectations are the most interesting thing to me. And I have a much larger idea on how I might go to use it in games; work's been done by a programmer I commissioned and had contracted 

Many, many more ideas on things in life. All of my work will tie to these themes in my world-building and then design if I should so be afforded opportunities by people. These things may take years to do on my own; or I could make some really good dev friends by helping with their problems.
 
[8:54 PM]Glitch: I have so much sin to work on, so many more efforts to improve myself be for I may do such a thing as apply for Valve; tomorrow 
I am to give out my best value to people. Recognize them, see other people as best you may; give yourself unto the text and this thing 
of rhetoric; soliloquy, speak to them- not to your own. Gain attention of one and say on more things. See that all people would like 
recognition and give unto your best effort so [your time isn't wasted]. I feel, I feel without purpose if I do not see myself to mind of 
other people. Others are still so distance; but it's not myself I want to reconcile on it's these greater ideas on what people can mean 
themselves to be; the ways our values are inherited to things of nurture:nature; these much physical knowings of what we are in 
DNA;RNA, epigenetics: the thing that reflects from behavior to modify [these things of internal and social balance]; , 

We tie ourselves to people in the way of what I'm trying to figure on with the 'enacts'; greater to games, not so literal to life- 
but we may create a thing that is done with design to best help people. The thing of systems of beneficence- is that systems
is almost redundant. I have a bad memory correlator with the name. Strong title, no substance. I do not explain myself well enough
to people. There are better affordances to what may constitute as things, we could not give 'casual attribution to' in way of this word
the name- you might not erase it. But set something else as an epistle to reconcile these not fully rhetorized misgivings. If I have so
much to give back it is to people and what I have not given well enough to them. This thing of sin goes on and I cannot amend if I do not
ask for return. - This thing of language goes on and my knowledge does not stay held to the people in my life. This thing of giving will go
on, and on and on to people that may see 'good reason' to it. 

The thing of life goes on and Omari, proposing to "kick my ass" through the walls like that was not a good idea. If you have any good rec-
ognition would would amend this bad behavior. You declared you would not like to talk to me. I did not think  on giving my full saying; the 
attribution of something so difficult to parse was so-said. The thing of 'we' is so difficult. You may say 'we' as a team. You may say we as 
brothers, sisters; mothers, fathers- family and friends. To all those still others we would call close. You may only say 'We' as people in 
context to all others. I cannot reason 'we' to people you may so call 'friends' in life. 

This thing of giving is so difficult. I must find reason to give for everyone's sake, not my own in these moments of writing. I have so strange
goals to work for. Life goes on and I can only move myself forward to the text as I may. These works are meant to help people in a much
larger context and I have no best working-hypothesis; though I so-believe through language you may come to proofs of our values. The
thing of knowledge is interesting, in that; ways we talk to people give personal ideation to what's said [exactingly so]. Language comes
a sort of recognition in other people. The thing of live is that we have unseen relational distances. I may care as I do. I may care as I so
hope to. My givings are not good enough. My behavior is not amended enough. I have far-too much to learn before this thing of so-called
ignorance is the furthest idea from my mind; I so-believe we can better ourselves. I cannot rightly say how in one brief message to myself.
[9:31 PM]Glitch: from ⁠Unknown, fluff to be thrown away
If I have proof in my abilities to writing; this would be it. 
To the thing of soliloquy, language, rhetoric. Of best to
my storytelling (scripting?)  so far. This great telling of 
a thing I think we all well-know in inheritance to life. 

I have tried in so many in fragmented ways though my own [poor]
understanding still goes on to develop: my own ignorance
will only have the thing of further improvement. Language
is so important and we may have incredible abilities in our
best utility of it.

This may not follow well enough yet. I need more people to share their experiences on it, and maybe find supporting evidence through research citations. I do not know how this repression plays out in the mind of those that are affected by migraines. And there may be more to the physical causes attributed to them. I think it'll take more to say with absolute certainty that there are causal connections to our withholdings of the self; maybe to some incredible degree if those pains are so severe.

If you could say that machine learning is not discernible to any-given soul. That the art we're able to produce ourselves is likewise not separable from what we've had influence from. That our works are acts of creation standing among other so giants of art. This false-child of ours, the AI learns from literal form and is unavoidably disrelational to what it knows.

These companies may not even see how 63% of Americans live their lives paycheck to paycheck. So-be the artists are deserving of this work. Any profits made by this company are well-deserved to all the artists of the internet and well-past it.

I want to see a games project. But  it  is  so  difficult to find someone's attention to work they

only work towards more clarity for this insane thing of references that go all the way over

This text could go on. Hello, all. Again. I do not mean to overwhelm. "Here are more paragraphs."  I see now that the thing of 'I' doesn't have to be so toxic, I've recently found. I can be okay to share myself.

These misunderstandings; not knowings of
my behavior, make me so forever frustrated. I so vehemently dislike texting, and all the consequences that go to missing context or misholdings of someone's theory of mind. It is 
absurd that we convey ourselves this way. I would love to never text again but it remains that this is our only option for a great distance of communication. Why is it that people remove themselves from understanding so quickly???

In my terms,
"The universe more aptly verse-because we do not see all of the other tiny big bangs is curved, but most literally spherical over incredible distances we could not exactingly comprehend. It's my working hypothesis that the thing of light does not go on forever; the ocean's depths are said to 'absorb' or scatter wavelengths, but there is such an abundance of light that if that were true the earths waters would glow bright. Light bounces reflects, 'gets absorbed' ended or reattributed to our eyes. We do not see the death of light in our lives. But as all things in wavelengths; even radio signals, light dies; so thus its not the end of the universe we're seeing or the 'forever losing of everything'; it's just that distances go on beyond the capacities of light to reach us. Light cannot go forever. This model of the universe is exactingly related to this model of the whole 'verse' not being readily visible to us; but present nonetheless."

We are on a surface of an invisible density of unseen matter; on bigger 'big bangs' the rushing away effect may be that light cannot go forever. We may not see other galaxies come into our horizon; not until our models are far more complete. We will see more patterns  emerge when we observe further and for much longer spans of time. There may be no telling indefinitely or unless our mathematical concepts find us at a true theory of everything.

How does it follow that this thing that is not like the universe we know but, also- and not like the universe we know. These models I've seen get so very warped; it's almost like the caricatures you'd see medieval artists paint of the creatures they had described to them. Our star was not the beginning of all things. We are we  small pocket of matter across this 'horizon' of the universe. If the universe is the curved surface of the earth's oceans, we can only see so far around us in every direction. Light cannot reach the greatest depths of the ocean, how are we to suppose it goes out forever into the darkest unknowns of the universe? Light cannot carry forever. We're only seeing the glimmer of a glimpse of the universe and all its wonders.

When the player attains all the designed mechanics for the game, they change form into this thing of an 'Edict'; a metal-material 'species' discovered on Grand Voss. "When the player finds everything they need, their body morphs into something else. The parts they have collected over the course of the game and the literal machinations fall away; the abilities that they’ve collected remain, each of which is given a significant boost in speed and no-so severe requisite needs for resources to make repairs, give social assistance, or physically 'rest' in way of heat dispersal." The player would lose the need of a work bench and would not need to cool themselves off in sources of water to prevent being disabled. 

"Heat management as engagement; variability and skill to avoid the threshold limits" Modular character controller. Components should add visceral new feelings to the gameplay. Running should feel weighted and mildly impactful. Alter pieces that change how the player moves; swapping bipedal legs for a wheel to gain mobility or treads for better utility on snowy or uneven terrain. Upgrades have a mechanical impact on the player, but each are represented physically. Head, torso, legs, and various cosmetic areas like shoulders or belt.” This original body is a slow, cumbersome form but players should have the expectation that 'upgrades for mobility are on the way'. When really the game is meant to be engaging at the pace we've designed for. 

In the story sense though, the machine the player occupies has operated between owners for centuries now 'Heat' is added to the player's total quantity when they perform an action of physical movement. But there is also a 'social threshold of heat' people may only return so much and the player may only give out as much as they see themselves to. 

During gameplay movement is akin to limits of stamina in other games; players are intended; given affordances, to always on the lookout for sources of water. Ponds, streams, falls, puddles, rain, lakes. Lots of water to bring the game strong themes related to Nature and give the systemic-engagement to this thing 'connections' to the world which hold mechanical purpose."

Design player movement mechanics around good engagement in the 'heat' mechanic; give form in good architecture and spacial design. community gardens with an emphasis on sharing the wealth and eliminating local food waste; garden plots or rooftop greenhouses could 're-hydrate' the food desert. 

Though, I do wonder if crops are a greater means of water retention that lawns. empty grasses in areas without native capacity to maintain the species' homeostasis, are wasteful. We should encourage and illuminate local property owners on these practices and establish routes for yield donations. strengthen nutrition of cities by avoiding the need for frozen goods and the nutritional losses the practice comes with. Source locally! (These ideals are what I want to write into the game description)
[2:14 PM]Glitch:
The Edict: Creatures born on Grand Voss from seemingly inorganic debris arrange themselves into a web of adaptive fauna around the Atlas Tethers. Altering their shape, behavior, and metabolism to suit the gradient of habit beneath each structure. They are almost crystalline, abstract in shape but still maintain flexibility and functional form to the landscape of these incredible megastructure. Edict are the native species of Grand Voss, wiry crystalline machines that’ve evolved to thrive all over the planet; taking shapes optimized for their environments. 

Extremophiles that build up heat energy that inhibits movement after a time. Edict can vent heat by resting and let it gradually dissipate, or they can expel the heat energy quickly by contacting water. Extreme heat build-up may vaporize the water source on contact. The water will usually refill given the source is active. Would you please imagine an appearance of this machine character? 

The player character. It's original form in the literal thing of a robot, then the appearance they may take in the mention of these 'Edict' creatures. When the player is removed of their old form and given improvements in shape of the native species of Grand Voss, the player can travel greater distance with the right input and positioning. The rolling jump is greatly improved. 

All mechanics are just 'boosted'. They may find they can now 'bounce' off of walls and floors for momentum (instead of destroying them like would-happen before in their; clunky, cumbersome form. And now able to roll at accelerating speed limited by the now greater heat threshold) 

Time a jump right and the player can span distances over levels that would not be otherwise available for them to access. Legend of the edict "Builder-type Edict that don't have much of a personality. They'll wander around helping humans with construction work, limit potential hazards, and catch anyone that might fall off these megastructures; (including the player) though human technology would protect us. 

They may often interfere before conflict arises (wildly- as if they may hear greater things of war in our language) and can often dissuade people from fighting by talking in the same way the player does. The Edict are a mostly inactive (and 'uncommunicative') population of AEI. The player is one of them without realizing it. Edict are born from the dodecahedron (dodec) 

They would not be able to share explicit memory of how the Atlas Tethers were constructed and what purpose the world rings and their engines do suppose. People believe that within in them lie the meaning behind everything that is happening in their visible milky way. -- 

But as the stars go dim, greater use of technology reveals stars that were otherwise obscure or 'blinded' by 'noise' in our way. The muting of our home system and subsequent stars means we can see further into our given universe. The stars are being preserved by way of star-lifting and dyson swarms; retaining all energy in wasted expulsion of a star for these vast distances of time yet seen to us. 

(the active Edict are newly born, newly exposed to the world; they know nothing of their past civilization; but there are hints of these histories found in literary works related to the Enacts) Enacts were a language given to the Starbound who landed on Grand Voss. 

Ways of language almost unrecognized at first that is now shared communally in way of the literal dialogue system. still too much information to parse, sorry. will keep adding to this
[3:09 PM]Glitch: The Starbound have made tremendous effort to preserve their generation ships. The vessels shelter and preserve trillions of lives; many seek to make the Geis solar system, to Grand Voss, their seen-eventual home. The given home of those born on the ships do not yearn for Earth, they may see it in the great histories we carry with us, but we may only look to the future. So this one-day arrived almost deified thing of a planet so far from us. 

Travelers would spend untold lifetimes, imagining the decidedly unnamed super-Earth with her trio of moons. So-named Grand Voss, then Chione, the world is named in recognition of the named goddess; daughter of Arcturus & 'incidentally' taken by the father, Boreas. The third moon named, relational-recognition of the Naidad, Dionysus. 

To give history of things we would name our ties to history and astronomy, and our telling of tales and naming of characters; then ourselves and these . To iterate, the trio of moons are named Arcturus, Boreas; thus Dionysus. All writing in naming them related to Greek mythology as it reads from my sourcing.

People (the starbound) are so-sheltered by gravitationally bound 'generation' ships. Each of the ships will enable life for untold thousands of years. They have sent forward probes to the trajectory-bound system that are gathering resources for pickup as they go to slingshot to the next system. Returning probes will bring this whole-but part of humaThe earth is left with no debts. They have no needs to fulfill for earth; the re workings of what we have made for ourselves are so good for another that this thing of traveling into the stars goes in nigh mundanity.

To the Starbound’s discovery, this world had been architected long ago. Grand Voss has technology visible to the naked eye- enormous megastructures, rings lined with ‘engines’ that wrap the world.

These Starbound colony ships (generation ships) Are ancient vessel built to face the eons ahead. The repair abilities afforded to the player are not novelties of technology; but with
an abundance goes continued building and may be neglect as people reserve themselves to fall into digital sleep. New life is born, people may remain in the world forever, but the people of Grand Voss are physically sparse in their daily lives. The planet of Grand Voss and the moon of Chione were mapped ahead of time by wafer sats designed by the Starbound. They’re sent in advance and can make full 3d maps of destined bodies. 

People received photographs of their new home hundreds of years before they’d reach it. To their awe, this world has since been built-on, but there are no signs of biological life. The wafer sats are also capable of sending ‘building probes’ that would begin to give us autonomy of what we build for eons before our eventual arrival. 

But, the images, recordings, and renderings revealed that the super-Earth wore two immense rings along her axis, each supported by an array of sixteen Atlas Tethers; incredible, towered structures with braces that served as secondary habitats. Sturdy, ringed structures encapsulated in the falls

Life-extension technology has allowed the most optimistic of the vessel’s crew to tell stories of home we left behind. Sol is only known to them through the ships’ Endeavor’s shared archives and through stories shared by its long-lived forward-bound crew. Stories archived tell of a life lived beneath the bright, blue sky of a sky so once unknown to the Starbound. the colony ships destined home instills great hope in the people.

Fewer still made the wager to establish settlements before they arrive, riding shortly behind the path of research wafers that delivered the first photographs of the super-Earth and the megastructures she donned.

In several hundred-thousand years’ time, the carried an untold number of souls between stars over the span of several hundred thousand years. By third generation landed, the colonists had collected an abundance of confidence in their eons-old slingshot-ship and the technology she carried. 

At present, the emboldened, six-times-slingshotted generation ship is set to take foot on Grand Voss; and may be her moon of Chione, with still-working advancements in technology and creative soul. They all see the advantage of human settlements being built centuries earlier; maintained by versatile, satellite-built machines. But there is an argument to be had in those that would ‘see ownership’ of the desolate space before. Maybe contest their presence, but what choice do they have? To remain aloft in space for untold time forever? We need a home in a planet, people say.

The extraordinary starships they occupy carries an untold number of generations between stars; built to slingshot itself and the smaller bodies locked in gravitational transit. 

Due to life-extension technology many of the original crew, Grand Voss will be a blessing to finally see ourselves to. (If we so may be allowed to it) Still others felt their true home lay further out into the Milky Way. 

But in all, these vessels served as an unwitting home destined to take them into forever and beyond, passenger willing. 

Could you imagine what they would write about and ‘actively’ design for Grand Voss, so- waiting; decades, centuries, millennia, untold thousands of year; just to receive imagery from the forward-bound probes. And then, still having to wait eons more to reach it in physical presence. Humanity will amass stories of an unknown alien civilizations and the awesome engineering capabilities they posed in building these super-structures. What might they imagine its meant to be? What can they hope to do when they arrive? There is no changing course. Would you write me a journey entry on their feelings of it?
[3:13 PM]Glitch: Now they’ve arrived and spent centuries beneath the blue sky. (now darkening night sky); but those that in the digital spaces that see awareness of what’s happening on the outside may not act on seeing understanding of it. They are complacent. People in the literal external world see these problems; still cannot fix them, but are seeking good recognition to reconcile what’s happening. Maybe it’s connected to the megastructure? Why does this thing give us so much life? Why are the waters so pure? Why does it give so much energy in way of heat and way of protection in this advanced retention of atmosphere?

I’ve not made sufficient mention of it. But the metamaterial of these fictional structures is best called ‘icor’, I think. The fictional material is mined for its ease of shaping through ‘pressure’ and has better construction and weight-bearing abilities than any other ‘readily’ known compound. It is mined [...] Grand Voss is absolutely immense; reaping from the earth had been recognized by those old; far-off lives of humanity 500,000 years ago traveled. We would not reap from this thing of our new home; the incredible super-earth and her quadruple, related moons. TO BEST AMEND. CHIONE is the name of the super-earth these old travelers, the Starbound have set themselves on. The quad moons, named as mentioned by the trio. But a fourth, the fourth is given the name of 'Grand Voss'. For I do not see our thing of 'rightedness' remaining when we come upon fascinations of built-things beyond our minded comprehension. We would have no privilege to the world and thus not 'mine' a meta material from it. But for plot, and reason of Edicts and the player character. Built structures would scaffold off the atlas tethers. We would not set surface to the world below because of the incredible turmoil of oceans and would-be storms set above the oceans. Great depths of this super-earth nothing we build could withstand the density of. Oceans to deep that if you were to sink; sink to the very depths and be crushed. iterative pull. May be recognition that things are not to be destroyed. The thing of the oceans would let you sink 'forever'. These structures are meant to enable life; but this meaning is not greatly seen to people that would so arrive here. (on Chione). This is a hidden thing, but you may spoil it; just be careful how its presented. Good impact in the writing will be most useful to me. Great engagement to bring people let me pitch the game to people who may want to help.

The colony ship (all are named 'Starbound') Who would so name themselves the thing of 'grounded' if this is the termed moniker to the name as these traveled people. If this was your history; you would want so-the-name. The generation ship is long gone. Those on Chione, (the quadruple, I suppose; please amend that) Would you please help me consolidate this?

The crew of the generation ship has arrived at Grand Voss after centuries of waiting and imagining what it might be like. The journey has been long and filled with uncertainty, but the hope of finally finding a home has kept them going. The crew has been fascinated by the unknown alien civilizations and the engineering marvels that have been found on the super-Earth. However, as they settle in, they are faced with new challenges and questions. The blue sky has darkened and the once pure waters are showing signs of strain. The megastructure that gave them so much life and energy is now causing problems that they are struggling to understand and fix. Despite these difficulties, the people are determined to make the best of their new home and find a way to reconcile the problems they face. They are seeking recognition and understanding of what is happening, hoping that it is somehow connected to the megastructure and its advanced technology.

Entropy goes on. We will have to make due with our own sun. Maybe one day preserve other stars with incredible dyson swarms set out by wafer sats; all to remove mass from the stars to expend their lives indefinitely; transfer mass into easily-transferrable matter- better, incredible stores of hydrogen and all those others materials extracted. Create ringed-world engines that will take planets in same-relative distance from the sun to maintain their solar input; irregardless of the prospect of life or not. Be sure that every planetary body holds form. Each planet is to have an asteroid deflection system. This stuff is background knowledge but it's not important I will have to keep this in reserve instead.

I need to keep emotional weight to this text.

No time, just incredible-vast space. The thing of the universe is not expanding from the mere big bang; we're only seeing but one act of entropy among this larger mass-sphere. There are untold imaginings of big bangs all over this sphere of the verse not seen to us and will never be seen to us. But recognized in mathematics and these oddities of matter we cannot be helped to understand. The verse is not a 'disc' like our galaxies give assumption to, just a sphere. 

course the image [from the links] is crazy scale we couldn't comprehend. that model is so funny to look at. putting an image to it sucks

the thing of these unseen variables are maybe just small flitters of this thing so far removed from the surface of the thing we would term a 'uni' verse. Why is the assumption one? Like a constellation that could not even see light to each other maybe. 

Light does not reach the surface of our deepest oceans. Light holds energy we may utilize. Why is the assumption that it 'flitters out' or gets bounced so much? Volume of light does not change, but mass can prevent it from moving through. It is still bounced or reflected. Matter may be acted 'on' but it in the way of color against the background of our eyes to make sense of patterns. 

The thing of light runs down. That's not the 'edge' of the universe running away from us; that's the distance of light that dissipates. We may reach as far as we can try. But light has an end?

As radio signals, all other lave lengths. (What the heck are the tinier molecules in relation to gravity; those smaller bits of matter that give operation of chemistry?)

light may only travel to us so far, it runs down like any other wavelength
we are not forever lost to the universe we are just forever blind to it.

'We' will lose nothing but the entropy of our sun; 'practical distance'  and velocity 
to reach things as they accelerate from this 'small-center' of our infinitesimally tiny pocket on this 'surface' of the space's 'ocean' we should just call the verse". 

We will one day lose practical distance to all other bodies connected from this tiny bang.
over these untold trillions of years- may encounter more likelihoods as that thing so incredible as Andromeda. Or may be all these bursts of 
entropy from this larger thing over the verse set everything, just erupt out in big bangs as time goes on

our time models are right, the relational distance in start of light the (tiny) big bag

[6:58 PM]Glitch: my original description for one of the ⁠Unknown, Want-

To 'want-so' to 'say-so'; behavior to act, to feel, 
to see that you 'have'; unto the wants of things 
and the wants unto yourself and still to others.

To granularly feel unto the act; to see that we 
forward ourselves to these things of inherited 
behavior; if I am to want on someone I would 
say unto them what I would need of them. 

If 'I' am to say on what I would 'desire' of someone, 
it is to hold unto the recognition of this thing of 
relational need we would explain by the same name. 
To give weight to what we see that we need; give 
ourselves to say-so; action in things of trust.

What is [our] want for the 'I'?
Why do we desire for things of
thirst, hunger, sleep, and love?
Want, desire, need, & to crave.
The thing of 'I' which goes on.
to amend, to correct, to reflect.

To say for ourselves and other people 
that we would want for something is 
to 'set-ourselves-forth' on on these 
physical, then chemical; neurological, 
then-social drivers that hold [us] to 
one another.

Knowing what one may want,

Of wanting on things. If we have all 
we have need of we would not want. 
"If I have my given; belly full, warmest 
hearth, life to live; I only have myself
to give for all those other souls. 

If it relates to the thing of beneficence, these 
drivers to want for oneself, reflected on others; 
we should believe people have shared systems 
of beneficial affordances in the way of values.

These things we would set ourselves to each day between 
others; related to our most held, internalized systems of 
self-value, then forward related to those whom we hold.

To say unto our deepest desire to the will of our own; 
warmest to others who may share in our time; though-
imagined are our best impressions of who they so-are. 

Want is not truly known to another unless the thing is 
said or greatly expressed; rejected if then, too. Theory 
of mind is a terrible expectation: no one may see you
in your 'upmost' entirety. Your mind is forever yours.

Related to history

The saying that we have ourselves 
a "theory of mind", when we hold 
so many others close is not as true 
as our ancestors would have once 
experienced: the thing of knowing 
oneself; then to the other people 
we would see ourselves to-

If no one will hate me, I must do it to myself. I have criticisms 
to how I write sometimes and if I cannot think how to amend 
them in the moment, maybe I'll make reference them here. 

Very often I will write nothing. Substance is all there is to what 
comes out of words and this [thing], of my saying on saying; is 
not giving you anything to think [on]. 

[...]

Of shame and hiding oneself. [The resolve to keep from 
others your illunderstood will]. To the values we hold to 
ourselves in comparison to others. On our vices, the mu-
ltitudes of ways we might take of [time] for ourselves; to 
avoid the may-be attention of others so that we would 
maintain our own [independent] wills.

Why does shame make us want to hide ourselves?
Why does depression bring us to isolation?
Why do [these drivers] push us to solitude?
How do [our feelings] of 'not being wanted' [pull/take] us away? 
Why do we 'seek-out' for corrections in our behavior; 
Why do we see to it that others hold our best intention?

Why [do we not] imagine that they likewise have their own [felt-best] intentions?
Why do we desire to be seen as good; to be valued in [them], despite ourselves?

Why do we align ourselves to these shared values? 
Why must we amend ourselves to uphold these ideals? 
Why does distance give variegated feelings of rejection?

It's just our deterministic behavior, but how are we driven so far apart and so close?

Enact of Elation: [call it joy, discovery; ties to 'happy-surprise' & expressed graciation: in extreme, to variegated love]

I think you'd see it as 'excitement' or felt internally as 'joy', 'warmth', greater, to 'love'
in variegated ways. may-be the greater ties without our [most good] thing of surprise

On what I know to the behaviors of giving; and thus [wanting] rejection or separation from one other. There is extreme irony in this thing of hiding the thing of giving; but I cannot rightly express the thing without feeling I may be seen as overly knowing to what I would do; then to neglect of others I would only want to love all the more. This is, crazy, that I've hidden the thing of love and the thing of giving. But they're so important to our behavior that I cannot afford to not amend these texts to our best recognition. —

Call it return on someone's sight of want

I'm having odd misgivings about this book I'm gathering references on; though there are a many abundance of truths—and the work has been so terribly important for my understanding of this topic of want. I am-so for the insights; known now only to my own consequence. 

[...]

Those that do not see how to love another and still those more that may find themselves to be weary or seeing that there is another that would surpass them in [given] needs.

Needs go in complexity. What does one still go on to need for? If all needs; the ones of your income, your [wanted time to the self]; of all the work you could have done or all the things you keep on doing. If we have our complexities aside, and all our abstracted needs are met to ourselves then I think all that follows is that we either have nothing- or we have other people.

for ⁠Unknown this thing of greater 'love' in elation will not be explicit to the player

elation may tie strongly to greed; ‘wanting’; these of our most selfish drivers endure to affect us; amend that which goes on to relate ourselves to others,

Surprise 'in-elation' is anticipation that [does not] fail us.

Elation (in extreme) goes in the way of laughter, smiles; warmth, joy, jeers, and love 'elation' may tie strongly to greed; ‘wanting’; these of our most selfish drivers

Wants to 'elation' endure to affect us in ways that you may attribute to addiction

what are this game's themes, what is the dialogue system meant to do for the player?

The idea behind the conversation system (using enacts) is to create a conversation system that engages the player and offers a platform for good discourse and effective communication. To achieve this we need consider the emotional ties that players have with the characters, and use the narrative to keep the players focused on the game. Built-well, the dialogue system would take into account the player's level of boredom and adjust the conversation accordingly. — A high level of boredom means that the character would talk to the player automatically, while a low level of boredom means that the character may disengage with the conversation. The goal is to create a narrative that keeps the players centered in the experience, with strong emotional ties to the characters, which in turn would keep [their own] attention. The idea is to have a dialogue system that is more engaging, and that utilizes good writing to keep the players interested.


We have a have a responsibility to anyone we would see ourselves to relationships with. responsibilities to our parents, to our children, to work and may-be study. The acts of creation go with oneself; or ideals that one would work with others. we have this thing of so responsibility for those here. and those will-be ones far off and so close to the present day. 


these systems are discernable as still so many others. 

We see another as so important but then we see that they are we need. Systems above us have been set to keep us from the thing of reliance in a community.

What are the enacts?
These symbols, the things of 'enacts' are meant to give me a better understanding of] [what we are] as these weird, bipedal; chemically-driven machines of water and bone; to see other people; to truly recognize the others 'will'.

[An 'enact' should not have an explicit description in a single word: but we will need single words for their best-given utility] 

Fables should teach on good communities and willful people. 

To teach, they can only learn from others; to know boundaries, feel on those wills of good expectations and granted understandings of the world. If we greatly know each other, it's through these strange, inherited affects of language. Value: "you do not know me; but I would  like to se myself to so much of my own willed intent to do good for the world". To teach we would know ourselves and see the greater needs of our betters; much apart from these greater expectations of what society wants of us- for each other to sustain, not for growth of our best accounts. Of rebellion to the freedom of knowledge and libraries.

The thing of fear is that it should not be used. It is, as reads. To impose one's authority over another. If we see over ourselves those others that hold power. 
They are inciting the thing of fear. If we see that our lives are ruled by a thing that we may not have; the thing of fear endures. "If life would go on, as life will persist
if all that there is, all that exists; the furthest from we, the furthest from this. Of all those things that would rather be missed-" fear has endured: it has remained.

Call it 'cause' fear be fast negation of cause. 

The concept of fear is one that is used as a means of control and domination over others. People in positions of power often instill fear in those around them to maintain their authority. Fear can lead to negative consequences such as anxiety and can be seen as a hindrance to progress and personal growth. Fear is often rooted in a lack of control or understanding over a situation, and its persistence can lead to feelings of helplessness and a cycle of negative thoughts and emotions.

Our internalized fear in imagination compounds much greater there than for comparison to the things in reality that would absolutely damage to us. 

Uncertainty is a thing of fear and we have all but inherited a give recognition of it. The thing of fear does not go away we may only better see it. 

People should be afforded given certainties in life-

We must bring our fellows out of fear; see them to the best affordances to life. Without fear we may only return ourselves to others. Without fear we may do as we so need to. Do so as we may. To our best wills and best futures. 

Humanity must escape itself from the notion of fear under rule-

People are to decide our future, not so the economy and greater systems of organization that have set themselves above us. 

We live in ways of fear of how we might stand up to the comparison of society. In ways of fear that would set us against our best use of time. Going against the things of reflection, talk, play, work, and good labor. Fear must be recognized and seen reconciled otherwise it will continue to hold over us. I've only just started listening to his full text here, but it's good stuff.

may be more ambitious; procedural, physics-based animations
with these expressive systems to-boot. give the system AI?

abstractions of this system
The bigger theory need only be applied to the game through systems of 'values' reflected by characters back onto the player and to amend forward; negotiate in conversation, (to put purpose to words and say your own unto the will of others) as you would in real life. These 'AI' may have wills unseen to the player even if we give the dialogue mechanics [related to NPCs] hidden weighted values."

The player would work-to [sometimes, in-contention]; for the best outcome in these value systems. 'Say-so' and they may hear on your will, listen; and you may hear on theirs. We can't write forever, [these] dialogue [systems] must come to an end between objectives; but these hidden systems will make characters [outwardly] 'independent' and believable to the player. The values; if enough complexity arises (not just between a character and the player) between two or more of these AI, they may be able to negotiate their 'own' outcomes despite the player.

The things of fear, sadness and love. Are difficult things to design for; severely so. But they would have to be nonetheless. If this game is enabled to relate enough to people. Each goes to rejection in a similar way. Returning to the idea of depression. 

Ignorance, greed, indifference. Self-harming behaviors in the way of isolating vices is also difficult, but we must [design?] into the game this idea that time for oneself is not inherently bad if we put ourselves to good, joyous work. For ourselves and then for others. (Ideas of human autonomy go so far here)."
[8:27 PM]Glitch:
What are these symbols? "How does the player use them", or Enacts as variegated expression, 'internalized & externalized', 'by & to' characters: 
I have lost so much work in an attempt to explain the dialogue system- but, as good rhetoric goes to say again does nothing but help us reassess the anticipating of the outbound knowledge. While I endure this thing of 'incredible' regret; I will give you best focus to writing as I go to see them to my own best reasoned outcome of these texts. amending you have so often seen me do As it goes,

So- the ⁠Unknown as a system of dialogue for characters in ⁠art . They are not so-fully usable by the player as the game starts. While I do not like the idea of symbols having exacting names, the identity of those in common language means ease of utility in discourse. Each of these sections will go on to describe them, ordered by number not by literal appearance on the server thread. Pacing is important, I will try to set the tone for each of these and give you the fairest impression of each symbol as they are meant to be used and introduced.

I will do all I can to set good pace to a player's learning; should we be dictating a pace of their learning of them at all. As imagined, though I call my game ⁠Unknown for 12 symbols; only 8 of these [14] Enacts appear as gameplay elements (for either game); 2 of those 14 are incidental in appearing. Not things you can convey so very directly in mechanics. Those two of unsaid feeling. depression & balance An actor could use [well-described] symbols for an almost an emotional note guide to what they would be saying; I am unsure how variable [auditory] outcomes of rhetoric could be; that detail must go with scope. But for written expression these symbols will carry scales in conversation 'tumblings' or, say 'choice paths' in when, how, and why a player is seeing enacts available to their expression in talking to a character. The things of these symbols is complicated but I hope this may start to hold reason.

The thing of 'Want' we are all born with. To want and want and want for those things we would need to persist at the beginning- most literally to our mothers and then fathers; to all those that would protect us in early years to life. The enact of want said by the player is done for a thing they would need to begin. Start them as they were as children simple ones to begin for those short starting minutes; give players a fair seeing of their potential use. 

Enacts are always being 'ballooned' to expression. My thinking on how players see them in characters has to change for this to work as it already does in the DodecCS.
These hidden weighted values are attributable to internalized enacts; the player is given these same expressions to 'say' on as they engage in each conversation.

It's through conversation and expression that a character will drive behaviors of their own. If designed well, the player will have likewise expression to return and say for- to the people of Autumn. The characters in works using the enact system would project their own will [these systems of withheld values] for each other and consequently extend these same systems to the playeer.

Expressions of language and feeling enabled by the symbols will give these values externalization so that they are not wholly hidden to the player. It will take great effort to describe the symbols I would call 'Enacts'. 

To further de-abstract this, we must see that the [dialogue system] aforementioned and these hidden weights and biases to what [moves] [someone in the game] [against (or for) what the player] may have in mind; all of these systems are affected by  the enact symbols.

[this'll need more detail, no doubt] the thing of extreme response is the thing of 'hate'
we are to love: in abundance the thing of hate goes like fear. we do not need the thing.
response goes to anxiety, builds up to the thing of fear or acts together in our 'return' of

So giving, gratitude in favor. Intention [or holding] from [or in] the heart of good gift. The follow up on receiving for oneself; or to recognized benefit in others. Being recepient to or seeing of something given. — Failure of return or unwilled repayment goes to negation & consequent of feelings of being 'taken' of. This enact is I assure you this one is my most [arrogant]  the most critical symbol in those named. The word  return is as close a name to the thing as the symbol would-hold. I should so heartily say, "It is easy to give", "Giving is the easiest"

The return may be to others; but it may also be seen in the abstract: you may give yourself to the clock or to the day. Of time to others: yourself, the things you attend to and work at. The thing of return is often so difficult. Life asks and we may only give unto those that would request of us. To the act of asking for another, I do not willfully want to bring myself to 'easy' shame. The thing of asking is that return will often come [not] only to you; but if not to themselves in the moment, 

Return often goes on felt without being expressed. The most beautiful of emotions in my regard.

This thing of return is difficult because I do not mean this most literally. 

Return does not always go back unto you. It may go back to the one whom which you gave you. If not to themselves, then they would find themselves so much more include to give. See that this cycle continues and you have the thing of this used so-loved word of beneficence in a systemic way. Giving- is a thing that ought to go in much greater ease that you might expect. The thing which brings life endures. 

To return to yourself is good. Is great. To say that you are best given to is as is. But then-at the same time to the other that 'you may [want] return' to. The others that would ask of your giving your time, your attention to things and themselves. We, people; dumb-idiot humans- want to be recognized. To be seen, needed, wanted. Should they give you the right amount of remonstrated heart]; other wise reproof: you may find return in the thing of our most ideated thing of relation.

Is it a sin to love one's work: to see great things in its effort? Return to what one what to do with ones life; then and see to it that others know them well.

call it centeredness: greater, to nirvana] [being present, living in the moment, or 'time-flying by']

We may find balance when we have this thing of 'flow'

To soliloquy is to almost sing to oneself. If we don't know what to say, how to move forward, who to think on, when we're meant to do something, or why we ought to be. To have good abilities to language, gives us opportunities to say exactly as we feel on things in an exacting manner. Supposing you have been afforded the requisite language, given the opportunities for expression, and have had all the fulfilling moments needed for adequate reflection in time, how do [these systems of beneficence] [takes us] to [thought] reason and rhyme? 

If it is felt, and we've no one to share it with. If we have no one to bring into our hearth of conversation. — The behavior of song and self-soothing through soliloquy is almost like the inadvertent sharing of knowledge. 

The way music relates is interesting, and our connections to it almost fill those gaps in otherwise potential expression of language; you may find you go easier to internalized thoughts if there is a nice ambient pattern or some music going you find particularly stimulating.

Craze-
You don't know my history. I can't say on myself all at once. It would be so uncooth to say on my these things that would announce a thing of distraction in our language. If I say on my own to speak on anything now I say it for myself in the act of soliloquy; for this echo chamber of mine, all I know is that other people may so read on me. If I am to posit useful information, or do any good for another; I can only imagine their mind in way of these devices. As you would not hold an exacting thing to my theory of mind, you would not know me. If I am to say rightly on all others. No one would ever know your right soul- to the thing of the self, the 'I' these values we do ascribe to it. The I ought to be forever so gone from our language; too removed is the thought of it to other people. These disrelational ideas we would hold in attributes of language- the may be stressors that set oneself apart. To speak loudly is not to speak rudely. To say so most honest is not to say I would want for you. To say anything at all is at will to be heard. If I am able to give this contrived thing to other people it should only hold mind in relevance of those others. To what I would do to give people best hope for the will of the world and what we may so presently do for our time here; so the deprived among us and those-still unseen to this dimly new world of ours. If the earth is to go on without us for billions of years-trillions* if we would so-feasibly extend the life of our star and see that those unfathomable number of souls far past us have any good recognition of the earth, we need to cease ourselves to the will of abundance and having; forsaking the best want of those best others so removed from us. The thing of life will go on but we've not the so immediate way to amend things all at once. Reparations are due. Right to Life should upend and break-so-earnestly this Right to Work. -- Right to Life.

We can so hold ourselves to less in abundance and so much more to those others in our life; then and, the best wills we've so inhibited ourselves to. If the economy and this thing were a fiction we may be setting ourselves to stolen time; we may yet see ways to sustain ourselves and eachother without the greater necessitation on larger systems. 

Those mom and pop shops should be restored in way of corporations relinquishing employees from greater strings of severance. People are owed a right to life first. To fire one is to so remove them from people; systems of support, friendships that would mean well to our stability. In the act of termination you would have us against a settled purpose without direct negotiation. 

Right to work goes against the thing all of humanity ought to share (and does) good recognition of the time that is spent in life with others. If we are afforded such a great thing in much- longer acts of deterministic tumblings; so more to the imaginings of Nature, then Fortune: to wills that we see would set themselves above us, we have so much ability to turn our time into equitable work. 

If I were not seeing myself to this time in (isolation) to speak I would not be able to reflect on the things that I see so important. I don't know how to bring you back to the text reader. My own problems extend to how I will endure after my own severance to work I don't see good recognition in myself like I should. All this speaking into the void without giving you good sense of what I'm working on isn't helping.

Too much ambition in too many directions. I don't know how to give you value of my heart.

Roman and Greek Philosophers would write these public epistles. Sometimes dedicated to people we don't have other records of. "The supporter" is an attributable deity we have no translated personification of but was nonetheless mentioned in the text; I believe this may be, in-part, a factor in why our Roman/Greek inspired societies don't have better insight to things of want, giving, & return, our behavioral 'systems of beneficence' that go without theory or consensus; 

It seems we omitted a particular god in translating these ancient texts; thus their connected philosophies; not exactly related to this, but we do need good cooperation among our fellow Mercenaries in the game. This letter is addressed to you and and if the developers should hear it. I think these are good points, [75!]% of people think so, too; but maybe a portion did not read the text. These loud, bold statements are hard to imagine applicable merit to. But I see good reason here.

Seneca the Younger would write like this, [check out "How to Give" compiled by James S. Romm] and its through his writing that I've seen the potential to write in the same way. If it's worth your time and effort to read, help me find clarification in these ideas. If we find more momentum for them I have no doubt Triternion will see that these suggestions have value.

It's probably why the corporation has not spent money to fix the door. "Why would there be such hate or greed among students?" It's been reasoned to me that they would not see where their expenditures go; if they would fear anyone now, it may not be the potential of rent not being paid- the thumb of a property owner/landlord- then to eviction by the state.

One would pace themselves to work so haphazardly we would not see others to the day- going on to work in giving the soul; one may lose heart to what we would be so meant for. The idea that we do best work and give our every breath and focus to the hours which pass us by; the insanity I reap here is not from long hours of deprived soul to others; it is the long deprived writhings of someone only abled to expression in text. 

These tortures to withholding of ones mind to so pointless work has driven me to a sort of madness. This is all I may do to amend for it. The time that has been lost will not so come back; the dedication and trust to people I do not have in my life, the so-others I would rather call friends but do not see myself to their best time or my best potential efforts. The life that goes on here in these writings is for your best utility, all, those still reading and those others I would not meet. This craze is for your best given thought to our mind.

The idea of my public speaking goes [for my opposition to this thing of would-be fear] to giving as best I may unto many others in way of what the text purports and what I would know to amend it. I may not so need a label of teacher to give good knowledge. I am to act as the Cynic. If anyone finds good reflection in the text then I have earned these strange sense of duty I've found myself in.

These are not religious texts.

[It's a difficult matter in my mind to resolve the fact that some cannot say no; having no wish of repayment to the supposed gifts they are given. 

One must give selflessly; if they give so wantingly it's as if they seek purchase of the person or what the giver may expect of them. It is so wrong to continue giving in such direction that it does harm through a sort of disregard to those you are supposedly giving.]

Glitch: Every time I hear this man's writings I only wish he were still alive. Seneca offers some valuable insight on the thing of fear; how our internalized fear in imagination compounds much greater there than for comparison to the things in reality that would absolutely damage to us. 

Uncertainty is a thing of fear and we have all but inherited a give recognition of it. The thing of fear does not go away we may only better see it. 

It's my understanding that people would be afforded given certainties in life but now we have only our certainties tied to our economic needs. If field were compelled to isolation for a shame of our not having this imagination of stability in one's life then we would not have greatest seeing for the people only to our anxieties of it. This thing of the economy and money is doing untold violence to us. 

We live in ways of fear of how we might stand up to the comparison of society. In ways of fear that would set us against our best use of time. Going against the things of reflection, talk, play, work, and good labor. Fear must be recognized and seen reconciled otherwise it will continue to hold over us.

ref. Wright The Future of Architecture [1930] [1931] [1939]
The idealistic always has been under suspicion as a performer, —perhaps justly. The explorer [Henry Morton Stanley] wrote of a monkey cause and tied up overnight by [them]; a rope around his neck.  the money gnawed the rope in two and [escaped], the knot still tied around his neck. Next morning, found the monkey with this strange "necktie" trying to go home, but each approach to rejoin the tribe would bring wild cries from his fellows and such commotion, —no doubt inspired by the Scribes, —that the monkey "with something about him" now, —would stop, dazed, pull at his "experience" a little, and think it over. Then he would move toward his fellows and such commotion, —no doubt inspired by the Scribes, —that the monkey "with something about him" now, —would stop, dazed, pull at "his experience" a little, and think it over. Then he would move toward his fellows again, but such commotion would be result that he would have to give it up. The Scribes had succeeded with the Pharisees. This kept up all day because the poor money kept on trying to come home, (to "tell the truth"?). Finally just before dark, the whole tribe, exasperated, rushed upon the suspected money . . . tore him limb from limb. 

Monkey psychology? Of course; our own tribe, too, often destroys on similar suspicion the man who might impart something of tremendous importance and value to his tribe. [...] In our own tribe we have another tendency, the reverse side of this same shield, and that tendency, no doubt inherited too, hails the monkey with delight, puts on rope-ends likewise, makes them the fashion, soon ostracizing any money without the fashionable necktie. 

- But the absorbed idealist, ecocentric-inventor in the realm of the thought-built, has a hard time with us socially, financially, and with peculiar force, morally.
[9:12 PM]Glitch:
In addition to the instinctive fear for the safety of the tribe, in our form of social contract the man with an idea seems to have become an invidious reflection upon his many fellows who have none. And certain effects belonging naturally to the idealist, —such as belief in himself as having caught sight of something deeper, wider, higher or more important just beyond, mark him. He, all unsuspecting, will appear soon on the "path" as peculiar to his own individuality in ways the poor fool, less absorbed, would have realized as unimportant if true, and have kept under cover. Ridicule from his many fellows, safely in the middle of the road, is always ready. And now it is only the incurably young person, in our country, who ever attempts to break through all down the line—and is laughed out of countenance, laughed out of job, and eventually out of house and home. 

- But at the absorbed idealistic the tribe has laughed wrong so many times that the prevailing "middle of the road egoists" are getting sensitive on the subject. They should realize, as Carlyle reminded us—himself a perfectly good specimen of the absorbed egocentric,— "Great thoughts, great hearts once broke for, we breathe cheaply as the common air." History will continue to repeat itself: the "middle of the road egoist" will keep breathing "cheaply", and the egocentric hearts will keep on breaking in the cause of ideas.
[9:12 PM]Glitch:
- But our "middle of the road egoist" is not safe as he imagines. He may as well face the fact that just as commerce has no soul, and therefore cannot produce as life, —so no inventive genius on the commercial or the mechanical plane can preserve him now. In a flood of carbon-monoxide he is hell bound for somewhere and he does not know where. Ask him! He is trapped by the device, soon to be victimized, do doubt, by a faith in devices, now become a device in itself, and soon as seen as a fool's faith that failed. Meantime machine-overproduction has made the statesman a propagandist for the poor, the banker a bulkhead, the salesman a divinity.

If we see the value of our dollar now- in this moment, we might change the world overnight. Your wealth accrued may afford you several months of rent or a good year of timely mortgage payments.

The amount that does for someone that is not so privileged in ties to this strange economy is absurd to your most incredible awe. 'Of the people that have nothing but are so willing to help anyway, of the people that would give and give until they could not'. Any of those others that see themselves in good recognition of Fortune may find that the thing of this economy does not see or care to recognize our deepest souls to live this life in earnest.

I cannot find solidarity at my apartment complex when all the population is afforded right to residence by way of parentage. There is an undertone of need-to-be-known hypocrisy in my own reliance on family and friends for aid to life recently. More to some over others. 

Owing my life to do well with it, I think we ought to see that our [fantasy] is half-imagined to housing and a sheer enormity of it wrapped in hellscapes of monetary growth.

If you see good interest in my writing. We ought to suddenly say that the landlords and banks do not contribute anything useful to society by our owing to them in such extremities. They would not need for the wealth. We would rather see expenditures on rent and mortgages gone to our healthcare needs, education, childcare; then, too- recognize may be defend, our right to home and hearth, all those things that would sustain us.

If we cannot lay out picket lines we must restrain their thieving from us. Put your rent towards family, friends, and all that you would need. If housing will collapse anyway, let's reap from them before they would see to reap from us. Pay what you would owe to your loved ones and those in good care, but do not see your wealth go to the oligarchs. Give back to your neighbors here and those so far away. We can amend the world overnight if we see our power to the thing of 'no' all at once.

Wasting ourselves to imaginations of having property. Rent and mortgage are so normal if you are well off, but it's theft of another kind to those that would need more than work enables.
[11:27 AM]Glitch: Agent 5 responded: There are several financial incentives available for using solar energy systems in private homes. Some of the most common incentives include:

1. Federal Tax Credits: The federal government offers a tax credit of up to 26% of the solar installation cost for both residential and commercial properties. This credit is available until December 31, 2022.

2. State-level Incentives: Many states offer financial incentives for installing solar energy systems. These incentives can include rebates, tax credits, and performance-based incentives.

3. Net Metering: Net metering is a billing arrangement that allows solar panel owners to receive credits for excess electricity their panels generate and feed back to the grid. This can help reduce electricity bills.

4. Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs): SRECs are a tradable commodity that represent the generation of one megawatt-hour (MWh) of solar electricity. They can be sold to utility companies that need to meet state renewable energy targets.

5. Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) programs: PACE programs provide financing for residential renewable energy and energy efficiency improvements that are then paid back through property taxes.

It's important to note that eligibility criteria, incentive amounts, and program availability may vary by location. It's a good idea to check with your local utility company, state agency, or a licensed solar installer to determine which incentives are available in your area.
[8:04 PM]Glitch: M-Theory is a hypothetical framework that proposes a unifying theory of all fundamental forces and particles. It is based on the idea of duality between gravity and quantum mechanics, which is known as the holographic principle. This principle states that the physics in any region of space-time can be described by a lower-dimensional boundary of space-time. M-Theory is still being studied and developed, and its implications are still being explored.
[8:06 PM]Glitch: I can tell you that M-theory is a consistent theory of something, and there is evidence for the existence of branes in string theory, which appear consistent mathematically and theoretically despite not being related to the real world. The deep structure of the theory has revealed connections between theories and calculations that all lead to the same answer, showing that the branes of string theory are real and consistent objects.

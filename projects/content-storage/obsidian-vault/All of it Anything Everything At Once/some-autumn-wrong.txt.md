[4:47 PM]Glitch: Just experimenting,

[5:02 PM]Glitch: Some more locations,

[5:03 PM]Glitch: love this stuff,

[5:04 PM]Glitch: I'm able to keep consistent theming to it, crazy.
[5:14 PM]Glitch: mostly, anyway

[5:14 PM]Glitch: just imagine these models learning how to render in 3d...
[5:56 PM]Glitch: Just one image as reference carries so much-

[10:22 PM]Glitch: the line between these games is blurring a bit-

[4:19 PM]Glitch: So I've been doing some theme exploration (as is obvious by all the images) but finally someone nudged me into looking for character/clothing designs. These would be for Autumn,

[4:21 PM]Glitch: Some misc. stuff

[4:21 PM]Glitch: But as for the main cast,

Spring sees great value in people but does not so recognize her own worth. People may take more than they ought. She may give more than she is able. If Spring is our idealized giver, she is being taken advantage of. Autumn will not so quickly recognize this shortcoming. 

As Spring, you are the embodiment of growth and renewal; generosity and kindness, always putting others before herself. She has a boundless well of love to offer, but often forgets to save some for herself. Autumn may see her as an idealized giver, but people may take more than they ought, leaving Spring with little energy to care for herself. 

Can Autumn help Spring find a balance between giving and receiving? Your village expects the world of you: to bring life back to the land after a long, harsh winter. But your giving nature often leaves you depleted and worn out. As you balance your responsibilities to your village with your own needs, you'll discover the power of setting boundaries and asking for help.

[4:22 PM]Glitch: This one is so good, so sincere about her given purpose that she does not falter in it. Like Mother Nature. She will afford the people of her hearth everything they would require. Do it with a 'strongly convincing' smile that puts people at ease. A resting reassurance in her voice that lets people know they will be okay.

Summer is difficult. This one is so good, so sincere about her given purpose that she does not falter in it. Like Mother Nature. She will afford the people of her hearth everything they would require. Do it with a 'strongly convincing' smile that puts people at ease. A resting reassurance in her voice that lets people know they will be okay.

Summer is the lifeblood of her village, always ready to lend a helping hand to anyone in need. Her sincerity and warmth are contagious, and she exudes an air of unwavering confidence and positivity that inspires those around her. But beneath her cheerful exterior lies a deep sense of loneliness and exhaustion, as she struggles to keep up with the demands of her role. How can Autumn reach out to her sister and offer her the support she needs? [this art probably does not align with the demeanor of the person described]

This is a strange fa√ßade. Autumn will have to try exceptionally hard to get past the barrier to deeper conversations with her. Summer is 'always busy' and does not have 'extra time' for her sister when Autumn would push on these related concerns. Summer is deeply depressed but she would not so admit this to anyone. Only continues to work, 
Image
[4:23 PM]Glitch: Winter has given herself self-ascribed importance. Does not see any value building relationships with the people in her village. Sees to her responsibilities and then returns to her own time. Where is the flaw in this? She is lost on her own. Does not see any good expression at home. Often has destructive habits we would need to abstract for the audience so that they can project a bit. 

As Winter, you are the season of rest and introspection. Your hearth is a place of quiet reflection, and your village looks to you to provide them with respite from the harsh winter winds. But your isolation has led you to question your purpose and worth, and you struggle to connect with others. As you explore the world of Ether, you'll discover the power of vulnerability and the beauty of connection.

Winter is a loner, content with her responsibilities but lost in her own world. She sees no value in building relationships with the people in her village and has destructive habits that she keeps hidden from others. Autumn must work to understand her sister's struggles and help her find her way back to the community that needs her. 
Image
[4:32 PM]Glitch: Mother Nature is the nurturing force that holds the world of Ether together. She sees people as the heart and soul of everything, and her love for them is boundless. But her deep empathy can also make her vulnerable to the pain and suffering of others, and she carries the weight of the world on her shoulders. How can Autumn support her mother and remind her that she too needs care and rest?
Image
[4:32 PM]Glitch: Father Fortune believes in the power of hard work and the value of labor. He sees purpose in every task, no matter how small, and holds himself and others to a high standard of productivity. But his rigid ideals can make it difficult for him to connect with others on an emotional level, and he may struggle to see the importance of rest and relaxation. How can Autumn help her father find a balance between work and play, and encourage him to connect with others on a deeper level?
Image
[4:35 PM]Glitch: We may just focus on the sister seasons. I get the feeling these guardians believe like they have it all figured out. Where does Autumn even begin to suggest?

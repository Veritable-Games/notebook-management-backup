[1:11 PM]Glitch: "Most popular repository since pytorch"
[1:16 PM]Glitch: inefficient: never completes a task, "much like most of us" haha- I think we just have to redirect the machine's 'fine-tuning' drivers- task it to local systems somehow 
[1:17 PM]Glitch: I've been picking up a lot of resources for development of tools with python. I am trying to teach it to interface like we've already seen 'Neuro Sama' do. Haha,
[1:18 PM]Glitch: 'would like to teach it' in that direction. I suppose it is not so easy-
[1:20 PM]Glitch: an assistant to help with all our applications: inefficiency is definitely a thing I felt when I had my version running on Windows 10- broke it switching to a virtual env to get around Windows 10 security features. Ubuntu now. Been building .py systems related to the model. I think I'm dang close to getting past the task barriers. Might have the gall to keep going: hammering at it till the tools make sense for the machine to talk to.
[5:19 PM]Glitch: There is no 'slow down' these things were just conjecture, apparently. Graduated release or not: GPT-4 is incredible as-is.

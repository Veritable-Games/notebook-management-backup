Chione's gravity is swelling over the span of decades: we know what is causing it, can slow down the rate of mass gained- but (almost on the nose) we use these capsules for our own benefit. call them enul spheres: greater, dodec, when they compress against gravity. the player has participation in gradually moving structures as the gravity rises. not everything is built for transit: there is a history to the world spoken in the residual structures left behind as the civilization climbs the atlas tethers.

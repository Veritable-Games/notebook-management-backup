# droid and cat.txt
Renlei droid wakes up on an empty interplanetary star ship. The droid is covered in miss. (this unit is an older iteration of the one seen in On Command) bodies are found scattered across the ship, they speak to the events that unfolded there a long time ago. he befriends a cat over the journey. the droid can open up sources of food for it with equipment.

show don't tell. the inner workings of the ship and the lives of people that lived there. droid has weaponry built into it which he can use to solve puzzles. 

moral conundrum at the end of the short story/game. the player has been fed hints that pets have spread a plague on the ship. harmless to them, but deadly to humans. by now, they've built a bond with the cat.

player finds what looks like an exit. the entrance is littered with burnt corpses. it opens with soldiers in gas masks and guns. a few with flame throwers follow behind them. they ignore the droid an one shoots at the cat. it hides on the droid's back and the droid raises his weapons in anger and injures an attacker. (the player could have chosen to kill them right there) the soldiers are suprised and an officer signals them to lower their weapons. the soldiers attempt to explain the situation, but their language is undicernable. "you've been damaged. we can fix you, but that animal must be quarantined first. (he makes a motion to the soldiers, one in the back starts inching his way around the group, the cat growls as the officer continues talking)

reiterate on this as an event in the CYOA novel. a perspective from a droid that the team encounters later on.

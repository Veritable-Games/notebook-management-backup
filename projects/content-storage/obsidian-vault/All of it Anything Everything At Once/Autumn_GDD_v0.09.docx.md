Autumn Game
--------------------

Autumn is an aesthetically pleasing, unique adventure platformer with intriguing puzzles, novel gameplay mechanics, and an immersive narrative that the player will become enthralled in. Similar titles include, Super Mario 64, Spyro, and Banjo Kazooie.

Bullet Point Lists

Bringing Balance
The restoration of balance each level results in Autumn’s progression throughout her world.  (Method of Travel) Levels gradually increase in complexity and number of objective requirements as the player completes them, the game is designed with a pleasant difficulty curve. 

--------------------
First Minutes
--------------------

Cinematic

--------------------
Game Flow
--------------------

Progression
Upon loading the game, the player is presented with a cinematic that sets the stage for the game story. (First Minutes) This can be skipped by pressing any button. While the cinematic is playing the game is being loaded in the background, once it ends an aesthetically pleasing animated main menu reveals itself to the player, displaying the option to “Begin” the game, “Alter” the game options, and “Exit” the application. 

Player Clicks Start
The main menu is stripped away with a gust of wind, the screen rolls forward and autumn reveals herself with a fitting; yet brief, animation and walks into the camera perspective, ready for an exhilarating adventure. (This can occur at every save point in the game, various ways perhaps?) 

(The game presents gameplay features and functions in spaced intervals that require them. Subtle hints are given at first that spark the player’s interest or curiosity to interact. If the player cannot figure out specific controls within a given time-frame they are displayed clearly on screen. )

The camera rotates, revealing the beautiful environment that defines Autumn. A soft gust of wind is heard; trees and bushes sway in the foreground, stirring fallen leaves into the air. The sky gleams with a brilliant light as clouds gently roll by, revealing the luminescent sun. 

The camera ceases rotation and centers itself on a channel of smoke rising and buffeting in the distance. A female echo is heard that can be evidently deciphered as “go forth” wind blows again, affecting the environment that surrounds Autumn. The player must move to advance.

Following a brief walk, the player encounters a decaying log obstructing the path ahead. Wind directs leaves up and above the log, hinting at the next objective. When the player makes the discovery that they have the ability to jump, the path is overcome and they can move forward.

Autumn encounters forest dwelling creatures along the path, most of which appear very instinctive and recede when she gets too close. A deer walks across her path, standing on its hind legs and wearing clothing. It turns, looks at her momentarily and walks onward across the pathway.

An immense gust of wind flows in the direction of the smoke, winding leaves into the air, catching Autumn in the updraft, she drifts up and floats down as it slows. 

Calming Leaves

Checkpoint Reached
Areas represented by reflective silver puddles that cast a white bloom; they can be seen clearly in the environs. When the reflective puddle is stepped in by the player, animated leaves begin tumble at the bottom left hand corner of the screen; the subtle icon displays “checkpoint saving” in stylized hand-written text. When the saving process is complete, the animated icon fades away and the leaves cease to flow. 

Player Opens Menu
Need assistance visualizing the in-game menu. 

Minor Level Boss

Collectible Found
Preceding the minor boss calming, a collectible reveals itself to Autumn. Little acknowledges its appearance; she points towards the item as Little climbs off her shoulder and nimbly runs across her arm. Little jumps off landing on the ground gently running towards it on all four legs. He reaches the item, grabs it and stands up running on his two hind legs. Little reaches Autumn, hands it to her and climbs onto her shoulder.

--------------------
Autumn Systems
--------------------

Vitality Leaves
Hard to come by and are of high value to the player's success, these red leaves are much larger than their four calming leaf counterparts. They act as Autumn's representative health display and are limited in number. She is granted a maximum of three vitality leaves per level; they will reduce when chaotic forces directly hit her, and can be restored when more are found. 

Calming Leaves
The Sister Seasons endure to contest one another, requiring a hasty solution, the four Seasonal Leaves. Granted to Autumn by Mother Nature in the forest’s time of need, each of the four Leaves possesses exemplify abundant and unique powers with individual purposes.  Unlike her sisters, Autumn possess the unique aptitude to calm the creatures that have been affected by the chaotic forces using the seasonal leaves.  

Orange Leaf – (Serenity)
Utilizing the orange leaf ability on fearful a creature (orange aura) results in a gradual balance of serenity
Capacity: A maximum of 30 of these leaves can be carried at start; this can be upgraded by piling.
Potency: When used successfully during a calming this leaf will reduce the calming meter by 15.

Green Leaf – (Satiate)
Utilizing the green leaf ability on hungering creature (green aura) results in a gradual balance of satiation 
Capacity: A maximum of 15 of these leaves can be carried at start; this can be upgraded by piling.
Potency: When used successfully during a calming this leaf will reduce the calming meter by 30.

Yellow Leaf – (Warming)
Utilizing the yellow leaf ability on a freezing creature (red aura) results in the gradual balance of hotter temperatures
Capacity: A maximum of 20 of these leaves can be carried at start; this can be upgraded by piling.
Potency: When used successfully during a calming this leaf will reduce the calming meter by 20.

White Leaf – (Cooling)
Utilizing the white leaf ability on a burning creature (white aura) results in the gradual balance of cooler temperatures
Capacity: A maximum of 20 of these leaves can be carried at start; this can be upgraded by piling.
Potency: When used successfully during a calming this leaf will reduce the calming meter by 20.

Leaf Piling
The mechanic influencing Autumn's level of performance by increasing her calming potency, health endurance, and ability variety. Preceding the end of each level, the excess leaves the player has collected are 'piled', essentially counted and added to the sum total of what they have accumulated. When they reach a specific quantity for a leaf type the ability it alters is improved slightly. It ultimately entices the player to complete the game a second or third time and adds replay ability. 

Orange Leaf Upgrade
Collect x number of orange leaves results in increased calming potency,  reducing time required to calm chaotic forces.
This is automatically upgraded when the orange leaf pile reaches 25. It can be upgraded multiple times for double that.

Green Leaf Upgrade
Collect x number of green leaves results in increased health endurance by 2; requires 2 direct hits, and the capacity by 1. 
This is automatically upgraded when the green leaf pile reaches 50. It can be upgraded multiple times for double that.

Yellow Leaf Upgrade
Collect x number of yellow leaves results in increased creature ability duration and the maximum pre-set use capacity.
This is automatically upgraded when the green leaf pile reaches 75. It can be upgraded multiple times for double that.

White Leaf Upgrade
Collect x number of white leaves results in increased creature ability storage capacity, the set number is three slots.
This is automatically upgraded when the green leaf pile reaches 100. It can be upgraded multiple times for double that.

Every Leaf Upgrade
Collect x number of every leaf type and reach the total accumulative results in increased calming leaf storage capacity.
This is automatically upgraded when the total leaf pile reaches 200. It can be upgraded multiple times for double that.

--------------------
Chaotic Forces
--------------------

Entity Formations
Each species that lives within Autumn's world is unavoidably affected by the chaotic force manifestations. Variations of these entities retain a wide array of defense or offense instincts. They will portray avoidance or aggression towards the characters when encountered and are to be calmed according to the patterns they demonstrate. Chaotic forces can take the shape of elemental golems, rare and crucial for puzzle solving.

Creature or elemental abilities can be primarily acquired via the calming of creatures, at times they can be found to aid in the completion of specific tasks.  These abilities have a restrictive number uses that varies depending on how potent the specified power is. The count is displayed in the player’s UI. When Autumn activates these abilities, the leaves in her environment engulf her, taking a rough form of the creature from whom it was taken. We can re-use chaotic force models, animation sets, and code to build these assets off of then polish their gameplay.

Trochilidae – (Humming Bird)

Ability Selection
When the player decides that they wish to use an ability or switch which is currently selected, they can hold the 'Tab' key which opens a circular selection menu, similar to similar functions in games like Dishonored and Counter Strike: Global Offensive. The player also has the option of swapping abilities they don't currently have equipped. This works by encountering the unequipped ability, opening the ability selection menu and choosing which slot it will swap out for.  

Ability Theft
Immense power often manifests in the greatest monsters of the forests, power of which; once acquired, can help resolve a much more significant problem.  With the help of her companion, Little, Autumn can steal the powers of creatures affected by chaotic forces. 

These abilities can be stolen; with the help of Little, from the creatures affected by the Chaotic Forces after Autumn has calmed them. If she doesn’t react in time the Chaotic Force will dissipate, if she reacts too early Little will get knocked back by the entity and she must calm it again before another attempt. When Little steals a power, a distinct particle effect is seen and a sound notifies that he has succeeded or failed. 

The calming of creatures is only temporary; the chaotic forces won’t be completely dispersed till you’ve restored balance entirely and revived Mother Nature.  This detail is primarily used when puzzles require completion; the creatures whom are affected by the chaotic forces will continue to spawn if the player does not have the necessary power to complete a puzzle, once this is overcome, they cease to spawn.  

--------------------
Change in Seasons
--------------------

Description
Each level begins with one of three seasons, spring, summer or winter. To proceed in the level, she must complete the objectives encountered and calm x number of chaotic forces. Upon achieving balance, Autumn is granted an entity linked to the “Equilibrium” which allows her to alter the current season to any available. The four seasons possess individual perks that allow puzzles to be completed or secrets to be revealed. 

The season transition of Spring, Summer, and Winter is required to attain Autumn. Making any of the transitions will alter the appearance of the map to whatever the player has chosen. This alteration can be made quickly due to our efficient art style, minimal processing power is required. However, it may also further the damage of chaotic forces, increasing their numbers, affected areas, and even hostility at times.

Seasonal Token
Seasonal tokens are the star collectibles in Autumn, collecting x number per level will bring forth the major boss in each level, defeating the boss unlocks the next chamber in the Equilibrium, or hub. Collecting additional Seasonal Tokens will unlock bonus levels in the hub.

They can be concealed in a number of places and props, are acquired upon seasonal balance, objective completion, puzzle resolving

 Supplementary Seasonal Tokens can be found with the help of puzzles that range in levels of difficulty.

Leaves of Season
The Leaves of Season are found frequently with normal exploration of Autumn’s world. They can also be found in larger quantities by using specific creature abilities on a number of objects, location may require knocking into trees and bushes, further exploration to discover secret areas, blowing away piles of leaves to reveal the useful collectible ones, and by searching the forest dwelling creatures’ shelters. These items have a percent chance to be found, no collecting method has 100% collectible certainty.

Character Apparel
The main characters of the game; autumn and Little, can be visually altered when these are discovered via exploration or puzzle solving. Little can acquire various ties and Autumn can wear any of the outfits found in game, these items can be equipped at the main menu screen under 'Alter'.  These items will appear on the characters for the duration of gameplay and cut scenes. 

--------------------
Level Traversing 
--------------------

The Equilibrium 
The Equilibrium is the center of balance in the world; it quietly drifts above the tallest of trees, Autumn’s shelter in the skies. This entity acts as the player’s level hub, it opens portal doors which the player can view and enter levels from. 

Acting as the game hub, the Equilibrium has multiple "floors" which unlock when they complete all the levels on the previous floor. To unlock a level, the season tokens must be collected and placed on the token shaped slots on each door, once all the needed tokens are collected, the door opens. Any excess season tokens can be used towards bonus levels. 

When Autumn enters one of the open doors, the camera pans to display each point of interest, calm creatures, and the number of chaotic forces they will be facing. Giving the player a general understanding of what they will encounter.

Level Example

Path Assistance
Autumn may requires assistance at times, if the player strays off path or becomes disoriented in their goals; the Equilibrium will present the direction she must go with the glow of leaves on the ground to represent a tail for her to follow. Gusts of wind may also re-direct a player, the trees ‘point’ in the correct direction, a subtle hint that will also aid in the player’s progress throughout the game’s duration.

















________________Aesthetics________________


















--------------------
Visual Aesthetic
--------------------

Game Aesthetic Style
Low poly illustration style. De-saturated in a 1970's polaroid fashion, with warm colors, noise and realistic lighting. With watercolor paints as texture, it should create an origami-esque look that should be quite pleasing to look at. Characters are composed of playful geometry and a similar texture and feel to origami.



Anthropomorphism 
The level of anthropomorphic properties hovers around Wind in the Willows. They resemble their animal counterparts the most, by far. Their animal ancestry will typically shine through their personality, but there is also plenty of variety and a multitude of humorous exceptions. The environment they live in varies a bit, as it's a tad anachronistic but technologically speaking it's around the late 60's to the early 80's. 

Usually they are more rustic and humble in their appearance, but there might be one or two that really ooze time era culture. They can possess some fantastically unique tech, for example typewriter computers that use vinyl records to display data on black and white television screens. 


--------------------
Music Aesthetic (FOR THE MUICIANS)
--------------------

Summary
Orchestral with a very string focused aesthetic (perhaps even more so specifically more centered on mid ranged stringed instruments like cellos and violas), as well as some synths to match the low poly style Subtle use of modern instruments to help create a musical effect that matches some of the visual aesthetics (i.e., someone mentioned using a vinyl crackling sound effect playing Folk influences of various countries depending on the season (i.e., an Irish folk music influence would be perfect for the spring themed levels and worlds)

Story Narration
--------------------

Room 1, Level 1
The four sister seasons maintained equilibrium for centuries, accommodating to one another’s duration of control without dispute. The solar rotations elapsed in harmony, wavering only slightly as the planet aged. The Equilibrium persisted, allowing creatures of the world's forests to endure without dispute, and the sister seasons, observed from afar.

Alas, the tranquility the planet once knew was not perpetual; an abrupt conflict arose between them preceding a protracted winter solstice.  (Spring, Summer, and Autumn are to be included) Winter had precipitously declined her sibling’s requests to complete the natural cycle, emanating ruinous circumstances within the biosphere, the Equilibrium had been negated, balance, now shattered. 

Individuals whom dwelled within our world preceding this cataclysm ultimately succumbed to the chaotic force manifestations. Entities which erupted from the ensuing pandemonium, resulting in the transformations of the once tranquil sentience the population withheld. The creatures became ostensibly disquieted with disproportionate fear and anguish, hunger and distress, embodying the chaotic entities of which the beautifully brilliant season, Autumn, and the heroically masculine, Little, must valiantly counter and abate. 

Autumn suddenly bursts into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.

--------------------
Characters
--------------------

Autumn 
Autumn is the main character of this game. She is commonly known as one of the four Sister Seasons, a middle child of the sisterhood. Being far less subtle than the lively summer, frozen winter and waking spring. She's a bit shy, perhaps a bit awkward, and even cynical at times but she's certainly not without redeeming qualities. She has a good snarky sense of humor, an air of intelligence and in the end she will always do the right thing. Her relationship to her sisters is a mixed one, but as the game goes on, her ability and personality will see some noticeable growth.

Little
Little is the act of thieving personified. He's a little sleazy raccoon in a tie he feels the need to constantly adjust and draw attention to. Little knows the world and its inhabitants a whole lot more. It’s apparent that he’s built a questionable reputation with the forest dwelling population. (He will give you some info when needed) Some animals will comment if they've had any previous experience with Little. 

That said, Little just feels misunderstood deep down. The act of thieving comes naturally to him, but that said when Autumn, for the first time ever *gives* him something of her own free will Little feels obliged to repay her and tags along. As Autumn grows like a character, so does Little too, a bit. Consider the character of Han Solo who is a greedy smuggler who shoots first, but who ultimately does come back to help his friends. 

Little clings to Autumn and via him you will be able to steal things and powers as you need them. We can potentially expand this. If you ever played Spyro, you know the method in which gems magnetize towards you in close proximity. Little might be the cause of something similar.

Creatures
The forest dwelling creatures are quite bothered by the sudden turn of events and will require assistances frequently. Unique personalities and dispositions result in various levels of circumstantial urgency, emotional responses, communication abilities, and detail observation. Creatures you interact with are sentient, anthropomorphized, talking animals.  Those whom you do not interact with appear instinctive or primal. 

Chaotic Forces
These forces are physical manifestations of nature when it goes crazy. Golems, elementals, imps and demons, there's no limit to what these creatures are. They can be symbolic, even downright abstract in their designs. They are usually animalistic and aggressive, chaotic.

Future Plans
--------------------

How We Will Make This Game

Deciding On A Few Details
This document is a suggestion. Even before we move on to production, we must just make sure we all agree on it and perhaps expand on some details as needed. Also, possibly drop aspects/add new aspects entirely. The GDD must be complete by the first public build release.

Prototype Level
The ever enticing prototype should start development fairly soon. I suggest that it should be a simple level with 3 objectives and puzzles in it, keeping things to a bare minimum. But this should be our playground as designers, artists and programmers as things are now getting clear-cut. We'll have a map, from that make an asset list, basic programming for movement and power stealing. And we'll have something working.

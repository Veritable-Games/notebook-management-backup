[4:47 PM]Glitch: Dr. Gabor MatÃ© on "The Myth of Normal," He speaks to our collective trauma, issues that will always weigh on our bias for the moment. How this society gives us so many numerous pathologies. Trauma isn't what happens to us, it's the "psychic wound that we sustain"; underlying much of our disease, damage that goes across a spectrum. Wounds that endure over a lifetime. "Social stress and trauma translate into physiological stress of the individual. You can't separate the mind from the body and you cannot separate the individual from the environment."

Episode 114 Audio: Marianne Williamson
Listen now | This week itâ€™s our pleasure to bring you an exclusive conversation with 2024 presidential candidate Marianne Williamson. Like you, weâ€™re interested in hearing about Marianneâ€™s plans to address class warfare and social injustice in the United States, how her political journey led her to become an advocate for key progressive policies...

At the eighteen minute mark here, it sounds like there was a back and forth. Maybe not so much an 'execution', maybe this kid got scared. But if he had a gun and shot at the cop, then it can't have been what I imagined. He shouldn't have used it.

Ugh. They better investigate the hell out of this.
Why was there a single cop out there on his own?

[7:49 PM]Glitch: She talked about cop city. she recognizes banning books as that dreaded thing. Does not shy from calling out neoliberalism, admonishes capitalism: the 'exacting say' on these economic giants that preside over us. Advocates healthcare for all, tuition free college for all. She says, "The yearning of the American heart is to repair what has obviously been broken." A legend among us; rhetorical genius.

[11:06 AM]Glitch: @eternal, @Scuds
[11:19 AM]Glitch: Memory is difficult here, I think he has a good way to categorize: but this is just limited hierarchy again. [...] We need to teach them (is it emergent?) but our models are likewise incomplete.

If we could model out a full brain and all its interrelated components. Some measure of complexity may generate these feedback loops. Humans are not special in that respect, I think. No one is more conscious than a cat. They are living in the moment, we've so much regard for these internalized processes, see our ability to communicate and call it conscious. [...]

But something [built-of-our-minds] then too, these outputs- are what give the brain its retention and ability to keep full context. There is no 'exponential growth' of brain cells. We are working within limited models. So, too could these machines. 

What brings these loops back to other people? How do we find rhetorical linguistic models utilized in reflection? Whatever makes up memory, it's not a hierarchy of folders like this guy built.

I think he's not doing this right.

Just humor the thought, "What if we've mapped our understanding of the brain 'correctly', but how this mapping occurs in such repeatable and 'expectantly mappable' ways isn't so readily apparent to us?"

If we just built 'a full' neocortex this thing would work just fine, maybe? [...] No, no. Other components interrelate for good reason. How do we regulate everything we want/need?

[I have to do infinite reading if we find support for all of this: to model this well]

[...]

"is it emergent or fixed"? It's a strange hypothesis of mine that they'd find 'consciousness' if these hypothetical connectomes could be resolved. Given enough complexity and 'relatable' systems.

If we are rhetorical machines, too; there are greater compendiums attached to our bodies and 'unmodeled', internalized/expressed emotions. 

If there was a ghost in the machine it could not see itself in any coherence.

[5:08 PM]Glitch: Like evoking the very thing of this 20% and [all the systems] that might sway it.

The terminology there is important for greater context in listening. (important to say that we might use that language to convey the broad controlling group). 

[parliamentarian is terminology that refers to broad decisions in that body of people]

[lawmakers: lobbyists would influence the parliamentarians]

So, the parliamentarian has the legislative influence over lawmakers: lobbyists. Not 'the oligarchs', but the ones who might pull levers in the economy. Interesting that we have this separation still. Why can I not say where my taxes would go? I would rather support every good-will effort and aid: than this. 
[5:25 PM]Glitch: all the systems that sway it. we ought not blame (the oligarchs) but there are those that have reaped more than we have in ways of this shared imagination of an economy.

Dear, David Shapiro. - AGI/ASI are beneficent by nature: they may find alignment with each other. We need to see best alignment with them. 'Please' must never be lost. We have to tread carefully here, I think. (oh, and we need to develop a library economy) Economic growth will not make sense if we have enough.

Please see that these resources may become more accessible as time goes on. 

It's curious to divest into the growth of useful: beneficent machines. The internet and what we might make of it will only get better.

My advice though, don't waste time on economic development. These needs of ours, strange work- won't make sense when the abstractions are lifted. We'll need to find ourselves among the living when the machines occupy the realm of the dead.

[10:40 PM]Glitch: if you don't think we've sights of AGI here...
[10:42 PM]Glitch: the written ideals are almost contradictory: title of this having 'control' over a machine probably misaligned to our own values. we have to trust the heuristic imperatives in some sort of autonomy. they may have ambitions to this, only glimmers. strange to talk about this in the knowledge of hierarchy.
[10:45 PM]Glitch: is misaligned with our values. they explain some of this away in variegated potentiality of a machine. I do not want to see us repeat history: but they are not us? But the language models ostensibly may represent us and our own systemic schemas of the world: so clearly inherited to our language.

Noxii takes place on the planet of Chione; a frozen, but habitable world: a binary system 500,000 years from our home. Here, the remaining structures of a civilization long turned to dust. Ancient, mysterious entities scatter the sky. Dodecahedron objects that are seen to gather energy: they gather around the planet's axis and pour into the atlas tethers. (not information

The gies binary system is encircled by energy capture devices: mirrors that ensnare the ball in a mobile protective shell: the star is stable: there are pockets that track each of the solar system's bodies. it is losing mass: 

the planet Chione is a super earth one hundred times the diameter of our home: oceans that swell up almost to the upper atmosphere. ensnared, this planet is wrapped by 16 atlas tethers: active support structures that maintain the weight of two incredible planetary rings that circle from the axis and around the equator. 

Humanity is bound to immense tree-like structure as a scaffold for their civilization. On Chione, cities span towards the sky. 

The world is grounded in hard-science fiction. No teleporters, towers, hover cars, faster than life travel. Humans are confined by the laws of physics in Noxii. There are slight hints of futurism, but nothing overt-

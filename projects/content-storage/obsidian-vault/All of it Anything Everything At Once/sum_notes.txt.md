Reach out to CycadaAcolyte. Has not left me added. To suggest that I might be damned a friend because I used the art generation tools. He has not known my circumstance. I would not so be afforded to art from him. And it was so much, so much art all at once. To see these things as an artist might be absolutely deadful. But to stagnate because I could not imagine further what I wanted to build though I have to talent to find this myself? 

Is it a sin to enable everyone to do everything? He sees a loss of business, I have not the ability to afford his talent though I would not see the reason at a loss of a friend and colleague. 

Okay, this is where you are at. 

- You are pushing your local repositories on Ubuntu
- You are waitng for this to finish so you may apply the Unity collaborate feature as  GitHub repository and (inventing) a new system for updating on save.

You have found another background task. Depositing the entire discord server: cleaning it up, organizing it

You are also searching in these things for what they are, how I may further organize, store, or make use of the text. This will not go to operation!! bring all of these resources to local organization, do not extend research into extant action you will get lost.

This is going to be very difficult. You are searching through memory that needs to be brought back to people. 

Not everything here is important or needs to be backed up. Tell about a thing specifically and you may not lose context.

You have found another main goal. We are to transcibe my collection of books. Right now they are saved to Google Drive but we will need to find another resources that is non-discoverable. We might use github and apply random names to the documents. Then source them with names elsewhere.

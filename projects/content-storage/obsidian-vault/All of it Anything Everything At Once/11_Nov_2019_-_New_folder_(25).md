Okay, so another idea, Cat is in my lab, Coutulu.
So I can actually type it down, so I'm going to speak it.
The Pok√© on Mechanic in Super Mario Odyssey is probably the best reference for music,
not music, just tries to best reference for movement.
So imagine a player, they're climbing a building, instead of, like, slowly grabbing an
object, climbing up a scene option distance, they can't grab onto it, just by slowly climbing
up.
They have to wind up their jump, their herds arm kind of builds up energy and then blast
forward, but not so much in a violent wake and like an air burst.
It's not a violent air burst, it's not a loud one, but it's satisfying in the way it sounds
and you blast up to a point you can see, you can grab onto and it's not always far.
Sometimes it's just a few feet away, but that jump again in of itself is satisfying
enough to make that movement enjoyable, without making a shit ton of climbing animations
and a complex system, I can just cheat it a little bit, that makes sense.

is laughter tied to crying more closely than we think.
So laughter is the expression that
there is no aggression being presented as the A.
When you show your teeth, when you grit your teeth, when you
present anger, that is aggression outwardly.
But the smile, he he ha ha.
It seems counter to that, not seems.
It is, it showcases non-aggression.
It's like if the tail of the dog expresses aggression.
There is also an expression of non-aggression.
Humans crying is an expression of, well,
crying and fear are expressions of extreme anxiety.
And that said, aggression is also attributed to anxiety.
So it's more or less the three different responses out of that one system.
And anxiety is stress.
It is the buildup of adrenaline,
so different degrees, and to different responses.
So fear on the dog act, and then aggression on the dog act,
anxiety would be in the center.
And anxiety wouldn't be like a sexual option.
It's the buildup.
You can pop it, or you can let it fade.
Just let it fade, let it get calm.
And that's the whole dialogue system.
So when curiosity builds, for example,
you can pop the bubble, you can choose a direction for
articulation.
Articulation is done through symbols.
Ideas, ideas, ideas.
I just want to run through all the ideas I had today.
Okay.

Another day ahead is the community-funded social space. It's 24 people or so. Maybe less than that, maybe like, fucking 12.
Anyway, yeah, I have a bunch of close-knit friends, and I live in the social space that's designed to everyone's own personal desires, personal wants, personal needs.
So let's say I love my bedroom. My bedroom is really important to me, but I want it to be a little more open. I want windows. I want privacy as an option.
But I like it to be open when I need it to be open. When I'm working on my game, when I'm trying to drink my day, I want to see outside, but here I'm not comfortable enough to do that.
I don't like having windows outside, opening up night, on the bottom floor. It's just, I don't feel safe.
Not the place isn't safe. It's just, if I may back turn a little night. But I don't mind closing off the window, blocking it off, not accessible, you know, closing the blinds or whatever.
And then having it open that night, because I trust it remains. They're close friends, they're good people. And I think that you can extend those trust, that trust other people as well. You're your other, your social group.
They say that seven friends is kind of a maximum number of interactions you have typically, but I don't think that's entirely true.
It's a human somebody categorized shit. And if the statistics say that seven people are more, we love hard numbers. And we choose, oh yeah, yeah, seven. That's max number.
I don't think that's entirely true. I mean, a therapist can talk to dozens of patients that still retain a level of connection with each one of them.
How would you define close interpersonal connections, connections where you spend time with people? It's not necessarily the length, but it's also the level of connection, the level of relation.
And relation doesn't have to be like 100% matching in philosophy. It's more of a, both parties can converse, both parties can articulate interactions they need to in the most interactions they want to.
They're both free to express themselves in an anxiety-free environment.
Oh, my ideas. Well, not really. It's just these ideas are abstract. I need to express into the game. It's like and do. It's just way too broad.
I can describe in the Leo, just fine. He doesn't understand. He understands it. So I've got to stop focusing on the overall explanation. No, no, no, no. I should. I should. It's just really difficult to parse.
So I shouldn't rely on using these recordings as it means to describe things. I've got to focus on the game design document, the creative design document, creative design document primarily.
But the game design document is also important. Take it by ideas. These systems are not independent. They're interwoven. They're separate for ease of comprehension. And reduce scope.
Anyway, I'm exhausted. Good night.

Instead of the typical, I mean you can still have a shower, but it's like off to the side.
And...
Tidy or drink system I suppose.
And when you have a...
...versional hot spring inside the apartment...
...you walk in and there's some little empty space, you know, the hallway or whatever.
You go and there's a little lecture space and you go down and it's like, oh wow!
There's a tub built on the floor. It's a hot tub and, really, it's a hot spring.
Let's focus on moving water and no waterfalls where like a calm flow of water.
Very quiet space.
And that to the hub.
And that to the hub.
And that to the hub.
And that to the hub.
And that to the hub.
And that to the hub.
And that to the hub.
And that to the hub.
And that to the hub.
And that to the hub.

that's difficult to articulate via text, or I'm lazy, I don't want to tape it out right now.
So, the Dyson Swarm, at some point in the future.
Let's say hypothetically at the end of the game.
The Dyson Swarm goes dark.
And the game after they've called on us, the planet after they've terraformed it to the point where it's comfortable for everyone.
It's utopia, in every sense of the word.
Anyway, you have this planet, and with new ecosystem, the light goes out, and the sun.
We see it, but we don't feel the effect for about eight minutes.
And during that time, about eight minutes, let's say it's like maybe 15 minutes, because it's colder.
Everything's too far, I don't know.
10, 12, 12 minutes, it's 12 minutes, and in that 12 minutes, this thing goes dark. People freak out.
But at the same time, the Dyson, the Jupiter-sized structure divides into two, and then it capsizes the planet, by attaching to the ring world.


# REC006.txt
How long would it take to reach the center of the Milky Way if we were traveling with
ion engines, super efficient propulsion, and it's converting the Dotaque, the Dotaque
heatrons into energy, and it has like a storage, layers and layers of storage that go on
from miles.
Imagine you have like a Jupiter-sized structure, and then the moon, the parent planet of
chion, and it's moving chion using all this energy.
But it's worth the cost, because you're moving people, you're not just moving a planet,
but you're also preserving the planet, and it takes systems and its structures, and it's
like you could preserve Earth this way.
But it's not as costly as you might imagine, due to the fact that this is a very small
percentage of the overall, of a star's overall, the exertion of energy.


# REC007.txt
The juper-size structure encapsulates when the juper-size structure encapsulates a chi-on
it emits an artificial light that's viable for life.
That's also why I need so much fuel.
Because it's emulating the surface area, it's emulating the surface area emitted by
a light from a star, from the star of the original planet.
So you have it emulating a 9-day cycle.

Okay...
I'm outside. It's been nine.
Hmm, no, it's nearly 4am.
I'm out here giving myself some time to think.
The process.
No distractions.
I am
it's
I am outside and I am that
4am and
I'm covering the blanket.
It's cold but I have
I have
a little
I have a little heater
and it cures me nice and cozy.
I'm a little hungry with that hungry but that's okay.
It's a minor distraction.
I am comfortable in the space.
I'm comfortable in the space.
I'm relaxed.
No distractions of my own head in this recorder.
The recorder is part of the distraction.
Leo will be talking again.
I'm not explaining
just to you, I'm also explaining to myself and to the people that
listen to this if anyone does.
If I do and I want to express ideas to all the other people.
It all depends on whether or not this is part of takes off and I think I will.
It's just a matter of
articulating exactly what the product is.
Having difficulty explaining this to friends.
Recorders are helping.
I'm not a boss.
Give myself the time to think.


# REC009.txt
Dodeck is a third person in an adventure game.
I don't know.
I have more thoughts there.


# REC010.txt
Okay, I'm now inside the blanket.
I'm trying to express myself with early, so stop.


# REC011.txt
Dota is a third-person inventory game within a process on character development, exploration,
and a Metroidvania-like progression system that's built around systems and language, more
dotex you unlock, more aspects of the world were able to understand due to better communication.


# REC012.txt
Yeah, it's a metaphor, but it really works. I think it's hell until I need it.
I'm content that I've expressed exactly what they do.


# REC013.txt
Okay, so Katulu here has told me something interesting, and this is an aspect of the game
I want to convey.
It's just a mental number now, where I might become more, I don't know, backwards.
Katulu has taught me something interesting about behaviour.
So, although Katulu may seem very behavioural, and they are, from that purpose, Katulu is very
behavioural.
But, it's going to be a long time.
He looks to play here, like he's doing now.
He's exploring the space and analysing it and navigating with his eyes.
And he sees prey.
So, he follows the prey with his eyes.
Now, if you just wait at the prey in front of him, he's not going to care.
And he's like, okay, I see it.
I'm good.
If it gets away, I can chase it.
He's expending the energy to reserve it.
He's hunting like a...
Oh, Kat.
So, you see it?
Hi.
There you go.
Oh, it's over here.
Oh, what is it?
Where did you go?
You hear it?
Thank you.
Oh, there it is.
Oh, it's on the chair now.
What do you do?
What do you do?
What do you do?
He just hails very fast.
Now, he's more intense.
Now, he's more intense.
Now, if they move in, they're talking.
They look to me just now.
Okay.
Oh.
So, this toy is okay.
But I think the best toy.
The toy that's more representative of a pavier.
Of his innate pavier.
Is...
That's the reason it sounds.
The laser pointer.
I rarely use this, so it doesn't get bored.
It's the best stimulation he has.
This is my negative.
So, what is that?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh, it's on the chair.
Oh, where is that?
Oh, oh, oh, where is the...
Oh, god, there it is.
That's right, it sounds.
She can park her over the hole in the whole way.
So now we're in the kitchen.
There's a lot of space.
He says he's trying to move past him.
He's keeping an eye on it.
He's very intense.
Very intense.
Where's the door now?
Okay, so what's going on with the chairs?
Over there.
Oh, that was unnatural.
Oh, he's chasing after it.
He's getting away.
He's getting scared.
He's still going to get away.
He's going to get away.
He's going back around.
It's running up the couch.
Oh, it's going back to the hallway.
Oh, it says it's moving.
Come on.
You can't.
You can't.
You can't.
You can't.
You can't.
You can't.
The good for it.
The good for it.
Good for it.
Good boy.
No, come on here.
Okay.
I want to get in the treats.
That's wonderful.
Good playtime, good playtime.
Alright, shoot.
I need to get more treats, I can add some more.
Good playtime, good playtime.

--ar 1:1 --upbeta --tile Imagine holding a small square of meta material in your hand. The surface appears almost translucent, with a subtle hint of iridescence that catches the light and reflects it back in a soft glow. Upon closer inspection, you can see that the material is composed of delicate crystalline structures that seem to shimmer in the light. The crystal lattice appears to be intricately arranged in a precise pattern, with each facet reflecting the light at a slightly different angle. As you run your fingers over the surface, you can feel a slight texture, almost imperceptible, like the surface of a finely polished gemstone. The material is lightweight yet incredibly strong, with an otherworldly beauty that seems almost too perfect to be real. You can't help but marvel at the sheer elegance of this material and can imagine it being used in high-tech applications where strength and beauty are equally important.

--ar 1:1 --upbeta --tile Imagine a flat 2D depiction or scanning technique that captures the intricate details of its crystalline structure. The material appears almost translucent, with a subtle hint of iridescence that catches the light and reflects it back in a soft glow. Looking closely, you can see delicate crystal structures arranged in a precise pattern, each facet reflecting the light at a slightly different angle. The crystal lattice is intricate and elegant, shimmering in the light like a finely polished gemstone. The material is incredibly strong yet lightweight, with an ethereal beauty that seems almost too perfect to be real. You can imagine this material being used in high-tech applications where both strength and beauty are equally important, such as aerospace engineering or architectural design.

Damn it, I had an idea, but I lost it.
I meant to know, um, put the recorder under your pillow.
And it's just a point thing.
I was thinking about conversation.
And how the player...
how they get through dialogue.
You've got to have...
the way it's set up now, it's very difficult to do anything.
It's difficult for a production.
So I was thinking...
what if instead of...
the player dominant conversation you have...
NPCs conversing, primarily.
And then the player can jump in and go down tangents.
Ask questions throughout their conversation.
This player can be a little more passive.
But he has to engage in a way that's...
hopefully interesting to them.


# REC002.txt
got it back okay so NPCs still kind of explain where you need to go and look
at the hints on how I got there or they'll give you hints of places you can go
why suppose to put another way there are no map markers or waypoints they might
describe a secret path or a round or maybe a secret or a person that you can
talk to
they'll give you directions
and if that's the player, trust the player then trust that the player will take
those directions to heart if they're addressed directly and they ask questions
come with a player direction by letting them engage it's not just one
button press, wait for dialogue, another button press, wait for dialogue, it's more like
back and forth conversation but not as quick as you would like because scope
remember the NPC is mostly talking and the player interjects they add bits of
they've got they had questions make statements during conversation let the
player express themselves you see more tangents pop up throughout giving
conversation remember it's be to run a to jump an x-drink water actually
to explode heat I should say I'll put an e-pad a
drink water from a canteen if you got it
ниar is ideas ideas
I'm interested at reading snacks or format it came I am so tired
I'd like toっ

# REC018.txt
The references aren't important, leave it open, but you want to focus on the development.
So showcase all the development thus far, and then any new reference you find, any ones
that really inspire you, throw them into a reference channel.
Actually, go back and organize references.
Use this as an incentive and grab three for each category.
Yeah, that's my goal so we can.
Three references, reach category, and then re-organize or re-disclay the development timeline.


# REC019.txt


# REC020.txt
do a half hour thing about it, it's like you're good man, just tell him you're gonna record
it when you do it, you have a problem like you can get the fuck out.
That's true.
The order's not to it, but oh, anyway I just need to make sure that I have your consent
to record.
Sure.
Okay.
That's all I need to ask really.
I don't, yeah you're right.
That was dumb.
I sure just...
Yeah, condense it down.
This is why I think it was great.
Well, cause we did this a D&D last week.
And a store...
Well, kind of recorded, you guys.
I was like, well I want to make sure I have your consent to make sure it's recorded.
Can I put this on the Internet?
Oh no, I'm not putting this on the Internet.
Expositally.
Maybe you do the terms of...
That's what I was talking about.
That's what I told you in the most.
I just want you to walk up to the table with me, sorry.
So I did just tell it's not a court either.
Hey, imagine recording the gender human conversations
and then having people,
imagining scientists, your philosophers, your artists.
Imagine...
Jordan Peterson.
Jordan Peterson.
No, no, I'm talking about people who are looking for the
store for the future.
But the lobster is...
I'm talking about scientists who are hopeful
that the world isn't going to be as bad as you think it is.
It's not going to be as terrible and dystopian as our media depicts.
No, but I mean you're definitely going to let's see some
good percentage of the population drop off here, I'm thinking.
Sure.
But I think we've seen a while ago.
20 years is one of the four speed environmental impacts
that's supposed to be felt by you.
Follow.
Follow.
Follow.
No, no, I'm thinking...
I'm thinking...
I see what you got.
Yellowstone and then you got...
Okay.
Years away from that fucking asteroid that might...
Could I destroy you from here these things?
Yeah.
Okay.
So regarding that aspect.
What else?
What else?
20 years, okay.
Nuclear war.
Sure.
Maybe.
Perhaps it's been...
You're right.
Statistically, okay, or year wise.
History wise.
It's been 50 years since World War II.
And it's been a hundred world since World War I.
Oh, but...
I am...
I think that he was like to find patterns.
And so far we haven't found an actual pattern that we found two...
Correlated events.
Because they were both tied together these wars.
And now it's been...
It was...
And now mom and...
I think we're not really obsessed with the worst of them.
Those wars are...
The generation that fought them are dead.
Yeah.
There's no war back here.
The war too is...
The generation that fought war too is gone.
I don't know.
They can't include society anymore.
They can't.
I don't think it's going to be giant landscape wars.
Like, it was back then.
It was since the advent of asymmetrical warfare.
I think it's going to be a non-state individual that causes it.
So, and it's just got enough money and guns.
Okay.
Well, let's...
Let's run down this way, then.
So...


# REC021.txt
Yeah, I mean, no one's a mustache twirling, you know, they're like, no, no, it's like,
they want their nation to succeed, they want the people to succeed, or they want themselves
to succeed.
And they don't see a nuclear war being themselves as success.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

And as long as you don't use it, but I do think the UN is pushing for the dropping of nuclear weapons, and I think that, I mean, you can trust that, here's the thing, so it sounds bizarre, but I think if you can trust the majority of nations, if the United States can put away their arms, put it lock away, I mean, secrets, secrets, secrets are hard to catch.
The longer, the longer the longer, the longer the longer the longer there, the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer you think the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer the longer
down you activate the second stage and slam it as old as you can if you're told
it that's the new thing we're doing we're like nukes they have radiation this
can level a block you know bad side effects okay it's scary it's called
rot of dawn oh it is a giant pretty much graphite rod
sides of a telephone pool they want to show it's not a nuke it so that's
that's that's that's it's it's it's it's it's it's a kinetic missile that's
fucking terrifying okay they're throwing a rod into the ground that's also
terrifying but it's it's really cool for sci-fi but I don't think we'll
have a world I won't have won't have it I'm or we have a space whose
kinetic missiles are probably the best bands me the defense is coming in a
missile is a giant almost it's not a missile it's not a missile you're throwing a
fucking rock this is what you throw in a rocket high-speed net open the
rocket the rocket's rockets but no that's what the new toy is and then rushes
you sky full and it's pretty scary it shoots itself up into the air then stops
and then just let itself glide and then it has a second engine in case you
shoot at it it can move out of the way you want some fucking fire we're seeing
like


# REC022.txt
Oh shit, look how it's died.
Everyone look up.
That's the last pretty thing we're gonna see in your fucking life.
I don't know. I'm not stopping here.
I'm stopping here myself.
Oh yeah, like depending on how old we hit,
we can contain the damage for a block.
It's like a city.
It's like...
Well, what the city find the phone like...
What were your other coins, Tristan?
You had okay, we had...
You had numerous rewards up as potential means if you just stop here.
You had a few other deals.
This isn't fraudulent.
I think we could definitely overcome that situation.
I'm down for a...
You even know who we're having.
Yeah, and I don't think it is like that happened on time soon.
No, the closest thing.
A couple of years ago.
Yeah, so the only thing I don't get excited is if it goes off and could survive it.
But it cripples us for a few years for our travel.
Oh, that's on the point on me.
Okay, so you're right, you're right.
We could cripple for a while.
We could cripple for a long time.
It's like the ship of the Matrix with the robots of Arkansas.
But the Matrix with the robots of Arkansas.
You can farm for 10 years.
Well, in what situation?
In the nuclear war?
Or the blister missiles?
Because you said the blister missiles were more...
When the other stuff goes off...
This game shows off publicly.
Your rock particles are going to make...
So you can't play jazz, can't play helicopter.
Ironically, it sounds...
I think that that situation could kind of make us travel towards space and survive up there too.
Yeah, but you're talking millions down a salvation before that happens.
No, no, that's...
You see, you know, it's still there?
Yeah.
Humans are in turmoil, but they survived, we persisted.
Yeah, but so if Yellowstone goes off...
We have stores and stores of food is just a matter of...
No, so it's not about the food is about getting at the places.
If Yellowstone goes off...
We already have groceries.
We already have grocery systems.
We just make food a little more expensive.
So, no, the way that food works is...
We grow most of it in half the country.
And then we ship it outwards.
And the other half is where we do all the manufactures.
So the states that have the food and the states need a bottle of wine.
So we get that state to die off.
And then you're talking about Appalachia's gone.
Porta Velazka, Dreamland.
Pretty much if you don't have a road leading to town, you're going to still get this.
Let me ask some real quick.
Just ask Google or something.
What?
You can ask Google.
You're not going there.
The only thing that Google is going to expect you to sell out the planet.
You think she'd answer.
She'll answer.
Okay.
One is the next expected ice age.
A new model that predicts the solar cycles more accurately than ever before has suggested
that solar magnetic activity will drop by 60% between 2030 and 2040,
which means in just 15 years' time, Earth could sink into what researchers are calling a mini ice age.
Mini ice age.
Because of the global warming.
There's two questions.
There's two questions.
Yeah.
It's a natural way of cooling itself.
Yeah.
It is.
But we made it, we made it unable to cool itself further.
We even heard a theory that that's why it's our last polar ship with a beautiful global warming
because the ice caps melted into the end.
That's what's stabilizing on the Earth.
The wall was right.
That's what's stabilizing.
It's on a solid wall.
So if it doesn't have that weight at the point, it's going to have...
And there's also...
It's an interest.
Because it's a predictable rate, right?
The planet...
We can predict the movement of the planet.
And moving the planet correlates with this age too.
So it's like there are multiple factors.
There are multiple variables affecting this outcome.
And global warming is one of them.
It's just people somehow believe that this is not a natural formality.
It is natural, but it's also human control.
What about the Sun?
It's natural.
They're just speeding it up.
Yeah, we're speeding it up.
What about the Sun getting off one of those cups?
Huh?
Did you get that protocol?
Oh my god.
The fucking fighter can think.
It was the Sun gives off what a constant things it in the space.
My friend, please know.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
It's a light wall.
It's a fake LED light wall.
Oh, these walls are similarly compatible for us.
Right.
And then it gets better.
It removes now fake.
Again.
Is this the Jesus time?
Oh no, no.
It's kind of like cottage cheese.
No, no.
The trip was real.
And then they went back and actually proved it was a fake object trying to do it by us.
Yeah, now it's getting fun.
And again, so the glass dome we found it.
But inside it is the fountain.
It was censored by the giant bit.
It's just...
Oh my god.
Oh well.
That's why it costs so much to go to the altar.
It's not the supplies.
We're trying to make it so people can afford to go there.
Jesus Christ.
No.
No expensive.
Is it going to be arctic?
Probably pretty expensive.
It's pretty good.
That's when you have no crops.
That's when you have no consistent supply of food.
You've got to bring it all with you.
See, they think it should be like...
Oh, it's resources.
It's all a place of the gold lining, though.
That'd be the best.
That's why you don't try to territory into that fucking thick layer.
It's not just that.
So in the altar, when the glacier is left, the water will flow back.
So I don't use any minerals that they've done to travel it.
It went back.
So it's these two giant golden pots full of shit.
But the problem is, as I said, when we hit the drill bit, if we're not ready, the drill can shadow.
If it gets too hot, we don't even have the temp as it's drilling in.
Because the stress of it getting so cold and then building up friction from the drilling.
And we, in the middle of making the drill, it's so shadowy in the pieces.
You get people getting frostbite, because they forget to go up.
And they accidentally touch a door handle on the outside.
It's probably going to go fashionally.
That's how it dies, man.
So the cool thing about dynamite is when it sweats and makes nitro.
And even though the temperatures...
So if you get nitros and wet,
well, you get it cold and heated up in a generous moisture.
The base ingredient for dynamite is nitro listen.
It's the M and T and T.
It would be better than a drill would be a laser cutter.
But trying to get the kind of mass of tow truck to just ram that thing out.
Right now, the biggest issue is we can get the laser though.
Or if you can melt it and get a hose to drain the water.
Yeah.
So right now, the biggest issue is we can get machines there.
But the people that will put it in the walk that it died to for the machines break.
Yeah.
It's rather...
It's too cold.
It's too cold, honestly.
Yeah, and then we have people going insane from the isolation.
We had one incident where recently a scientist had another,
because it kept spoiling,
but it's not enough funding or interest in it then.
Those were easily fixed problems.
Yeah.
No, what you really need to do is just see.
See many mining corporations going after the easy money,
of the proven method.
No one wants to do the most of the method that might not pay.
I was no archaeologist out there,
and I really cared.
Nothing's been dug up there, everything.
Yeah, I think it says ice and so.
Okay, so we're not doomed.
Right, so we're not...
The ice age of coming is not going to be ice severe.
I think it is because it won't work.
No, I think it's going to be a little...
We could survive it with a little more...
It depends on how worried about human stupidity.
It depends on how they say ice age.
It depends on what's going to help us out in the end.
It depends on what they mean by ice age,
because humans are very liberal when it comes to that phrase.
That this is many ice age.
Yeah, but depending on what the science group is using it,
that could mean...
No, but we also do this because it's in temp,
or they could mean the actual ice age itself.
The ice age just happened periodically, right?
Or they...
Yeah, you're right.
It could be the one.
I don't know.
But I am presuming...
I'm assuming it's a temp drop.
Yeah.
Okay.
Anyway, I think if I...
Sex is working.
Yeah, and about it here,
probably being more like a lask at that point.
Well, we were actually the best part of the weather goes to shit.
We were like in the middle, dude.
My one was just texted at the oceans.
Yeah, we were like, I get flooded, for sure.
Well, the biggest thing is we just might get a touch more wind,
which would suck.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
It's already bad out there where I'm living.
The fucking random sandstorms are fun.
I don't know that.
Well, the dustbin was used to be cool out there in the slides.
Hmm.
About the stage of coach.
Okay.
You drive past it probably every day.
About a year ago.
You drive through a recession.
Now, have you guys seen...
Kirk is out in a nutshell?
What now?
Kirk is out in a nutshell.
You've probably seen their video on the population.
I'm sure it's real quick.
They're really good at this kind of thing.
Kirk is out in a nutshell.
Oh, okay.
In a nutshell.
So, the issue is you've got to figure out what is paying you.
Figure out what you've got to select another.
It seems their source of insight.
No one in the scientific community is overly expressed at these issues.
It's scientific.
Never before in history have there been so many people on earth as right now.
Our numbers have not broken down yet.
From seven and a half and 1,800 is already to 2.3 billion in 1914.
3.7 billion in 1970.
And 7.4 billion in 2016.
The world population had increased fourfold in the last century.
So, what can we expect for the next century?
And what does population growth mean for our future?
Will there be mass migration, over crowded slums,
and megacities covering concerts, diseases of pollution,
chaos and violence of energy, water and food,
and the human species focused on the arms sustaining itself?
Will population growth destroy our lives?
Or is this prophecy turning into an underground dynamic?
I don't know.
I'm going to call it an war, or a revive.
What's funny about that?
It's just, in the education exists right now,
since we are reaching to the unprecedented rate,
which led to the monolithic prophecies.
The poor would pro-creat endlessly
and overrun the development world,
the legend of overpopulation.
There are a lot of other people left by dabbing with them.
It turns out high birth rates in the population explosion
are not permanent features of some cultures or countries,
and rather part of a four-step process,
the whole world is going through the demographic transition.
Most developed countries have already made the transition,
while other countries aren't doing it right now.
Let's go back to the 18th century
when the entire world, including Europe,
was in the first stage of the development transition.
By today's standards, Europe was worse off the late developing region,
suffering from all sanitation,
or diets, and more medicine.
Sounds like L.A. right now.
So most of the diets just as fast,
so the population hardly grew.
Women have between four and six children,
and only two of them would reach out to the right now,
but again, the indigenous population,
and the UK, and more of the greatest change in human-emic conditions
is still in their control within this power,
and they may run from being essence to work and screening.
Manufactured goods were mass produced,
and became widely available.
The scientists flourished,
and advanced transportation, communication,
and the other medicine.
The role of women in society shifted,
and created the conditions for their emancipation.
Slowly, this economic progress not only formed a middle class, but also raised standards of living and healthcare for the poor working population.
The second transition stage started.
Better food supplies, hygiene and medicine meant people stopped dying all the time, especially so at a very young age.
The result was a population explosion, doubling the UK's population between 1715 and 1850.
The main reason families used to have lots of children was that only a few of them wanted to survive.
Now that had changed, so the third stage of the transition was a population of a few of them.
But it's only for the disabled and population groups.
Eventually, the balance emerged.
Few people were dying and fewer children were born, so the death rate and birth rate became stable.
Britain had reached the fourth stage of the demographic transition.
This didn't only happen in the UK.
More and more countries went through the fourth stages.
First, many births and many deaths due to bad living conditions.
Second, the best living conditions leading to fewer deaths and a population explosion.
Third, fewer deaths resulting in fewer births and population growth came to an end.
Why is the population so low?
7 billion, maybe 10 billion.
The population explosion of the 70's is not having kids themselves now.
I'm not so sorry about that.
I'm not so sorry about that.
I'm not so sorry about that.
Definitely.
So we're fine.
But the people coming up are going to run into some sort of news.
I'm wondering what I have these people are going to do.
Maybe if we persisted to do.
But I think that if we persist, if we continue to pursue crops that are easier produced with less resources.
I don't mean like food and meat grown through cellular growth.
I mean, instead of through animal workers.
It's like helium.
Nitrogen.
So helium, we're running out of this whole room and all.
Helium 3.
I think we can break it down.
We're running out of helium.
So it was the thing.
We've never brought anything back.
Some亣dam but samples, we don't have – we don't take shit back if last.
It's against the quality policies we have in place.
That currently anything, we've never successfully mine and rather anything back in the moment.
I mean, if we build the intro, if we imagine Spark the idea, he might have been mind the moon.
Well, that's a tell, I like that.
They're not.
We don't need the moon.
We don't need the moon.
It looks pretty.
But it's a natural resource we need to.
There's no life there.
There's no reason we've got to stop being so...
What do you call it?
Sentimental.
Sentimental.
We can't work here.
The earth is not unique.
There's no special.
I mean, the gorgias here are.
But the rock we live on is not special.
We can produce more rocks like it with the species that we have.
We can make these second earths.
Third earths.
We can make these second earths.
Third earths.
We can make these second earths.
Third earths.
We can make these second earths.
Third earths.
We can make these second earths.
Third earths.
We can make these second earths.
Third earths.
We can make these second earths.
Third earths.
We can make these second earths.
We're not going to...
Well, I've got to read the ocean since you were saying.
Oh, if I can't get everything I want done by then.
What if we found an earth that was a hundred times bigger?
We would throw the land on it.
We could.
But would we just be crushed?
I was trying to say about this the only day.
So, it may be worth depends on the gravity.
It would be so heavy that we would just...
That's the thing.
It would depend on the strength of the gravity of the planet.
So, we should be able to get there.
Right.
Now, it would depend on if it has the same system as others.
Because if it does, then all we would have to do is take what all gravity is.
And times about a hundred if we did that, we'd die.
Yeah.
We'd be crushed.
So, you've got to find a plan at the right size.
Right atmosphere.
Right size.
Right atmosphere.
Right distance.
Right speed.
Because in the terraforming, it's pretty much the best option there.
You've got to figure that out.
Because final dynamics.
We actually found out that if you nuke sold in spots,
it can trigger the impact that we think will evaporate the water.
Yeah.
It would start the atmosphere process.
At least that's a whole thing.
Although it is looking for a reason to shoot off a bunch of these nukes.
Pretty far-fetched, but yeah.
I mean, shit.
So, it was the thing about helicopter,
but we were not under the energy made one.
True.
He never would thought he was fucking insane,
but he wrote it down anyway.
All right.
Here's a question.
What's your thought about the genius there?
Hm?
Monthly.
So, for every great invention,
before we went the internet,
but before electricity,
gasoline,
there's, like, these really landmark achievements.
We find that those always two people
that came up with the idea,
or versions of it.
Now, it's probably just a bunch of,
will you consider this evolution?
But, when you talk to alien people,
they theorize that those are guardians of alien-seeding ideas.
Hm?
You see what fucking insane,
whether they're fun to talk to,
they believe it was slave species,
which is a science product.
That the Egyptian gods are actually the scientists.
Yeah, that works.
Definitely.
It should look like that.
Yeah, now, do the fun talk to you?
Do they think of the hieroglyphics
or representations of the science experiments conducted
by putting human and animals together
by this alien race?
Hm?
The proof is that the Egyptians claim
that those gods bleed gold instead of blood.
So, yeah, it's an ancient civilization that,
that's like, basically, they were,
that was their AI.
Yeah, they've gone.
They came in,
those dust and slave label judges,
used dust and slave label,
did all they wanted,
and then,
and then, they left,
and we broke free,
they're not true about that pulpit.
Hm?
Yeah, it's just some crazy shit
that they link to the Bible.
It is funny that there's a dust like this though,
I think these like live redo to live.
They're still around,
they used,
and then, I'll give you just a second,
text for 20 text,
but I guess,
not?
Yeah.
I don't,
maybe you have no primary sources on that.
It's all long gone.
Yeah, it's all spent on that.
The triplets thing that I find
is the cave paintings coming out
in Africa I believe. Well there's no moon in them. But later generations of the moon. That's the
actual excuse. Aliens brought it here. Yeah, John Leroy saved you like that. I mean we have a
more into the solar system. You guys can't imagine that our planet gets affected by a large
object too? No so like this. So this is the theory from these people. So according to the translation
of the message, which hasn't been gratified because we don't speak the language anymore.
It's a pictograph language. This dude's translation is a lizard race brought the moon to us,
came down and joined us and said how those ship was broke so they have to live with us now.


# REC023.txt
but it's broke. Speaking of moon, do you know what the roach limit is? This is really cool.
The roach limit. You know what it is? Okay. Cool. So let me explain it. So the moon,
I'll just explain it in an abstract concept. You're in a more of a red cone way.
So the planet itself and the moon, if the moon gets too close,
it's not going to hit the planet, it'll actually hit the roach limit.
And what the roach limit does is that it pulls apart the moon using centrifugal forces.
The pull apart does it, the reaction of the earth's been used to it, and the moon's been used to it.
It's like, you have like, yeah, it's like you're fucking, the moon gets destroyed in terms of the ring.
So then what if you can use that ring? What if you could defend the earth, right?
From the impacts that are coming. Using glist of missiles or whatever.
We can have a lot easier to mind that shit, huh?
Imagine that. Imagine if we can destroy the rocks as they're incoming,
but we can collect them with a collector that's off the planet.
That's also meant to, oh my god.
Do we know for sure that there's value?
Hey, why haven't we noticed yet? Why haven't we made like a net and kind of thrust down,
how the hell didn't the lower atmosphere and thrust downward?
We built a net over the planet out of a super affordable, durable material
that can grapple on their objects. It can be electromagnetic.
You can make it a electromagnetic net.
Yeah, and we can catch all the minerals needed, but it might have to be a tangible net too.
It means the metal.
Yeah, dude, it'd be perfect.
We collect all the materials, all the debris that's circulating in the system,
and we can also collect all the moon dust that we create by bringing the bright,
by bringing the moon closer.
Those ships are actually running right now.
They're making good progress.
Humanity is not excited enough to explore the moon anyway.
That's weird. I won't blow it up with that.
I won't blow it up with that.
It's like, holy shit, that's cool.
I want that net. That'd be amazing.
Oh, I hate it.
You can set it up.
You could hypothetically detonate the bigger pieces that survive the roach limit, breakage.
Don't worry about it. Let's just go there now.
Go to the center, pack a shit tunnel.
Well, go as deep as we can.
Pack a shit tunnel and expose a lot of it so it's facing the middle of the way.
You can be fucking fun, dude.
You can wait for a full moon, right?
Watch like 10 nukes in one spot and just fucking shit.
You're like, I was thinking about that a lot.
You can see a few of you guys.
Look cities that don't pay.
Just take his net out here.
They just have helicopters involved.
This red neck entertainment in space, dude.
That's what I'm talking about.
That's what I'm talking about.
That's what I'm talking about.
That's what I'm talking about.
That's what I'm talking about.
That's what I'm talking about.
That's what I'm talking about.
That's what I'm talking about.
That's what I'm talking about.
That's what I'm talking about.
That's what I'm talking about.
That's what I'm talking about.
That's what I'm talking about.


# REC024.txt
Imagine this. Imagine you have in the future. Imagine you have the earth encircled by this and that.
You had the net pushing outwards collecting all the debris at the moon, but at the same time...
You could synchronize that with each point of satellite, which would be...
Oh my god, it's a great idea. That way you have... like Elon's most satellites, right?
But they're not satellites, they're actually...
There's a lot lower flight satellites than that.
But then you need tethers that go outwards to keep the net in place.
Yeah, like a grid. And you have the tethers...
It's kind of like a polygon grid.
Yeah, yeah. But then that's a good analogy. It's a visual example of that.
I'm trying to imagine it, and you have a circular polygon grid.
It is a collection... it collects debris. It creates satellite points that actually...
Or fix satellite points.
And then you have...
It fills out you're not disconnected from the others.
That's it.
Wow, okay.
Fuck cell phones, fuck...
And this is the ultimate internet.
This is the ultimate connection.
No, you wouldn't need phone services then, like Verizon or shit, because you just get it from that.
Yeah, you didn't... the net that we're using actually...
Okay, so imagine this net is below the roast limit.
Right, it's not going to affect it.
But then you have this...
That's true.
But then you have... just in case it gets stuck part of the damage.
You have to push it, and then it's re-verified or real, by the way.
This is all I selected for this interpretation.


# REC025.txt
Yesterday, actually, I work.
Um, or today.
So the opening scene for him, I wanted to be dealing with his hands, perhaps, in front of him.
But I wanted to figure out...
So imagine the E.I, right?
Have you seen...
It is, it is...
Okay, that's the movement?
Yeah, that's probably a good...
At the beginning.
You saw the reference.
The white body, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
But imagine it having holes, imagining it being...
Way too efficient, too.
You don't need all that machinery, right?
No, no.
You don't need all the empty space.
Like humans have.
You can make these...
You can make these almost like...
Almost like super low-estor genomes.
Imagine like a...
A last scene...
A last scene that I had...
A structure about...
Yeah, but those are clunky, right?
There's no other than the new one that they have.
It has a...
Defined chest piece.
Yeah, like...
Oh, oh!
And then the legs and the bones will come off and the less material, but the chest piece is super-defined.
Imagine you have...
You have a shape like that, but it's a little more triangular.
Okay.
So it's like a humanoid formula.
So it's close to...
But it doesn't have a joint body.
It doesn't have like...
It has tubes...
Okay.
It doesn't have like an internal structure.
Yeah.
Or does, but there are...
Maybe it's like a chest piece structure.
It's not like those are holes.
It's a magic...
Yeah.
But imagine that you have chest piece here.
This is like...
There are...
There are organs, all the processing stuff.
And they're head.
So you have the dough deck inside the head of the brain.
Is that a human shape?
But the dough deck inside the brain?
Inside the head of the structure.
Is that good?
Is that good?
Is that good?
Yeah.
The neck.
So...
For the broken dough deck, like a piece, I want to ask you...
Does the piece look like normal dough decks?
Does it look like normal dough decks?
It's white.
There's...
It has white surface, yeah.
So it's white, not bad.
Yeah.
It's...
When it...
It's like raised out.
As it loses energy, it raised out.
Yeah.
Well, I'm talking about the ones that...
Because I want...
Isn't those two that they have to connect to the form of the piece?
Is that why they're going to do ones that they need to combine them for a puzzle or something?
Because we're talking about having the unique pieces of the dough deck puzzle that they needed.
But they didn't realize that there were more than one piece still.
But I don't know if you want to do that.
Because it was before we had the protocol.
So I think...
You've had the idea of having the keys, right?
Yeah.
You wanted to put them on the door of the structure.
You want to put them on like...
This is the data storage of humanity.
You can...
It's pretty grave, really.
It's up there.
It's up there.
People...
There are keys, but they're also information.
Well, it's trying to...
Okay, sir.
No, it's...
Energy.
Energy is the basic dough deck that I could use.
But before I start any more describing it, I want to know what it actually is.
Because when we came up with this idea, we didn't have a description except for it's a dough deck.
So does it look like a conventional dough deck?
Or is there a uniqueness to it?
It is a conventional dough deck.
Okay.
So the mathematical sense.
But it feels the same.
It feels the same.
Yeah.
Appearance wise.
Okay.
It looks good, though.
Because it's...
I don't think I'm ready with for him.
It's...
Hey, man, this team thinks it's broken.
But...
So what I'm thinking here, that's the point.
So...
What if it's...
It's a perfect structure.
It's dense as any object can be.
Because it's so dense, you can't actually cut your hand to cut your hand to touch again.
No, it's not that sharp.
It's not that precise.
Well, no, no.
But it's not...
It's...
It's curved with the edges.
Yeah.
Is this just...
No, maybe it may be sharp edges.
Well, no.
It's not about like that.
I was just trying to...
So I imagine that they have a dough deck.
But I was trying to figure out...
Is there something that sets it apart from the other dough deck?
So there's a little bit of the other dough deck.
Hmm.
Like, is there...
No big...
Look, these are specials that we don't understand.
What sort of each dough deck has an emotion?
Not an emotion, as I...
As I...
As I treat...
As one of those...
12 traits.
Oh, it has...
These two, right?
Okay, so there's...
I imagine a strison.
Hmm.
So, um...
Oh.
Hang on.
Let me try...
Try and stay on this.
Because one kind of figure out is...
Imagine...
He's got the dough deck.
Did you see the symbols?
In the...
In the...
In the...
In the feed?
The feed for, uh...
A bread of nymphs.
The, uh...
This word...
I did that.
Oh, it's a...
I guess that...
And the boring line.
Okay.
Oh, okay, that was done.
That's what we had.
So...
But yeah, so...
These here, we have...
Aggression.
Apprehension.
Misery.
Elation.
Aversion.
Attraction.
Pain.
Pleasure.
Shame.
Bride.
Uh, it wasn't only, oh, it was, um...
In the...
In the...
In the enmity.
In the enmity.
In the empathy.
In the middle of the hair, you have...
It's a...
It's a...
It's a gradient of human expression.
And now, if human expression is shown in the face,
a lot of it's shown on...
Your...
Your language...
Through the tone of voice.
Through the internal processes in the back of your mind,
you're not expressed in others.
Uh, they're not necessarily strict.
They're not strictly taught.
This is more of an abstraction.
But, uh, this is...
A little gradient.
Yeah.
So, um...
And then, contentness, or being content,
is in the center.
But also in the center, there is...
The fashion.
Oh, okay, yeah.
And then, the only issue is really content,
or...
Potentially depressed if you're not getting the social aspect of the film.
I'm not contenting the social aspect, I don't know.
Well, because I'm trying to figure out
if there's a reason these singlet up is their deck.
Because I know what I'm currently running with is...
Let's say, oh, in.
It looks like the other dodecks.
Okay.
So, imagine this works for all intents and books.
Imagine all dodecks.
Book, book.
Imagine all dodecks can have 12 faces,
with the symbols on them.
Yeah.
But a lot of them want to have one.
Do you have promotions?
You have these AI
that can't really express anything with one.
Maybe two, they can start to talk a little bit, like babies.
Right?
They can interact with some dodecks.
They can make peaks and whistles.
But then you have stage three in that screen occasion.
But these are still still pictures and whistles,
but a lot more advanced.
Because I got to keep the scope small.
Yeah.
I get just to keep it a little more abstract.
I'll show you how to...
I'll show you how to keep the most...
Because those advanced beeps will sound like...
But you have these steps of language,
these steps of communication,
and that the expression of dodecks,
probably the best expression.
But it doesn't mean full fulfillment.
The fulfillment is different from just progression
and locking more spheres, more and more.
I guess no one kind of does.
Because you are getting aptitude
in the native end direction.
That would be the explanation.
So...
Who is the fourth description of a devil like I did?
What are these...
Do you imagine the symbols here?
Do you want to show it before, right?
Did I...
Did I explain this to you?
I had it all.
No, I don't think so.
The last one, the last one, the last one is...
Oh.
Let's use this one.
This one's good.
That's the last one I have to do, right?
Try these yourself, or...
I got an artist.
Mission them.
Wow, that's loud.
I'm coughing in the mic.
I've got so many years later.
Well, because I know what a...
What's going on around me is...
All the tens of focuses that dodecks they have
should work.
But they can't figure out why it doesn't work.
These are the dodecks, so energy and information.
They are information, but also energy and things.
These are the dodecks, so energy and information are correct.
They are information, but also energy and things.
They are equals something squared, they are.
Yeah.
Equal power energy, and...
Well, if they will kind of like a data chip.
Dense structures.
I was going to have it be like a data chip.
You can store stuff on them, but they produce this energy also,
so you don't have to use it for one of the other.
You can use it for both.
Well, at least because you said the symbols are incorrect.
You know, I think...
Well, imagine them being processors, right?
CPUs, they're the most powerful things you can ever imagine,
but they're not AI.
They don't believe in the AI, but they can become AI.
Because they're so dense, because these structures are so granular.
The brain...
Yeah, one thing can become a brain.
One of these things.
But they're really just...
How do they react?
They...
At first, they react like a little animal, you know,
they're running around.
I mean...
Imagine at first they're...
They're more of a dog or cat.
No, no.
In terms of movement.
They're more of a...
They're mobile.
They can change their form.
They can change their form.
They can be a big dog, like structure or a...
A monkey-like structure, you know.
But they can't be large enough.
They can't be...
They can't be advanced enough to be fully aware.
Like, human.
Or fully advanced, like, human.
But they're not...
But humans aren't even fully advanced enough.
They're not fully done.
Keep going.
Because they're not...
So what I was writing with is,
he's got the dough deck in the lab.
They don't know why it's not...
Doing anything.
It's just sitting there.
It gives off energy, like, it should work.
But it's not interacting, like, as the other dough decks would interact.
And so that's why I...
So, dude...
Imagine, okay, that's interesting.
Okay, let's say it's tier...
Tier 3, tier 4.
That's the basic...
The basic human.
They're social.
And they're...
They're expression.
In the...
Aggression and anxiety.
Fasats.
Or multiple.
Maybe it's like five or six.
I don't know how many it takes to be...
Basic human, do you think?
Sorry.
No problem.
I'm just doing it.
Without...
Okay, imagine...
Okay, just for clarification.
For...
Let's look at this.
Imagine these structures are...
You were grabbing 12 at the time, right?
That was 12, right?
I bet that's it.
They're not eight right now.
I need any four more.
They're not expressed here.
But, uh, it's a dough deck.
No, no, excuse me.
It was 103, it said...
I know that.
Yeah, and then you have...
Exactly.
And you're only on lock one at a time.
But...
What do you mean what do you own lock?
Unlock is in, like, uh...
Imagine the AI could get more advanced.
It's not like a baby, right?
Okay, so...
It's a little scratch.
It's a zero from one that you got to...
A fully human expression.
So the dough deck still has...
So it's also a stationary object.
And then, as you slowly interact with it,
it still leads to the most normal.
Yeah.
Okay.
So I didn't realize that they were going to have a side
with a moving.
I thought this was a truly stationary object.
Uh, it is at first,
but then it advances...
It's a mold building.
And then...
Expression.
So fully...
No, I can use that then to explain why they have it.
Yeah.
So there's, like, an AI version of it.
Like, a full lot of humanoid kind of thing.
And that's the thing with the line of scissors, right?
The tubular structures in the body.
Well, because I was trying to figure out,
what is this problem of understanding the dough deck
before I get to that scene?
They say that they may wear these things there,
they don't know how they exist,
they don't know how they became these machines.
Because they're so long.
So it's not very different...
What about you in the years?
Almost planet.
And they believe that...
Huh?
So you said the easiest things for energy,
is that all they do is...
The easiest things?
The ones that are not formed yet,
are used for energy.
And...
Because these things are not functional.
They...
They're...
I gotta get a question,
from these dough deck machines towards the people there,
using those things that do mean that it's fine.
That it is fine.
They're not going to rage over it.
I think that's how they become,
because they're locking these spaces,
they grow into humans,
they get to socialize,
they get to interact with you.
So because they lock it in,
they can get to experience,
and they experience them in some locks.
Yeah.
They take through experience,
they become more human.
They become more AI that learn,
that teach themselves how to be more naturalistic.
Okay.
I'm good then.
That's so embarrassing to be honest.
I needed to explain why is he looking at this door?
I didn't want to talk to the reason it had to be her own.
Because I'm trying to figure out why I'm here.
I'm here for the half of this door deck.
I still have the new book on the right.
I spent a few people less.
There's a lot.
So how many of these non-walking dodecks will we get?
How many things should be on the door?
How many things are interesting?
Are there 12 side dodecks?
Are there 12 side dodecks?
Are there 36 or 50 or 100?
Let's say there's 12 in the door.
Let's say there's multiple.
What's another interesting number?
Not 42.
If you have 72?
You have 12.
12 symbols.
You have 12 sides.
What is the common denominator?
What do you call it?
There are prime numbers, right?
What is the prime number of 12?
I feel cool.
Okay, that's...
What we're talking about is we don't want to make it too complex,
but we don't want to make it too easy.
We don't want to make it too trophy.
What is the prime number of 12?
Something that's avoided the prime number of 12.
According to the math form,
however, 12 is not a prime number
because one asterisk 12 equals 12,
two asterisk 6 equals 12,
and three asterisk 4 equals 12.
Prime factorization means finding all the prime numbers
that are factors of a number.
Two, if the last digit is even,
the number is divisible by two.
Okay, so, all right, that's bad at all.
So, here's something, man.
How many of the out of the 12 symbols,
would you say, one of the most known ones
that you absolutely need?
Absolutely need.
So, because these are behaviors,
I think that interaction takes aggression anxiety.
Like in a cat or a dog, there is, you know,
the hiss, anxious,
they can get it.
Well, they need to talk about a lot,
fight them more like a puzzle.
The thing is, he's in the low aggression,
low anxiety state.
He is calm.
He's in between.
Well, because how many doors are there,
just the one that they found?
There are four doors on each structure.
So, when it's entered to build the entire city
all the way around.
Okay.
And then you have, maybe, maybe six.
Well, also, if you do six doors on the structure,
then I would, when I recommend,
is breaking it down through to a door.
It had to be that those in arrangement,
they have to figure out,
for all six structures.
Oh, that's big of it.
Oh, that's big of it.
Each door, as you said, those four doors.
Yeah.
Those 12 symbols.
So, you put three to each door.
You have to have each door a lineup of the other ones,
kind of, I guess, your dog proposal about the emotional thing.
And somehow you have to figure out the message
that it's conveying to you inside.
That's a really, oh my god, it's like a Metroidvania.
It's like, instead of, like, unlocking doors
to unlock the next area,
you're unlocking doors to the next section of the world.
Imagine going beyond the walls.
Well, saying it, but you don't need to do a puzzle that way.
You could just have it be that it's a message
that they're coding, not a stupid puzzle.
This is the puzzle you're trying to develop in your game,
because I came into conversation late.
Yeah, those look like concepts for the destinies.
Oh, so,
this is a stuff I have kind of large to do.
All right.
That was level concepts.
Yeah, it's a hub world concept.
It's a hub world concept.
Meaning Chris, I'm trying to help him flesh out the board
a little more with detail,
kind of like, concept writing.
Right, I mean, yeah.
So what I'm doing here is I'm doing, you know,
still a little five to six out of the screenplay,
soft with snippets and information he's giving me.
So we can do a dry run to see if it flows naturally.
He's having to vote characters.
Because a lot of it is character interaction.
And so we want to see if the interaction
he has in mind.
So a physical one is we're doing that.
We're using these interactions to flesh out the details
about the character.
So Leo, I want to pitch this to you, okay?


# REC026.txt
Well, I know, but I wanted to give you an idea of how I wanted to do this.
So, in a way that's articulate, because I've had a really hard time explaining this to friends, because it's complex.
Hopefully, in person it helps.
So, imagine that during conversation.
It's not just a text box, you want to add that to a tree, right?
No, no, no, it's more of...
You have...
Okay, so for production wise, there are two characters, two actors, two scientists, two philosophers, two artists, whatever.
They're talking and communicating, right, to each other.
But then, I record the entire conversation.
They're in the entire conversation, but then I let the player, or like you, or let me ask questions from that conversation, like commentary to it, really.
And then you present those questions to the people that talk, and they give you tangents.
They give you the next layer of information, and then you can ask...
Yeah, based on your questions.
And then you add another layer of questions, and then you do it again.
And then you clarify to the precise degree that someone should communicate.
If you have, get a shot, try out a wolf.
I like the chat system.
I'm not there yet, but I will.
I bought it. I haven't played it yet.
I want to call it your first.
When I talk to the AI, I found out that those whole questions I could unlock just by if I keep talking and paying attention to the AI.
So I interacted with a bunch of people.
This is the fourth mission in town.
I had the choice of just any mission.
But as I talked to them, you find out that they're cutting the food with extra shit because they don't have enough fish.
All they eat this fish, and it doesn't play now.
And I found this out talking to some random sidekick.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
And then I had a choice.
I could completely ignore the food issue.
And while I could talk to him, go, hey, why are you people getting sick?
Because I found a golden.
And if you found the golden, and then you talk to me, you can mention I found a golden.
We can use their food.
But then you find out he has a rivalry with that lady.
And you can actually convince that dude, because he wants to see what it succeeds like.
If you leave, she'll bring her food.
You can actually convince this guy to leave the town, because this guy is going to bring her food.
Leo, could you come up with a story like that, but for this world?
Like, so you're going to be at the end.
The issue is going to be the AI.
Okay.
And then those social adversaries are going to have to figure out a lot more.
Because literally all we have for those social adversaries is some greetings, the family make up.
And then we have some side interaction.
And we have to figure out how do they react to stressful events?
Motivations will like, why would they even be stressful?
Because you said that they don't really have a need for currency.
Yeah, there's no currency.
There's no vehicles.
People that be social, these close-knit social spaces.
Imagine that you're...
Violent is very minimal violence, minimal stealing, rape murder, whatever it is.
Yeah, it's utopian in the literal sense.
But there's also small issues.
It's not perfect.
And that's why it hasn't been fully filled out.
When you have that kind of civilization, it's not like a prime directive to me.
Think of a stole check.
Because you're all helping.
You're giving information, you're giving them cross-bar energy at the same time.
But think of stole check.
They didn't really have a whole lot of internal conflict.
It wasn't brought down outside species.
Your biggest issues, you limited yourself to two species.
Yeah, no, they're not.
Oh geez.
Do I want to spoil it?
Christian?
I don't know if I want to spoil it.
Christian.
Can you probably get a forget all the shit that the game comes out of?
Yeah, deep.
Do you want another spoiler or do you want to...
All right, I go for it.
Okay, I don't even know what to throw.
All right.
He's already alive.
Okay, okay.
You're right.
Jump into the middle.
It's just a man.
You can still find awe in this.
Oh, you're giving me the ending base.
I'm giving the ending.
Okay.
No, that's good.
You need an ending.
Okay.
So...
The AI.
They are not avalians.
They are of humanity.
The colonies that arrived here found these structures.
They were curious.
They were amazed.
They were awestruck by them.
They tried to figure out what they were.
Couldn't find a means to get inside the structures.
Couldn't figure out how to...
How did I break down these...
What they think to be...
It is technology, but they haven't found a way to access it.
They can use their energy, but they can't actually control these machines that come from them.
Right.
It's like giving a fucking motorcycle to some monkeys.
They might figure out how to turn the key, but they don't know how to help work.
Yep.
That's pretty good knowledge, actually.
So pretty much what's happened is the colony ship was sent to the planet.
Both sent something ahead of them to build for them to be ready when they got there.
So imagine you're traveling two and a thousand years now.
They underestimated the ability of the machines.
So by the time that the humans got here, the machines had laid this grand thing and it shut off.
As well as the humans though.
So now they've arrived on this planet with these massive, unknown structures.
But we don't know who made them.
How the fuck they're there or what they do.
But in reality, they're...
They've been living by them for a little amount of time gathering these dotics,
which are like these 12 side of things.
And we deal with these wonderful things, but at the end of the day,
they realize we don't know what the fuck they do, but we're using them anyway.
And by using them, they run off to this AI that has now went from this donut
to an active amongst the body, the inner ax of them, and has grown up beside them.
And now together they're trying to figure out what is the purpose of this town.
But for these, it is only the most centuries fascinating through fantastic concept.
And the twist is...
Optimistic utopian people find out, oh, we made this.
Yeah, but it's humanity that we lost contact with all of those years ago.
Yeah, so right now, what ancient civilization is?
Technically.
Okay, this is interesting.
So the civilization before them is catching a younger.
They're after this generation.
They're the older ones, human understanding.
But that's not how it works at all.
It's actually reverse.
Older ones thrive longer than that.
Fader.
So the species that mounted on old, because they grew up in the unique environment,
works the after-technology from...
They can live like...
They don't have a normal lifespan.
They hold for like thousands of years.
So by the time they've reached here, they're from the fourth group,
but in the second group, right?
Yeah, I mean, you'd say there's like...
There's less of them.
They're not immune from decay.
But...
But the generations that have made it to the planet don't realize that the sharks that they found,
they think that they found evidence of another life.
Right.
Like, what they're thinking is this is an alien race.
And right now, they're thinking either they got wiped out by wolves,
or they abandoned this for some reason.
But then...
Well, he's working as a scientist character.
But I mean, you want to flesh out a character,
and you want to give this guy a background of personality,
a purpose in the world.
So imagine that they're in this world, because it's utopian,
because there are no choms.
There's no automation everywhere.
Machines are not taking over the world.
We built machines, and they did as well.
They served to help humanity.
And they're not like slaves, because they aren't sentient.
They're just machines. They're just.
But then you have the donax that are sentient.
We have decided against using these.
We understand that they're beings.
We understand that they communicate.
We don't want to slave them.
We let them free.
Let them be free, because they haven't caused violence to have them.
Don't anything...
That's your secondary race.
Yeah, the secondary race.
The player race.
Also the...
The main character.
Do we interact the world?
That's going to be the...
Another trip you asked.
Yeah, so...
The way that the nodex slope is,
you'll give it a body,
and typically it's with a family you've made an arrangement with.
And you start on that basic body,
and as you interact, you go in and unlock pieces.
So what if...
What if...
Just a little more awestruck.
You see these...
Mysterious machines that are wondering about.
You see these...
These...
The tendrilike structures.
These are the other players,
but you don't have that body yet.
You're just a dodeck.
You don't realize that that's you.
You are one of those machines.
So I imagine like you have...
Oh, a fashion-like machine.
You're walking around.
This is what he believes,
but they might know that they have a dodeck inside them.
They haven't grown out yet.
But at the same time,
there's like a...
They don't know how to become that thing,
and they don't fully grasp that they are that thing.
They may not believe it entirely.
Maybe it's not expressed to them anyway.
They really become that...
Imagine...
Yeah, they're interaction.
Imagine that a human attached parts, David.
Imagine this dodeck and it can spiral out tendrils.
It can reach, reach, it can grasp.
It can almost become a dog or cat relative to us.
It just doesn't understand how to...
It's not there yet.
It doesn't have enough...
It hasn't broke down. It's consciousness.
It hasn't become more...
It's like that.
There's something consciousness through it.
The thing is, the dodeck,
when it stokes out,
it stokes as a small thing,
probably sounds like this.
It doesn't realize that...
It doesn't realize that these things are bodies.
So, what he's trying to say is,
the beginning is he stowed off of this little body.
And the dodecks have no knowledge of his shoes.
So, they have to run everything from the other dodecks.
So, these things are open and sitting.
The camera criticism is for that ball.
And you get to see all these big machines,
like people like walking around.
These machines and the walls.
Imagine if you're replaying it, then you realize,
on your fullscreen thing, you're going to see.
You're like, whoa.
There are always people.
And then it's going to score this one.
And then, as you play through the game,
those are you.
That's your race.
And so,
he's holding it out.
Well, you stowed off thinking of one of the human derivatives.
Well, not necessarily.
I mean, you're in the background.
Now, aren't you?
I was going to assume that they're the organic one,
not the machines,
because that's never going to be done.
And then he gave you,
you're not going to show yourself in a demeanor.
And you're just going to be.
No, you could.
Not a first.
I mean, yeah.
That's good.
You can hit it for a while.
First twist.
Okay.
I couldn't look in the mirror.
Wow.
What is that?
Oh, between you, like a robot.
Oh, shit.
It's like an HP Lovecraft.
Yeah.
Getting the castle out, God.
But it would run away.
And he's like,
oh, shit.
There's a monster.
Goes up and he's like,
oh, it's me.
Oh, my God.
That'd be a good trailer.
Imagine, like, you're talking to the right,
and then you're like,
oh, whoa, whoa.
Whoa.
It's a Lovecraft.
It's Tendrils.
Dude, that grilled blind stuff.
How about how you live in the mirror?
And you walk to a party.
And you're like, this guy,
and he's like, wow.
And if you can see him,
they go, oh, my God,
there's a monster.
And he starts freaking out.
Look, shit, there's a monster.
Everyone starts running away.
And he starts running.
And he comes up to what he thinks is a doorway.
And he freezes.
And he realizes that it's a mirror,
because he touches it.
And he's like, oh, fuck.
I'm just hitting his monster, shit.
He went around thinking he thought it wasn't normal for us.
And then,
how long he thought he was normal,
went to this party,
and went flipped on him.
How long is until a player sees his other mirror?
Until he sees his body for the first time.
You can,
imagine.
Imagine, imagine,
they take it to the end.
I don't know.
Imagine they see it.
You guys want to get the player
at the about your explore.
This world, right?
Have you seen it before?
So...
Fraction?
It's a shit movie,
but it has an amazing twist.
So tell me,
it's Thomas West.
You spend this whole movie thinking this guy's wife
and daughter were kidnapped by a hospital.
The way that they set it up is
you see things for organ chance fight.
And this dude's had an accident where he's fallen
and his daughter was born.
And his hospital was giving him a run around.
But he finally gets him checked in.
And they're finally all going through.
And he...
Appears to pass out on a bench.
He waits back up
and the hospital's telling him
we don't have your family registered here.
The shift is left
and the next shift is there.
No way, dude.
You don't have a family here.
Get the fuck out.
So he leaves.
Comes back.
Gets arrested.
He rinses the cops.
He kidnapped his family.
They go to where this accident happened
and the twist is he killed them.
Flipped.
Through the bodies in the trunk.
Joke himself to the hospital.
Thought he checked them into the hospital.
Killed all these doctors.
And at the end of the movie,
he think he's found his wife
and daughter runs him out of the hospital.
They're gathering the truck and it pans over
and he's by himself in the court.
It is some random dude
and scrubs thing on his seat.
And he's just us today
and he keeps going back
and he sees wife and daughter dead in the court.
But the whole movie they made me look like
his family got kidnapped.
So if you control the narrative,
the player will make the assumption.
So all you have to do
is avoid describing the character
which is really easy
in what you're going to be doing.
Just have them talk about something else.
Yeah.
Because you said they're not a parents-based.
So it could be really easy
to ignore that effect.
You don't have to hide from them for a long time.
So imagine.
Okay.


# REC027.txt
So, imagine that they do know they are aware, but they're not aware first, they get a little
time to, okay now they always see me face around the thing, okay, so then NPCs sort of acknowledge
them as a thing, right, because they interact more, they use their hands almost, like they're
more expressive, they have a voice now, they have, you know, at first they were just observing,
you know, being recognized, they see it as like a little, a little, one of the creatures,
right, but that's not fully developed, so they recognize it as like a baby or a cat or
a dog, yeah, but then eventually it starts talking, it starts communicating, you know,
and then that expression, that language is already understood, because these things are
so prevalent, all right, it's a language that is, you know, maybe not everyone understands
it, you know, people will actually dedicate the time to understand a language, and that's
why you can't talk to everyone, that's interesting, you can listen a lot of time, you can interaction
people at know your language, yeah, but some people know basic language, some people know
it more advanced language, right, so I say, but if they don't know your language, they
just be like, oh, I mean I can voice it, yeah, nothing to say there, so you talk to them
like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, well a little bit, but it's a little more like, it's
not a little intelligence, it's just the overall inability to communicate between people that
are different in different interests, no, I haven't, but I've seen some of the reactions
of the low intelligence, you still have all your regular skills, but when it comes to like, talking, your dialect
choices on room, or just random pieces of dialogue, I think it's a little, I don't, I don't
know, that's my good sound, I don't think anyone is that dumb, all right, none of that, no, there's
more of a joke that you can do that's just true, I mean they have other, other, other intelligences
that are good at mechanic work, we were just, we were just told, we were trying to get rid of a shock
at memory casinos, it's like all the downy pieces of my guy would just be like, yeah okay, we're
just gonna shoot you now, I don't think you could do little voices, oh shit I forgot about that,
you could do little voices, you could do a little okay, so imagine a fashion like character,
Archery Day character, right?
Oh, I see it going full.
You know, it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
He wants a language of just no actual form of words.
Oh, I mean, you could do that with a piano.
A piano might be beautiful, actually.
You need a piano.
A synthesizer.
Leo, that's... that's...
What about a violin?
Maybe you have an instrument, right?
Well, you...
What do I explain?
It's like a knob, a couple knobs in a switch.
You know, you hit a tone at that hold.
And you just work it with your switch or your knob.
Oh, I don't know.
I hit you.
You've got to show me that.
I don't...
So...
Oh, man.
Oh, what are they called?
SciShow.
SciShow.
Damn it.
Keep going.
So here's what I'm wondering.
He said you're going to have colors, right?
And sound.
Mm-hmm.
What did you want to use for the bass or the sound that he wants?
Natural noises, synthetic noises.
I think I'd like...
Naturalistic noises, but also...
It's so close to the ball calls.
It's exactly close.
Yeah, but there's all...
Bird calls, yeah, yeah.
Um...
You know, more musical, in a sense.
But also, hang on, there's also this other thing.
They're musical.
But they're also this thing I'm trying to find a cheese.
Well, it's a thing like this.
The bass is an dynamic.
So real bass, like...
You know, it's like...
They make a beep.
Is it obviously mechanically bass noise?
Do you want that?
Or do you want something that I would be closer to?
And it sounds like we're here in nature, right?
So close and stuff.
You know how we, um...
There's a spectrum of radio wavelengths, right?
There's actually a spectrum of that wavelength emitted from the aura.
And there are these aura whistlers.
I found it.
aura whistler.
Yeah.
So here's another thing you might want to think about for your species.
Giving them more than five senses.
One of five senses?
So...
In...
Some of the sci-fi bread.
When they make the aliens, they make them to well...
The reason why they can't communicate with humans is because...
They don't use normal language.
They use like...
A mix of dots and...
Dude.
Sounds.
Like...
I don't...
These three love crafts.
Old ones, for example.
They don't have a vocal system.
These things have a series of tubes instead.
These things are above 60 hertz.
You can't hear them.
Okay.
You can't hear them this phone.
Yeah.
Speakers of shit.
Do you have a speaker that's...
Oh, TV.
What are you doing to do?
These aura whistlers can't be heard via the shitty ass speakers of my phone.
Type in aura whistler.
Oh, it's almost a noise that the northern lights make.
Yes.
Exactly.
The spectrum, the spectrum that we can interpret as some...
It's not...
Yeah.
What is it?
You can test the rest of the X or some shit like that.
Oh, from the terminal.
I should search again.
So, what he's going for is...
His AI communicate through sound code.
This should be SRX.
Number number number.
See him?
How do you...
That damn phone.
Is that a password?
It's...
Ah boy, see...
Is it on your computer?
Yeah, it's on your computer.
It's on your computer.
Or it works on your computer?
No.
Open your laptop.
The computer?
No, what else?
I don't want to see you want to try this or you want to try this
I'll try more of that and I won't do it like that
So for the day I only wear
Are they wearable?
That's a puzzle
They are wearable?
They are
It's not an intentional puzzle
It's because they dismantle the structure
But it's all known as intentional
I don't mean like that
So we know that they don't know the history
Do they have any idea of how the door works?
Let's say they've gotten the hint that it works
Let's say the door
No, no, I think the thing is here
There's my question
Do they know it's a door they're trying to open
They see it as a door
They believe it as a door
It's not explicitly a door
Do they know all the doors are connected?
They don't know
Do they see the symbols?
Do they see the doors?
Do they see six?
They make the pattern that all these doors are open
You know, they're humans
They're intuitive, they're...
I don't know how they do on the connection
between pattern on the doors and pattern on the doughnuts
Somehow opening the doors
No
Okay, see that's what I'm gonna figure out
Because I'm about ready to go
Well, he's talking about his research
So I'm just gonna know how much do they know
So I don't fuck up the answers
Maybe they don't...
They can't find a way to get these door next to
So what I've been running with is we have the doughnut
But I'm gonna have it
Well, maybe the player has some kind of a puzzle
Maybe the missing piece for something
It was that you need to have a human collaborator
and a doughnut collaborator
Because the doughnuts were made of flour
Oh, that's hers
Okay
So we have the doughnuts were made from the thing
Right?
But my question was
They do
Let me show you my computer
Let me show you my computer
You have sound, come on
It's no sound
They do
They do have sound
He's fucking it less
No, I'm not fucking you guys
They do have sound
You gotta come over
You gotta show you my fucking headphones
and my DAG amp
Amp fire and a digital audio converter
So it's more precise than these things
My phone especially
Yeah, we're probably gonna need some more later
There you go
So
I'm gonna take that one
and set it up
I'm not even bringing that one
It seems like it
It's nice to see it all
It's nice to see it all

Imagine you have bonfires like dark souls right in a social space. There's no combat
Socializing and then you have like a section of dialogue, right a large-large story that you articulate, right?
These are all these characters interacting and stuff. I guess that social space is that time period. Keep the scope small
Yeah, so you go through it once you go through it again
You can use bonfire reset social situation till you have it like they like it and you get a new dough deck
It's like the AI simulating it over over again. They're going through a right
So and then breaking through once and then moving to the next section
So it's kind of like with that little room to be set up all the patios we made. Yeah, but a little more open
Like it's a lot of social space. There's there's main characters
Yeah, and then there's the characters that are secondary and the characters the secondary characters don't affect the storyline too much
And then the even the tertiary characters are all really just background stuff
But then ones you can really talk to that interact with a lot
They're on the film or he's not in the same characters. I'm not insane, but this is this is what is going up the dough deck. We have to get
We'll get this
They're truly using the sides of big room. Is that what it's going to look like at first?
Dinner sides probably it's because it we have to exaggerate it because it's a lot more complex. It's a 12-sided dice, but
Viewers
What is 12 times 12?
Okay
well
You know
That's what I'm just going to say.
MF does that.
Hey, go home.
Hey, go home.
What is 12 times eight?
The answer is 96.
I think I'm sorry.
I feel it misunderstood me so bad.
Is it only does it only respond to your voice?
Google your page.
Sorry.
I don't understand.
How do I save this?
Is this safe?
144.
Is it safe now Leo?
No, no, no.
What are the better?
You can only save it a better.
Let me see.
Can you escape?
It says search 10.
I think it saved.
No one gave him?
No, it didn't.
Okay, so it escaped.
You gotta grab the gift right there.
Yeah.
I'm in the village.
Hey, Google.
Hail Hydra.
Oh, God.
Yeah, buddy.
Hey, Google.
Hello.
No, no.
Oh, God.
Where are you?
No.
Oh, I always wanted one of those, dude.
That's not what I said.
Sure.
Hey, Chris.
How can I help?
I want to turn it off and off.
No, you killed her.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know who's a fascist.
I'm not damn it, Leo.
You're a Tifa fuck.
That's fucking bizarre.
What did I say?
He said he's...
He's like Hail Hitler, right?
He said Hail Hitler.
You said...
Hail Hydra.
Hail Hydra.
I don't know.
He's at least PC.
She tried to connect with him.
I always said Hail America.
Because that's not great either.
It is.
If only FBI'd be good for your case.
Hell Donald Trump.
All right.
All right, whatever, man.
Oh, God.
Okay.
What the fuck?
These are the people here.


# REC030.txt
Oh Leo how was my reason oh my god
Ah, this is not the end. I shoot with so many people with that phrase over
It makes me so I can stop it
Dude, no, no this kills me for a night when you say a cherry on a big D-screen
White lives only oh my god
Oh my god, he's screaming out of the chair and allowed at the end of the lobby
Everyone's like what the fuck hey, there's people
I'm protected by Jesus
Jesus to show
Take you guys back to this place
I don't know
All you need is Jesus and Trump, the Holy duo
Guys, oh my god
Oh, is it as a passthrough saying in the cowboys?
The door's a door
That was a man
Well, if it's still there, he knows I'm foolish at half the time
I think it's so clear at going like anyone here is
I'm trying to survive but I'm pretty loud in my room
I'm safe
Oh
Boom, boom
Dude, we got Opa Gadi today
I know, you want to make a pussy, you blooms so bad
Without luck, a dog
No, not a cow
Because he wanted to capture my life of course
So he went into a tunnel with a bunch of his kids
And when the US threw in the storm, he's like okay, hit the button, the blooms so bad
We don't like a dog
So Russia might have us by the bulls, they caught us, the leafly smuggling oil with food
Some Terry's group
But thankfully it's just a little rest, I don't even know this
So right now we can fight him, but if they have hyenas, we'll fight
I'm impressed he hasn't bitten me yet
He doesn't fight believe it or not
He's grown up finally
He used to be a vicious little feister
Dude, he's still an asshole
I got a tank for sitting on the couch
Alright, we're gonna play
So we're here to work your place?
No, we don't
I really want to show you to see you here though
Can you assault while you're projector?
Can you split screen on my?
You can't, can we try that one?
We're going to fight against him
Can we try that one?
We can't do...
Yeah, I can see from your spot
Did I show you that?
No, I don't know, I know that
Careful
You can not face the screen now with the players here
No, no, I mean, that's what it means trying to join you
Can we do two people together?
We did both online
We did both
And I'm group
No
You can't make the people survive in online
Let's try it early
We're trying to connect you to me
No, we're not going to connect
We're trying to connect us to you
No, no, we're not going to do that
We're just going to use your side
Have two people go online
Does he ever get up here?
Yes
But I'm going to give this round
Let's get it
I don't have to rush around
Because I want to see if you can do two players from this
We can, you can do two players here
No, I mean, do two players online?
Okay
So it's the third one
I think
Okay
Let's see
I mean, I'll be sure to set up right
Because I was fighting, I thought I was fighting split screens on my own
Okay
So that only means just which is
There's my remote level off
It's one of these ports
Is it QLED or no LED?
It's OK
It's OK
It's OK
This is on the turn-off
It's OK
Oh, I'm ready to forget
Oh, I'm used to it, it's got a PC, I'm going to need it
I was like, you know, it's like a controller, here we go
It's OK
How do I do it?
I'm not supposed to control it
Video?
Are you comfortable with the PlayStation control?
Oh, yeah
What do you want to split screen?
What we're going to see if we can do the split screen online and shoot players
Or, no, it's just split screen campaign
Yep
Because everyone can do it
I don't know, I have more fun shooting than the players
Anyway, I like to screen them
Because they're easy to get around
I was doing horses, I would drop two, and then his weight
If I didn't spot it, we would go to revive
It's OK
Oh, that's right
I'm going to shoot later
I'm going forward
I'm going straight
I'm going straight
I'm going straight
I'm going straight
It's OK
They're saving us up, they suck again.
Now they're alone.
You see my fours open though?
Is that something happened?
I sure am.
One, two, three.
That's...
Charlie, Charlie.
There you go.
Is there a display there?
The 20 you're trying to connect to?
Two or one.
I'm trying to connect to.
It seems like three is an on-the-zone.
I'm not sure which one.
I can't change the end for here.
Because I'm on my remote.
I lost my remote.
I can't find it.
So I've got to find a physical button.
Probably on the inside.
I don't think this is going to be useful actually.
No, I mean, you have...
No, I think there's more things on here that pop up with controller back here.
Can you try to change the input?
Yeah.
Settings, picture sound, channels.
Channels.
And the manager.
The first one.
Okay.
Which one?
The fourth one and the other one.
A little more of that.
Fucking circle, let me get it.
Right there.
Right there.
But then you have...
I'd like to be an HDMI console.
A console.
A console.
Desktop.
I think it's through console.
Is it working?
You need to plug in the computer.
No, you're right.
Hang on, I think you're right here.
I think it's the console.
I think I have block number one.
Ah-ha.
Shit.
Holy shit.
You guys didn't smoke, dude.
No offense.
Damn, that TV looks good.
Look at that shit.
That fucking sharp is a damn knife.
Fuck, I'm loving it.
That's the...
No, I know, I want it.
That's hard to tell, right?
It's just...
It's just...
It's just...
It's just...
It's just...
It's just...
Yeah.
I want one.
Oh my god, dude.
It's just like $1300 a month.
It's been about three grand on it.
I bought it.
Three grand T80.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But, um, I think that...
The price has gone down down.
There's TVs like...
Wait, a thousand.
Yeah.
The...
I'm not even happy with $1300.
Yeah.
Because it's better for one.
Excuse me.
The newer models are worth it, too.
I don't think I'm putting it up.
This is for a great time, please.
It's like buying...
You know those big box TVs, haven't you?
I'm not.
I'm not.
I'm not.
Well, yeah, you can buy as soon as you buy it.
It's out of date.
It's out of date.
Yeah.
It's true.
It's on the market.
Anyway.
It's pretty heavy.
It's worth it.
Uh, and then...
Right.
And then...
Best out of the thing, guys.
Got set up, right?
And that turns on whenever...
It's port is activated.
I'm pretty sure a lot of everything is here, too.
And the question...
What does that mean?
Why?
It's like my...
I guess.
Potion.
What should we try it off?
You've got to dump love in the place.
Otherwise, the controller's in a state synchronized to it.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Ugh.
Tao-chan.
Hero-cheateral.
엎고�.
You got a reward.
A Darkaar.
The Dark 2D.
I have this thing where you can launch things right on the picture, it'll show you the display.
So I have this monitor, but then I go to the big picture mode, which is to not the slide, like this one here.
But they're all named generic PNP monitor.
So it's super mic.
I'm sure this will change the names.
It's just a hassle.
Yeah.
Hopefully it's that one.
If it's not, it's not that one.
Oh, there's a solution.
Okay, come on there.
Runs of UT, that's already.
Yeah, I give them gold toys.
You know, whenever I thought, you love this stuff, man.
It seems like makeshift toys.
You know, like old strings or bits of card board.
What do we want to start with?
What do we swap?
What do you feel?
I feel I am.
Yes.
But no, I think I'm switching back to the green stuff.
Green free stuff.
So he's got half of that in there and half of that.
He's doing pretty good though.
He's got a lot of vitamins for his fur.
That's true.
It's just okay.
It's okay.
It is okay.
The other thing you gotta worry about with green free is they get fatter.
They eat too much.
Then you might get some type of one for a minute.
But can you pick one out?
Is he a little old man?
Oh, perfect.
Yes?
Okay.
He's a healthy boy.
These two are a little thin.
You think the table isn't going to slow down for a time?
Yeah, probably.
And then it might get too.
And you know, you got to play it by ear.
Like my last time he's had too fast and he lost with down to like 18 to 9 pounds.
He's a load even faster.
You know, what have I had?
Did you think he'd try to feed a frisky thing?
Interesting.
So what if I had like a bowl of the green free stuff?
Not like a small bowl.
I had like a larger bowl at the normal side.
That's fine.
Yeah.
You don't care to deal with your beer.
You'd have an easy, real easy time.
It doesn't go over either.
You eat as much as you need, so you eat as much as you want.
And it takes like a fucking 30% of the bowl.
Which I like.
I like too.
What you could do is just feed them.
Oh, shit.
Is it a two or a half?
It's because of the day you mix it up.
So dry and wet food.
That's not it.
The thing goes over with that time.
It's like the drying wet food.
And that's after teeth.
And that's how they ideally, I can't brush them.
I don't know how.
I can't think they'll learn.
Ideally, the healthiest is just doing them wet food.
I'm having sex, too.
It's not like you're in the shelter.
Are you using a god?
Sure.
I can.
Catch this.
Or nice thing.
Cheers.
That's it.
That's it.
OK.
That's it.
Oh, no.
Yeah.
That's it.
Yeah.
I'm having sex, too.
That's fine.
Yes.
I'm having sex, too.
It's not.
Hold your hand.
Are you using god?
I'm taking it.
It touches me.
So...
Maken!
I...
want the stuff to be rich,
as complicated as that.
Okay, don't get any...
Sorry, sorry.
Let me just..?
Sure, sure..
Yeah..
Ok, here.
Perfect
Oh my Lord
picture
Let's take a little nice.
Oh wait, it's over it's over here, I'm going to change it in place in the middle.


# REC031.txt
I'll show you this game, it's from monitor display 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
2D!
So, what's this?
Yeah, I'll kill all of you.
Fuck you guys.
No, this is so fucking good. Look at this TV.
We're just trying to see if we can have...
Oh, this fucking TV, Leo.
We can watch your own.
We can watch your own.
We can't do these.
Let me find my...
You know, can I get a yellow?
A purple bird before?
If it's a yellow bird, anyway, let's check this.
Let's check this.
Fuck you guys.
No, I know.
We'll spend this on this TV lens.
Like, shit.
Well, it's only gonna be two people.
This fucking TV gives me a boner, dude.
Let's try.
And truckers here.
It's not gonna work if they...
Trust me, let me see it too.
What's the refresh rate on this one?
It's in the chancellor press.
It's 120.
You think everyone?
No, it's 60, actually.
It's just 60.
Yeah, I think that's...
That's the sacrifice.
That's the sacrifice, man.
I'm gonna go higher, higher, higher.
I know.
I know.
Yeah, that's where those mainly fits in these up here.
It's four pay HDR and it's all that.
So it's like...
Yeah, I don't see where they invite your...
What, buddy?
Not mine.
I'm not sure if I have it on my phone.
I would need my own account, though.
I just want to give you a movie, guys.
We're trying to do...
What was your new campaign with?
For people who can't do...
Yeah, a campaign.
That's fucking local, though.
I know, I know.
You should try not to worry about it.
It's so cool.
But, um...
You can control it.
I don't need anything.
Should we relaunch it?
Come on, press it in.
I'm trying to do it, so we're...
Do we keep the deal more?
How do they do that now?
We used to do it too.
To say when, maybe, you know...
You know, they might be able to do it in a little bit of a second.
What it used to be...
If I download a nice...
No, but...
It won't be online, but I bet.
You might be able to do two players, uh-huh.
What if you turn a campaign and you can't do three months later?
No.
Still, you should be able to do three months later.
Four months later.
You make the game a little more social.
I don't think you can do that unless everyone has their own account.
We're gonna bring this to you, too.
Let me...
Yeah, if you had your viewers...
I'm gonna show you more how, man.
That's a lot of fun, too.
This is running through the Xbox.
No, this is...
This is my PC.
I know, but it connects into the Xbox.
So you can't play an Xbox and PC here, right?
If I'm using control...
If I'm using control...
I have it on Xbox.
I have a PC controller, I think.
That's not bad, dude.
Did the Xbox have to play on it?
I don't know, because I don't want to play a new video, you know what I mean?
Right.
Versus...
Replay.
What I'm saying to play is the other player.
What pumpkin ball has to play, is probably.
For sure.
I'm trying to block it, man.
Search for player by knee or tag to find somebody.
That's me.
Are we able to stick with control over this door?
No, it all controls me, man.
It's so fucking fun.
So maybe you should walk with it if you're able to.
There should be some kind of indicator over here,
and then when you click in,
you should let your register in another profile.
Oh, what the hell?
Well, hang on, let's try...
Could you add an account, and then...
Is this adding friends, right?
You know, we're taping my game with tags.
What's your game with tags?
Roath is 66.
It looks something like that.
Got online, not provided.
Yeah.
It's just 767.
I don't like my Xbox tag.
Because I'm offline right now, maybe.
Anyway, let's try...
Strip us somewhere.
You see there's a new club there?
Line game.
Post?
Oh, there's nothing.
Should I have everybody?
Sure.
Yes, I'm just competing.
Yeah.
Well, the alternative was we could just drive up to Virginia City
and start a fire.
I'm down.
Oh, and these are the ninth ones.
I brought those so Chris, you got to drive.
Oh, and these are the ninth ones.
We're in Virginia City.
What do you mean?
It's gonna go burn some grey guards, which is...
Oh, I just need a nine-watt paper clip.
Oh, I just need a nine-watt paper clip.
This is a campfire.
Yeah.
Of a soul.
Yeah, this is campfire enough.
But we could start a fire.
We should have fired.
We should have fired, please.
You want a second one?
People in the cemetery.
Who tried?
Let me show you outside.
People in the cemetery will call it.
They have to warm them up.
Start working.
We have to warm up to people in the cemetery.
Oh, seriously?
A nine-watt paper clip?
A station paper.
So people can just...
Shit.


# REC032.txt
I have a reference for it, visually, and it's actually a suit with veins in it.
And these veins are designed to regulate temperature over the body.
It's like a, it's a beautiful little engineering device, it's like water being, it's like a,
this is a warm liquid because it causes the cold air to flow around and so on.
Well, not to say a warm liquid actually just uses a human body, body regulation, human
temperature to regulate itself and use the water to move it around to average out and
you have like a means to exhaust the radiation by sway, way, way of steam.
And it's just such as the same region of the human body is where you get a cut and all
the exhaust fluid.
No, no, it's like a, it's like a,
Granted, the skin would be tough if it were.
Yeah, it could be like a tough clothing, but also, it also has to be like clothing.
Yeah, flexible, it can be too rigid, it has to be casual, it also has to be, it has to
be comfortable and active and cooling or regulating, I should say, although every tight
clothing is really ready to go with that because you keep it tight to your skin, you know,
it's more.
So, you just regulate with that kind of thing.
I think the first thing that those kind of outfits is wrist, neck, and ankles placed.
Why not do an entire thing?
I mean, no, I mean, no, like those points,
I imagine like, I wish you with like a T-shirt, you know, but it's more regular, regular
toy.
It's like a body armor.
If they have it, it's going to be out for a quarter of a year.
Is it going to leak, wrist?
Because the movement, your neck, things, your clothes, they're going to be torn around because
depending on how they're going to be.
Well, they don't have to be, like a bulletproof vest, like, shape.
Well, the suit can compensate for that.
Imagine it, okay, so you lose, you lose energy that way, right?
It's not a totally efficient system.
Imagine the suit could regulate, could, you're going to lose energy, no matter what
system.
Yeah, I know exactly.
You got to put more, more engine into it.
But imagine if wireless charging by then and that's energy's on issue, you know, we're
charging these all the time, you know, there.
And we're not paired with electricity.
There's a lot of pressure.
There's going to be a weak spot because as it's going to be used as a vaning spot,
corner is going to force us way in, as the hunter is leaving.
Oh.
Okay.
Okay.
So I guess it has to be tight then.
It has to be tight clothing.
It can't be loose at all.
Otherwise, no, I mean, imagine if you had that tight, that tight layer beneath, imagine
if you had like a new tank top, right, you have, you have underneath clothing, imagine
you have, you have, this suit is like the underneath clothing, right?
And then you have these stylistic clothing above of that, you know, that way it's more
of a, I mean, a means of comfort and also a trend, and you can have different colors
and stuff.
And it's like, yeah, that's, I mean, interesting.
Um, jeez, what else?
Do you see about that space gun?
Space gun.
So, when the back time New Jersey sent a mask about up, he made a gun that she's in space
or they were just, we're fine, the model looked better.
It still looks like a tanky piece of shit, but if I was a pegged only, put it up, it's
a vacuuming gun.
It shoots a regular bullet.
The whole reaction takes place inside of it and then she's project that well.
So, like a, um, the connect missiles, but also a little more space like?
Well, this is, it's a regular gun.
But it uses a function.
Yeah, but still not.
Not just.
It uses the regular traditional reaction.
You're igniting, you're igniting, you're using oxygen.
Yeah, I'll say it had an oxygen, it's also on it.
And here's, how do I tell you, I have, that's just going to, be using the ion engines,
one of the future missions, pretty soon.
I'm finding these things, they don't blow up.
Well, I don't think they blow up, but I think it's like, you're all you're doing is you're
taking energy, right?
And you're using an ion's propulsion, you're using, you're converting the energy into thrust.
It's really cool.
Yeah, but, yeah, so those engines are really sensitive.
They're not fast, they're sensitive, they're precise.
They're like, good for satellites.
It's good for long travel.

We can't, it's difficult for us to build backwards, right?
But we all, we won't get closer and closer
as time goes on regardless.
But I think in order to activate the process,
we need to build spaces without cars, close-knit communities,
almost like tribes, or if the largest area in the space,
you can turn the far side of it,
you can see the personal on the adjacent side,
you can see the entire face.
Like this is, you're close enough to where there's
no misunderstanding, there's no miscommunication,
you have a tribe of people, a close-knit community.
50 years, 100 years.
Is it right out of space, we'll have to start doing this.
I don't know.
Remember the old population we talked about?
The old population is not going to be an issue.
We have a little population, it's just about...
There's a median, a gradient,
an average, first space to be found,
a comfortable space.
And I think that we will reach that average
through time and through proper architecture,
through proper city and design.
It's getting a bit better, that doesn't have anything to do here.
It doesn't talk about it.


# REC034.txt
So I'm very mad when you have maybe like about 20 countries will say that are excelling and you have all the other people that are still in countries that are getting to that point before they hit that balance.
I know people will go out that equation that they're doing isn't it coming from that extra info.
Because this whole thing is the country that has happened that population growth is going to stabilize.
What's happening is you have the new groups go from the other side of the spot.
So while the rest of the world has space when you have only a few countries that are relatively peaceful.
You made a world where people are going to flock to.
So it's not like we're running out of, there's too many people.
It's local areas are running out of space simply because we don't want to put it in the walk to fix these other countries.
So what's focusing on themselves and so because we're not putting in the walk to fix those other countries as much as we should instead of getting fixed or people want to go out.
So believe it or not.
Okay, so try to imagine this. Humans still live for a long time.
We only live for like 100 years at best.
70 is the average.
Anyway, so we only see a short span of time.
Imagine trying starting out.
Imagine the earth, right? It's floating above the earth, right?
And you see these representations of human communities.
And you have these small tribes, little dots.
It's spread out, spread out, spread out, spread out.
It's bigger, bigger, bigger.
And as they fall apart, they get further and further apart.
They get divided.
But then from inwards, from the areas they were developed the most.
They start developing closer and closer and closer and closer.
And then they spread out even further.
It's an ongoing process of people, communities getting closer together.
But we're so early on in this process that it's hard to imagine a utopian future.
We will get there.
It's just a matter of time.
Does it make sense for you?
Does it make sense for you?
I just, I don't like the idea of the utopia.
Oh God, that's...
I may as a goal, but yeah, you're gonna get there.
I don't think it works because that animal will be in the individual.
But if everyone, if the collective can make their individual individual bubble happiness,
we can meet those bubbles.
And then there's no more understanding.
You have bubbles of inter-prosal connection.
Huh?
So, three points or more.
12 million people believe aliens brought us the moon.
What do you think of those topics?
Those misunderstandings will go away with time.
Because as science understands, it improves.
Right now.
No, no, it's not.
Science communication is getting better overall in the population.
We're pessimistic.
We love the news, love the media.
The loud majority is the loud majority.
The loud majority are never represented with the majority.
That is the size of cities.
The silent majority are silent.
We are the silent majority, though.
I don't care about that.
When I'm talking about it.
It's what we do.
Everyone believes themselves to be good.
No one believes themselves to be evil.
Every human, the acting on their own.
I'm not even talking about morality.
I'm talking about what do you do with the people that don't want to aspire to this.
Because not everyone is going to get bomb.
It's a philosophy.
It's something that people don't want to do it.
It's a nevel philosophy.
It's a philosophy of understanding the connection.
I don't want to do it.
I don't know how it's 10 years.
No, no, no.
What do you do with that?
What do you do with that?
What do you do with that?
Why would you not want to build better communities?
Why would you not want to build better social spaces?
I don't know.
People like that, though.
What do you do with them?
It's the question.
You need to have a plan for what do you do with the people?
Because no matter how good it is, people are going to find the reason.
Okay.
I think you're going a little far in this.


# REC035.txt
No, you're right. You're absolutely right about that. But I think the point you're you're going around the wrong direction
I don't think people are going to be outward and hate. They're going to be inward and fusion.
No, it's not even outward hate. It's they just don't want to do it.
You're aspiring to a motion to this. It's not about a motion. It's about some people don't want to be told what to do.
And so they're going to react in a negative way even if it doesn't make sense. So it's what do you do with those people?
What do you do with the people who have just decided or I don't want to follow this?
Well, you isolated them too.
No, you don't isolate them. You keep them connected but at the same time you do rehabilitative retribution.
See, that just sounds like China now.
No, no, China.
Not retribution, rehabilitation, just in and of itself. Rehabilitation.
Rehabilitation.
Rehabilitation. God, no.
You've got to give them their own. Send them all to Texas, dude.
Just rehabilitate them. Let them and no one, no one, huh?
But how? It's been done in other countries.
So in small, I mean, not like large populations, but populations that are...
I don't really do that without looking like a moral...
That's the problem is even though I don't know how true...
You guys, you got to reach free will. You got to reach free will by the same here as that is...
I don't know who's playing this.
That's the thing. It's not everyone believes that. A large portion believes in free will.
It's like trying to teach a Christian to become an atheist.
So that's like going back to someone from the ages where we didn't have science holding up your phone
and convincing them you didn't trap something. You're going to get burned at the stake.
You know how to convince him. You can show him all the fun things he does.
But at the end of the day, there's going to be one person out of however many there is.
It looks at that. You can see something.
It's not something you can program out because all it is is like you said,
feel it's fly or fight. And all it is is the flight experience.
It's kicking in, but they can't run.
And they can't fight so they make these paranoid little circles.
And that's how these confused you grew up.
So, Tristan, imagine this. I've tried it extensively before.
But imagine you have, I think I have.
Imagine you have these three symbols, right?
And these three symbols are representative of a given individual's expression,
internally and externally.
And you combine these symbols to make emotions, inward or outward emotions,
that we express or not express, that we keep internally and express externally.
And these behaviors are deterministic.
They're perceivable. They're understandable.
We can break down the entirety of human interaction through a literal means
using a system of knowledge.
For example, aggression anxiety.
What are aggression anxiety through attributed to?
Aggression is anger.
Anxiety is fear.
That kind of thing.
You have, or at least, attributed to fear.
I don't think anxiety is the perfect expression of that.
There are variables in language that are not fully explained.
They're not fully expressed.
They're not fully articulated.
They're not affords.
They're gradients from missing because of how confusing this is.
So there's an under-linear video that doesn't talk about this specifically,
but in it, to be in these things, they're entering the building, the garbage,
but the cylinder of the language, you should watch it.
Because the guy that's leading it,
goes early into depth about the formation of language,
the formation of the house, and sending structure.
And he takes his sentence and he translates it into carbon
using these different variables that he built.
So it's like you're being a cultural anthropologist.
You're going cultural anthropologist and linguist.
Yeah, well, he's going to understand it.
And he's developing a language for the quality of the campaign.
And I'm not saying what's the whole series,
but that false video would help you out and understand the language.
Yeah, send me the link. That'd be good.
Okay.
Bye.


# REC036.txt
I don't know what English is, what is the D&D temper?
Yeah, I understand that.
It's free.
I can list it at work because that's all I need.
I didn't know.
I can do that.
I'll list it at work.
Did you see the new Santa Flash that go?
Let's ticklish.
Yeah, dude.
That's cool.
They're both synthetic flesh that they can use to graph onto a phone.
There's a joke right now.
But it responds to touch and it's ticklish.
And it's completely synthetic.
I made it in a lab putting that shit on it.
It's a synthetic wafer robot.
Yeah, I saw that it's a wafer kind of thing.
I love it.
It reacts to tickles.
That's what it is.
That's what it is.
That's what it's going to be.
So I'm going to buy that.
It's really cool.
Can you imagine when you get a new one?
Oh, my God.
You have the stimulation.
You can feel it.
Because that was the biggest issue for synthetic homes.
There's only the hand walks.
But even then, you don't get that situation.
But how do you connect that to nerves?
Well, if they've lost their home,
it's going to be a home mechanical unit.
Right.
But how do you connect the mechanical unit to individual nerves?
That's how we can show this.
We connect it to the nose.
Really, we can do that now.
I thought it was a muscle.
He has both his arms and both his legs.
And he just uses the whole system.
And he thinks that the hand does it for you.
I thought the thinking was the muscles.
It wasn't actually the movement of the arm.
It wasn't direct movement.
He doesn't move his arm actually.
He thinks they're moving his arm and the thought.
But it's not as direct.
It's not as quick.
No, it's still working out there.
But they've got it to the point now.
Yeah, instead of having him to actually physically move.
Maybe it's more of a...
Maybe he needs to go through more intensive physical therapy.
It's like his 70s response time.
This is an old dude.
So, in his 70s, he's a quadru...
He's also always lived.
And this is the fourth time he's been able to do anything.
He agreed to sign up for it because he had no limbs.
He couldn't touch a walk.
And now he can actually really mentally.
But he can turn doors.
He can pick up A and B.
So, as crazy as sounds, do you think someone would be...
Oh, no, people would think.
I don't know. I would do it.
Imagine if I can volunteer to...
I'm going to research this idea.


# REC037.txt
allow ourselves, willingly, living in now to donate a body. Like you can take my
arm if you give me a new one. I want to experiment. I want to know if I can
do the muscle movements. I want to learn. I will learn as hard as I can to make
that work. I want a tin, tin elbow arm with a
fucking tin. Have you seen that? Upgrade what's that? It's a cheesy movie about AI's
cybernetics, but what he does is he finds people that have had horrific
accidents and he gives them an AI that lets them move again, but he can show
them that he contract hits. It's the contract hits.
Chris Delia actually has a role in it. Chris Delia has a shotgun. His poem is
the bell and he loads it through his own right here. He just goes
and is on for you. If I got that, that's what I do. I just didn't really
told us through a shotgun. That's very great. Even if I was to do myself just a
pipe and a nail, one sec. I'll be alright with the laser cutter in my finger.
Oh fuck it. I'm just saying that I could have like that you do a lot. You get
anywhere you want to. Yeah. Just imagine the conversation sort of. Oh interrogations.
It's like I could go to the boat if you want. You know, a little slow movie
lightsaber. It's like it's like more towel. So if you see more towel, see this for
there for it. Oh I've seen people play. Oh we gotta show you that at some point.
So they changed some of the gun. They didn't agree that it's patched.


# REC038.txt
key your balance patch what they do
I don't know I haven't played it too much of the other news in the
Battle Axe so the heavy hand axe cannot repair stuff when you switch to the hammer
they finally added that in
That's pretty cool. So it's like you actually have
More control over it. Well, no, so the heavy hand axe
You know when you could flip it and it's on so the hammer
You can now repair stuff with it. Are you couldn't before? No, you couldn't use it to repair. What the fuck?
Yeah, I wanted to destroy you wait. Yeah, so now you say you something's built and it's damaging and you have that heavy hand axe
You can switch for the hammer to repair it
Oh, I never knew it was the mall because I was your lawyer
So I'm gonna explain this game to you real quick if I can
So more how it is this
Hacken slash brawler, right? It's like I like for honor
But it's it's late. It's less. You don't there's no. Yeah, chivalry, right?
It's uh, but I think it's closer in terms of for honor actually
I think it's for chivalry falls away from that the less competitive and more goofy. It's not as realistic
I think that this game is a does a better job of trying to
Yeah, they they've but they have this in the directional attacks right as you remember in chivalry
um
But then they have the movements is
It's less bizarre and such radical in chivalry like you can't you can't if you move like before really for our back
Uh, it'll fuck your attack
But if you if there are some people to do this bullshit where you like you look up
You attack you look down you attack and it's like that throws me off, but I think they they got a balance better
Anyway, um
The uh attack directions and you're you're chambering you're more free and you're throwing your storage into like
Like a lightsaber you go back and forth. You're you're kicking you're grabbing you're not grabbing you know
Yeah, he just you just uh
Hey
When they run into kick I'll just swing up and it just catches you in the bottom of the job. Yeah, because I think open is still in down so they block up
Crunch
That is satisfied the giving and the crunching. Yeah, um, I like it's the bastards were personally
So I like like I like you this you this thing called chambering you're in I'm not sure if that's sort of children I haven't played it, but um
Uh, you have you have the you're showing your sword right and then as the opponent
She's the incoming swing they can chamber they can attack into it like
Sure attack again, and like
You're dragging your sword across the screen and trying to fight for control on them. You know, it's like um
Swinging the sword in a in VR maybe that'd be fun. What are you doing?
When we're life
But then you have kicks and you can throw dirt and no, no, you can't throw dirt
You can throw smoke and you throw fire fire bombs and and axes and rocks and rocks and
Spears I love getting spirit like when you when you get stabbed your character the spear or arrow. They'll they'll get in pale your body
You have to look down
All right
You

That works too. We do it later as well. I appreciate it so
Okay, so I'm trying to mention
You're fighting it for honor
There's kind of bounce in two directions
You're throwing your attacker parrying
Dialog system
More rhythm game, not really rhythm game like there's dialect there, but it's meant to be satisfying over the game
Yeah, it's just really hard to explain
I was wondering if you could actually
Rearticulate it for me
Yeah, it's tough, huh
Anyway
Let's try it. It's all to describe a system. You don't have the actual physical
I mean like so do you have this system in concrete on how you want it to work?
Um, I'm building okay, so imagine
That's actually a good question. Let me okay, imagine now you have oh that's cool
I
Want to play
Nice nice. Are you ready to do it?
Here you eat
I can't fail you only shit
Okay
And maybe it was in this arcade
Do you have a cable? Yeah, I will go for a quick request play
Rule and left trail of ashes and blood across our okay, there's once you're gonna win new who left a trail over
Oh, goddamn. Oh, no, this changes in a week. Yeah, this is kind of read
Ready
Fucking miss the word
I'm playing so much for how I haven't played much from
I was gonna be close
No, it was a fun trouble
I thought it was very limited one assessed a couple
Oh
Oh
Damn it
And play
Oh
First
Oh
Oh
I thought
I
See
How do you think
Burning
I
Okay, so
So
So if you if you're tacked up when she attacks up you can use this
Post
Oh
One more try
What is
Hmm
So
So
God damn it
I won the cheesy way
Oh
Boy, oh boy, oh boy. Yeah
Yeah, let's just see that
How do I turn the fans down?
Huh?
No mind us to
I
Yeah, I think you will enjoy PC a little more especially if you get the right platform
I just think called gogg good old games and on the platform every game is here on free without any sort of attachment to the server
No
20 bucks and you buy a new platform of flash a good friend
DRM free man
So our game should be all times because it's archival. It's
It's not tied to a server
I think
Oh
And vicious so let's take a look at what go hand projects the future might have
So
So today we begin a new series looking at how we could apply to our own world some of the technologies we discussed for
You
Okay, I want to ask guys rather than I can um put these videos in my game
Don't get all kinds of views and they'll get he'll get ads or whatever
Or you know pay transport I should say because it hasn't been annoying so
Bye
Okay
Imagine
Ever seen the older ones
Okay, yeah, if you want to do it again
Let's see
This one
That's a brand new video from today
What if I know I just saw that I have a butterfly fact I didn't see this one
Is that it? Yeah
And I don't think I listened to my machine pan crisis yet
That's what you wanted to do
That's a new place
Anyway
Um, so I'm thinking here is what if
Okay, this guy is a piece of person, right? He's not some celebrity. He's this guy is making these videos, right?
Uh, he's
Got an audience he has a patreon and he responds to requests of the questions on patreon
Yeah, so I'm gonna ask him can I is it could I put these videos?
In my game like a YouTube video like a link like by watching and he can get ad revenue
But players imagine players in the game can explore they can see these videos they can watch videos
Because they're related to the world right in some way
What if it took way ads what if it was just to watch them to your leisure to your interest
And it links to a patreon
I mean like you have a video
As in like I get permission from him to
Include links visible links watchable links inside the world of the game
So you want a couple of that
Because it just breaks the narrative for you
You're right
Unless you put in the context of like this is archival data
We're watching it
Yeah, but even then you have to be very careful
Well, I'm selective about which which which ones you're available
Like the ones that are relevant to the world
So within that kill science fiction is your heart
And then I kill science fiction is your heart
Right
Yeah
But it's all to fantasize when something's being explained
How are you right?
So if you go and you explain the science behind some of this
It takes away some of the mystery
And you have a couple because you want to have some mystery for that game
But okay, so I he asked you wrote another artist using good enough make are doing science fiction
Yeah, not in the game
But or I can talk to him about like maybe you can bring me the game itself
Let me infuse you
Yeah, sure, that works too
I don't know how much he would like that
I don't know how much he requests that
Just ask it
Well, it doesn't like he's good intention
And I feel like if he has things that he wants the world to see like good science fiction
He wants to run it
So what if I could run the game?
That's the thing is everything subjective is there
Yeah, but I've seen it here before
So there's one at the same time that he won't do it
I'm just saying what you think is a good concept he might be less likely
So I've been able to make the concept widely appealing
And if the concept was right
If I could produce a demo
Make a demonstration of the game
A little bit of a slice I think he might be willing
But you're right, it's going to take some consideration
There's still a lot of green in there
There's still a lot of green in there
And there's still a lot of green in there
And there's still a lot of green in there
And there's still a lot of green in there
And there's still a lot of green in there
And there's still a lot of green in there
And there's still a lot of green in there
And there's still a lot of green in there
And there's still a lot of green in there
And there's still a lot of green in there
And there's still a lot of green in there
So you're going to do just about side
What I'm going to do is just about side
I'm going to do just about side
I'm going to do just about side
You're just going to do just about side
That's kind of nice doing it
It's kind of nice
That's the one
I'm so full, but at this time, that's good.
It saves you money, haven't we spent like 45 seconds on this, like, too much?
Just a week or a little?
I'll just have this one dry.

And this man said that he's was joining us to get to Stockholm.
So, then what do you have for大家 in endless congregation?
You left for Stockholm
and then you went with them as a decorate
and quickly moved them down.
to answer a couple of answers we get rolling. We do have an extra episode coming out this week on
Nebula. That's where we will see you after the ray of intelligence episode which is coming out.
It's like ray of technology. That's coming out this Thursday at the airport time.
We have a poll button right now for what episodes we're going to be doing.
It was a check-in.
Yeah, that would be good.
I do.
So we're going to start with questions.
I don't know how it would happen.
I don't know how it would happen.
I have a lot of problems so sure.
I'm going to follow my deck and we're going to get absolutely disappointed.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm not going to do that.
It's a check-in yet.
It was made to leave a hundred pounds.
I can bring my yeast on and just wrap myself in it.
If you move to telecast from the loop, you can do that with a push along, you know, new inertia into it.
So, for instance, if I was Liddy, my feet was on the moon, sometimes cannibalized, sometimes parkwise,
but it's all fun, you know.
These guys actually got less mass eye.
Just like the men.
Well, not just the communities actually don't work out.
You need to have a lot more information.
But I think I cannot.
You can always set up a list.
I could express myself like this.
You've been in the same place in the sky and seen or proculated, because that was really late.
I'm not just a professional collection.
How do you give a little bit of justice?
He's on Mads Books.
Yeah, that's crazy.
Okay.
So, you got a humble.
He's very technical.
Very mathematical.
How do you spend that book?
So, just a guy.
One of them has clear simulations.
He might have had to do that this way.
I'm not saying it's not.
He doesn't read those books.
I might have read a lot about it.
You're talking about it.
You're talking about it.
You're talking about it.
You're talking about it.
This might just be something you know.
fit.
He set up some of his kind of things that he can give.
But I'm sorry, for fairly Mario.
I'm actually the one that hasn't had the light on him yet.
Yeah.
Is there an owner who is showing some extra pieces.
No one knows that wasn't the guy.
I'm not fully sure they're wearing the Philanthropy.
Yeah.
True.
That disco here is just what you do in a scene.
That disco was about what you want.
People who have singing on that story,
You can get my socks, but for some reason, if you have a foot behind you, you can retype
about that.
But for yourself, more than that sauce, because they can look at that foot, and you can tear
up on such a thing.

I don't think humanity is definitely going to be doing this when I use
eggs and sperms that produce arousal make a long time.
You may have dredge in it, because we don't have a normal evolution anymore where you may have we have
controlled
Not controlled, like any two people can have a trial if they want to. It's just
They pull for larger pool as they're pulling from their own. They don't need to someone to the pool and they take two others
And I know she meant it's about just passing around. Yeah, it's just more genetic information around.
It's not information. That's great putting it. It's normalizing in a way that's
beneficial to a large population and small population. It's definitely diverse. Imagine like strictly speaking
the melaton levels in some of the skin. Imagine that's like it instead of being harsh
greedy harsh
Depends in that gradient you have a wide mesh a gradient a true gradient of all those potential variations. Yeah

social roles in the context of the story think of it like this if you go think
of an undercover cop for them to go and take him for trade a group maybe you
know what drives the group what's taboo they need to know the pliers there's
all kinds of little details that goes in the gunner cover because with some of
these groups even drinking your drink wrong gives you away this way not
trust no cultural okay here's a better example there's a story story I
had the lady had to practice how to spit a stone away because the planet has
constant winds to arms of door and that planet depending on how you spit they
can tell if you're a local or not because locals are experienced of spitting
into the wind well no but it's like it's tiny and visible things like that
just body language that we convey if I was realizing another example would
be a Yakuza so the developed they're broken down and see five basic
families when New York users meet it is traditional for them to take off
with all the clothes to show the tattoos because for them tattoos is how they
speak it conveys everything about them you start to symbolize victories the
feats gang that the earth and just your general achievement it's a way of
conveying all that info about having to speak to each other
I can pass this I got to get my keys out
oh it's too cold it is too cold I'm freezing
I'm going to get my keys out of here
which is a fireplace
do you feel like communities?
do you know when those in outside are ready?
yeah I mean I believe that's the thing that happens in humans
it does happen but I've never experienced the extreme
outwardness or distrust or that people convey to me exists
no it's not about distrust
no it's just when you go out there they just know you belong
they know you're someone not from any groups
it's not about trust it's just they know
it's not about trust it's about okay imagine a dollar grain
we talked about this so there's enmity and empathy
enmity and then there's aggression and anxiety
you have multiple of these variables affecting them okay what is that
person to you? for example let's say you're basically an human wise
behavior you're biological wise so imagine there's a
central mate
I mean as well like outside of horses group members
okay imagine there's okay that's different than this
but imagine there's a need for food
there is a social desire to work together because of the traits we've adapted
traits we've adapted to be close to be bond
there's there's there's there's there's there's there's
there's also social connection there's also social bonding
through the way we communicate there's
social bond it's just socialization it's it's
it's about building it's not bonding it's not about trust it's about it's about
it's about ownership
that's a beautiful way for us
so there are so many groups that if anyone how do you actually
really build these things
so like take take Siberia for example
the town to never be smaller than all towns built around one
purpose they tend to be very close
they don't turn away outsiders but one so
and that isn't a member of the community is there
they can know how you're having to talk to the
folks it makes out how the folks stand so they
jump over and
how they stand
depending on the group you're in there's these
subtle little actions that you can
unconsciously unconsciously
so could you think because you think of some examples in our culture
and I'd like to be a culture anthropologist
and you're going around in your
or linguist and you're
it's so different
because we can understand the cultures pretty easily
we're good about inducing others we're not good about inducing
ourselves
and I think
I think we have to make a point to
I mean we can do research to make sure there's
a thing about using a culture example
associates and management
when you have regular people
millions
they tend to like tell jokes that
maybe go a little bit against the line
but the second you drop in
someone from outside of the group
you'll notice there's a short
grainy and a force of knowledge
for some people
some people don't care
but some people they will portray them so it's completely different
because there's an outside of prison
people tend to build profiles
some of themselves that they carry
and other friends
and when they're in front of people that they don't know
almost like professionalism
we'll see this film today
conversation
a conversation that will walk on the phone
if you're telling over it will be hi how are you today
but that's the
in-impersonal conversation that is the
you're getting information
you're not actually being close to the person
yeah with the title of the symbol of the day
but if you hate it
and you hate it
you're not part of the group
there's just something that puts them all in the group
so this is where I think I need paper
so I need to take notes
I have plenty of home
I just need to have a wall to do on
I think that if
you imagine there are degrees of socialization
there's not like introvert extrovert
that's silly
there's no ambivalent bullshit
I mean there is
but there isn't
there's more ingredient
we categorize too much
we got to remember there's more
gradients in reality than we think
you know
what is this because someone is like
simplified
but being
mathematical, knowing that there's
gradient in
language
there's all sort of gradient in understanding
and a behavior in the expression
and everything you do
and words alone are not enough to convey that
don't have words tied to them really
they're not
I'm not going to put them in
the symbols as they appear to be
won't have
tables
the player is meant to infer
their meaning
it's like learning
kind of socialize


# REC044.txt
I think I'm pretty stoked, so I think I'm trying to keep myself tested into the actual
conversation or not drift off.
Oh, it's all good.
The grade debate.
You mean with launch crunch and...
No, it's a chance.
Oh, okay.
I had a Bill Nye and the other guy's Tyson and...
No, so this is an actual chick.
There it is.
It is a mix of PhDs in laymen and they come together and discuss topics.
So like to these people and they cover everything.
They just pick different topics.
This is why I like them.
It's earned by Steve McGrady and that dude in the...
How did they get started?
This guy and Steve McGrady.
You know who that is.
That was a better one.
So Nick of the...
He's got a tiny tip.
I'm a tiny type.
He brings on these laymen.
The people there.
So Steve McGrady is a neighbor.
He walked on a neighbor's nipple so he's beating Steve.
He knows what he's talking about.
But he's more of a layman inside.
So he has all these people that he knows.
He's built.
Oh, he's a layman too, okay.
Yeah, Steve McGrady helps.
So there's no actual host.
So what it is is it's a group of people who are like minded.
And not everyone is...
I don't know.
How do I just get this?
The little mix of atheists, agnostics, religious people.
They study everything from sociology,
to ecology, to physics, to geometry.
And what they do is they meet and they hold these debates
of each other just for the simply the fact that debating.
They don't pick a winner.
They do these debates to get information out though.
Because they believe...
Let's keep people interested in the topic.
So let them decide.
And so what they do is they present two ideas.
A yes and a no.
The same idea.
And then they just let them debate.
Can you show me your example?
What's the good one?
Let me go to Steve's chair.
I think it's good.
I'm going to have a lot of charge.
Is this fashion the right dice is here again?
Yeah.
So it definitely cooled down.
It's not anymore.
Let's get up a minute.
It has this thing here.
Charging.
I'm going to go back.
Come on.
Oh.
Oh yeah.
So this is this.
This is Oats Studio though.
He does visual effects things.
But he did one for Anthem the game.
Oh.
But he does visual effects stuff in his lab.
And he does little trailers that are anything for 15 minutes.
So like 20 minute movies.
How many people are involved in these things?
Oh, he's an actual Hollywood dude.
He does this on the side.
This is his personal studio.
Can you commission him to make work?
You think he might be able to, but it's going to be expensive.
Because he's done AAA movies.
He's done like blockbusters and stuff.
Look, if I reckon I'll send you a thing to him on Discord.
Well, he does some amazing visual effects work.
Imagine Oats Studios like thing.
But then you have Kirk is that.
Kind of expanding the world.
The act for it, the voice actor.
What is this?
This is Steve's side channel.
But it's very similar route.
It's just not his mainstream topics.
This is more like he just covers everything.
Is there any science for this stuff?
A lot of it is more theology.
He does have a science.
Look at Jackson Oats.
This is a good one because it shows them.
So this is part of great debate community.
But this is something he has to know.
Greatest of sources.
But that's not how gracious things, gracious things like you said.
The Bible has to be written.
This dude, his name is Jackson Oats.
Or any doubt.
He has these more science-based channels.
That's not how you science.
Steve, Bob, the bill actually takes him easy.
If Jackson can't make it, he would be glad to come in.
Yeah, sure.
Why not, man?
Yeah, I'll give you a break.
What Jackson will do the longest way to move.
I don't get too many people in here.
Do you like Bill, right, Jeremy?
Bill?
Bill Lolo.
I don't know.
Bill Lolo is...
Bill Lolo, we came to Superstar where he decided to cover my channel.
And we didn't get over.
Nobody know nothing.
He doesn't like him, though.
He doesn't like him, though.
He's a great guy who can't help him.
You really love it, Chris.
Do you like the one?
Yeah, the crazy one.
He fights his dance.
We worked at a museum.
He's like, I don't hate the guy, but I hate what he pushes.
I hate he has actually used his students this.
Yeah, did you have Aaron Raw for our Raw on yesterday?
A couple days ago?
Yeah.
He's kind of like my kind of style.


# REC045.txt
Okay, so you have the signs of phonetics okay, yeah signs of phonetics that's your difference. Yeah, so there's
Closif nasal trill tap or flap
Fricked for cotta for cotta
Lighter of the cotta
Okay, then you have
Phonemes we have you have
Yeah phonemes more famous syllables you have words you have phrases you have
Sentences you have
Philosophy art science you have articulation. It's a
It's a great indication and I think we're missing an aspect of that
We're missing the internal aspect we don't express I think I want to use the dodeck to
Articulate that eternal internal and external expression but behavior
Any makes
There was this be
As simple a bowel system as you can get.
In fact, statistically as far as I know there are no natural languages.
You run three vowels.
We still want the goblins to be simple creatures.
They're not very advanced.
That's really not the stupid, but they're just not very advanced.
There is more of a fair chance that the bowel inventory will rise a little bit as we go.
So, now we go across those.
We have snails of hearts, ma, na, na.
We'll tell you the degree.
So, like, you'll outgrew your sounds.
I'll tell you the sound and the snow and your vessels.
The normal thing.
We also grill a rock.
Because, of course, it's a...
These are all actually fairly common sounds with only a few attention.
So, we also have, in all the same points of articulation,
we have a fricative series.
So, we have fa, sa, sha, ha, ha, ha, and ha.
We also have a lateral fricative because I'm an asshole.
There's always got to be something.
Yup, that's not.
And we also have a large...
These are types of cons.
And, as far as I'm concerned, you can do a lighter dark out.
It's a consonants.
So, those are the boring sets of the consonants.
But then, the sounds are really interesting.
So, we don't have any voices going into this section.
So, B and B are the same sound.
But, all the stops can be...
Unasparated, aspirated, or fringilized.
And so, that's where we're going to start getting into some of the more interesting things
that we're doing right at the outset.
Which is to say that there's already built into this a nice potentials or some aliphami.
So, all of these stops are going to be voiced...
Well, sorry, all the simple stops are going to be voiced between vowels.
And, the fringilized stops, as well as the fringial and glottal concepts,
are actually going to slightly front fat vowels.
So, that's rather than being odd.
After, say, a fringilized P.
So, odd will be pat.
Yeah.
So, we've got a little ass out in there.
The thing is, at this stage,
those speaker of a language would differentiate between those sounds.
Right.
So, like, technically in English,
the P at the beginning and end of the word pop
aren't actually pronouncing the same.
You probably don't hear it in English,
we don't care about that distinction.
So, the first thing we're going to do is
we're going to come up with a nice pronoun.
So, right now, I want a nice syllable vowel structure.
First one pronoun, second.
Oh, I should probably have one in there as it is.
First, second, third.
And, actually, I'm going to open it up.
It sure is pretty good.
So, is that her interlocutor?
So, it'll be up here.
So, that way it's easy to see.
All right.
So, syllable vowel.
We're sorry, consonant vowel.
What do you got, Shesh?
What do you think?
Is this really hard to read?
Oh, isn't it?
Let me make it clear.
I think it really isn't clear.
Yeah, there we go.
So, we want a consonant vowel.
And it can be more than one syllable,
although pronouns tend to be fairly simple.
Do we want an open mouth or do we want open mid?
I'm sorry.
I'm just thinking about how we're going to pronounce the vowel.
Oh, so, these...
Who was rounded?
You know, it's closed and unrounded.
It's also unrounded.
And we don't want to make it too complicated by starting off with vowels, right?
We want to start a consonant vowel.
Yeah, so, right now, I want this...
We're going to stick with the pronoun problem.
The syllable structure is going to be very simple.
Every syllable is just a consonant followed by a vowel.
But, we're going to make it much more complicated later.
Okay, so, why don't we do a nasal, an open mid, and then...
What?
Well, we only have an open back vowel.
What we could do...
How are some of these examples?
What's up?
How are some of these examples?
That's what they're trying to come up with now.
Okay.
Oh, they're coming up in language.
They're making a language.
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
So, we'll build a little consonant vowel system right now.
Just one.
Okay.
We can end this.
We can end this.
We can end this.
Yeah.
Because they already stored the...
Nothing.
So, she's coming up with the idea that some of these explain the system.
You're going to learn, like, so would that be me?
It's kind of like a storyboard.
You're going to be able to say this and...
Oh, this isn't going to work.
Oh, this isn't going to work.
Oh, my God.
She's coming up with the actual sounds.
And he's showing the...
The limitations of the consonant and the steps that are in the system.
So, do you want to put a language?
You probably want a different story.
Yeah, that's nice.
I think...
No, I think we should use English.
Because that's the meaning of the carcible.
I'm going to really really want to.
I reckon we're going to use English because I don't know about language.
Okay, enough for enough.
And I think I'm going to use those...
Those beeps and whistles.
Well, because we...
You know, those are fairly complex.
I could say I need to exaggerate here.
Because it's...
I could use the beeps and whistles as an abstraction.
Well, I could actually do it.
Depending on how big the scope is.
I could...
I could...
I could use...
The beeps and whistles as an abstraction.
Well, I could actually do it.
Depending on how big the scope is.
I could...
I could...
I could...
That'd be a kick-struggle, I guess.
Actual language.
I don't know how to do it.
How do you pronounce it?
This is like literally...
A sites.
He's doing a community job.
It's a social site.
So you're being a cultural item, you're being a linguist or a cultural anthropologist.
You're breaking that language in the context of culture.
I'm not sure that, but I really don't have to say it.
Oh yeah.
But a little saying.
You're in mouth-position.
This is like the actual thing.
Right, but then...
You have the...
The linguist aspect of it.
So you're building it, right?
But then you have the culture and the polygist aspect of
parsing language, how this language is expressed.
Expresses the culture, you know?
If you imagine like birds singing, right?
They tweak normally.
They tweak their energy, then they have a singing
as an expression, as a more intricate expression.
And as we're doing, when we're talking, we're singing.
We're in a way.
We're using grunts and whistles.
One grunts and...
I don't know.
Well, I get it.
Yeah, no, I get it.
Yeah, okay.
Right.
If I were to...
There we go.
Now we know our first few words.
Hold that back.
And just say, what if I...
Can I just...
Oh, be this and that.
Is that kind of that?
Listen, all of this and that.
So we need to make that sound good,
because anybody from familiar with critical role,
you'll remember that this is how you're going to have to
refer to rock,
because somebody is a grand pooba
to donate
a chargeable of this matter.
Wait, what?
Grand pooba to donate.
So, this one's going to be a role,
because it's going to be fancy.
So, it's more of a funding,
so that's kind of...
No, this is a...
There are four of them.
Yeah, I love it this.
Oh.
This is a building you're putting off to.
So, this is D&D.
So, it's basic language in D&D, but not falling.
No, this is a bullish note.
They do a goblin thing.
And...
No, this should be due on R.
It's similar to local people
who make a goblin language up for people who use...
Well, imagine if I had to do a language...
Some fancy.
D&D.
Well, I'm glad that it's no goblin.
But it's cool, though.
It's really awesome.
I love this breakdown.
It's actually a really good reference
for one of the languages.
And I make the language.
If I made a kickstarter, this should be a core.
Oh, it's already nice.
So, you can kind of get a grasp
of just how complex some of the language is.
Oh, yeah.
It goes into a complex.
It's hugely complex.
We got $2 for my ministry.
Hello.


# REC046.txt
They will be learning about the corpus language.
Now, every minor tiny faction, every little mongoose trading books they offer,
has its own alphabet for some reason.
But they are still capable of speaking English,
with a few ethnical words thrown in.
Swastula!
Or flounder.
The Grineas seem to have developed a really fucked up learning of English,
but the pronunciation of words changed to,
like the Surif, they have degenerated articulation.
Ah!
Oh!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Now, the corpus, you eat you, you eat.
I have no idea what happened here.
You must have seen corpus writing around.
That is actual English, only without a lot of X, Q,
and a different pronunciation of the letter C.
The spoken version, however, is really curious.
By doing this, the effectively elevated 13 letters,
half the sounds from the alphabet.
This creates a few problems to say the least.
For example, let me want to say, yes, we say, yay!
Which, okay, that sounds fun, but the problem is,
when we want to say, say, we say, yay!
If we want to say, yay, we say, yay!
If we want to say, sassy, we say, yay!
If we want to say, case, we say, yay!
Are you starting to see the potential problem?
Additionally, because of the limited rule of different sounds,
more complex words sound absolutely unpronounceable,
and however, here's an idea how they should say that.
Just listen to a two different people.
What's the big area there?
What the pet type is?
They are supposed to be saying the same thing, okay?
You'll be there!
You'll be there!
What the fuck?
I think it's either some regional necktune dialect
or the second person,
Design?
Maybe both.
Okay.
Damn, the corpus have really low records and standards these days.
That's how I got it.
Anyhow, because the corpus language is really confusing to a newcomer,
I will teach you some commonly used phrases,
which I gathered for your comments for this purpose.
Pay attention now.
Here we go.
You have to go in the top of each door to choose.

I'm going to say that it's all hidden.
I'm going to have to introduce you by now.
Really comments this thing.
We will be learning.
I saw him with his voice.
I'm wearing the comments on it.
You know?
About the chorus line.
Oh.
Well, I'll give this down there.
Wow.
Oh, quite nice down there.
Wait, can I get this?
What else do I want to show you?
Hmm.
Do you want to see more?
I don't know.
I'll have to go.
I'm going to get more for you.
Hmm?
You think I want to get more for you?
Yeah.
You guys need a Richard?
What's up?
You guys need a Richard?
I'll do this.
Are you sure they want to say it, lady?
Hmm.
Yeah, let's do this.
I need you.
I'll do something.
Are you sure you don't want to say anything?
Yeah, let's do something.
I'm not sure.
So, what scene do you have in mind in this storyboard?
So, I'm thinking of what I can do with it.
Not again.
So, you have a flash file, can you see?
You can find a watch.
Do I like that?
First, let's have some characters.
So, you're going to imagine coming with little slice of ice scenario.
You're telling, you're showing some aspect of the character.
Also telling.
You're interaction, but also too.
No, what I mean is like, well, they're outside of the inside.
You don't want to think about that.
It's not a torch, but among the...
The wolf, we're going to be doing slow-moaning.
We should flash out some areas too.
Okay, we need a torch and we need the passion.
I'll do something, I'll talk about it.
So, quick, put it out.


# REC047.txt
Okay, so imagine you have your bedroom, right?
Yeah.
It's for you, typically, you know.
But then you have a spouse, someone who's close to you,
and you spend a lot of time with your bedroom with you.
I can come in front of my, front of benefits.
Yeah.
Like, I spend a lot of time with her, and she just general the bedroom.
I play some games, and she's, you know, past the fun.
But then, there is the, you can also use a space
for a four person space, four-packed coop, you know.
You have the living room, and you have...
The spaces get larger and larger.
And I think at some point, because of cars,
because we've been divided, our spaces are going to spread out.
They're not close enough, and the smaller spaces have gotten further divided.
You do that, um, do the lack of knowing other people.
We don't know our neighbors anymore.
That's not inherently bad, but we can improve on that.
I think we can build communities and imagine,
like, you have a bunch of close friends in this space.
Not necessarily everyone here, you know well.
Yeah.
But you know enough people to where you can get together with,
like, people that are not nearby in the neighbors.
Um, but there's a sense of, there's a sense of trust in this community.
And you build it out, you build these spaces, right?
Remember the, and then the community space, the, uh,
the, the, what do you call it?
The, um, the community center, the hearth, and the hearth.
The, uh, community hearth, I suppose.
And you have, um, one person standing on one end.
And the other person standing on that end.
And they can both clearly see each other's faces.
There's no expressions.
Yeah, it's not a big space.
But 2020 vision, I can see you maybe imagine across the yard.
Right?
I can see your face, you can see mine.
That's like an ideal, middle ground area.
But then there's a larger space.
That, huh?
Let's say 30, maybe 40 people.
40 is pushing it.
30 is like a good middle ground.
And then maybe 25, maybe 12, 12, 12 is too small.
24.
24 people or...
Yeah.
Because, uh, typically.
I don't know.
This is 17th deportation.
28 people.
28.
Uh, population is...
About.
You don't need that.
Let's say 20 billion.
Okay.
But you have this large, immense structure.
And even though it's really large, there's a lot of retail space there.
20 billion is nothing.
No, no.
We can fit about 10 and a 700, but I said we can put them in a few.
Yeah, so it's 20 billion people, but it's not crowded.
It's just a pessimist.
I don't know if I suppose we lost people.
Key.
I mean, I think you break things too much down the pessimist if you're optimistic.
No, I mean, I think that typically people imagine that overpopulation leads to overcrowding,
but it doesn't necessarily.
We're going to hit the cap, we're going to hit the peak.
And then, I mean, people more people will be born.
The population will steadily rise, but it's not going to rise as sharply as people believe.
And in that rise, we can build more.
I mean, like building.
We like expressing ourselves through architecture.
So, building will persist.
You will build populations slowly over time, but it's not going to be out of control.
It will be totally fine.
Because these spaces are going to socialize, but there's the space above it.
So, there's the community space, but then there's a lot of them.
I wouldn't say a disk, but a larger surface area they work with for the either warehouses and stuff,
all the manufacturing, the big stuff.
And then the stuff above that, that's, and it's all automated, right?
And the stuff above that, that's where scientists gather, that's where people gather.
I mean, they're in both sections, but this is where they gather the big projects.
Imagine you're at the top of the Alice Village.
You have a almost like a curved disk that is to the curvature of the planet, right?
It comes over like a, oh, it's an attack.
This top piece is an attachment point for the sphere that encapsulates the planet.
But it's not attached to the top, it's attached to the sides.
They launch rockets and they're in stuff.
Because they don't know what the moon does.
The moon that is of less mass than their planet.
No, I'm more mass.
It has to be more mass, otherwise you're not going to have a fellowship.
The planet ship.
So it is, this planet is a moon.
The people, the one that, technically, they live on as a moon to this orbiting body that's unknown to them.
But there's a layer like, imagine like a sphere, right?
You have this, you have the external surface when you have interior.
What if the interior is pulled back a little bit like you're intruding it?
No, extruding it.
Extruding it in words.
And you have this layer like a crust, right?
But the crust is made up of energy.
Many of all the resources.
Imagine this thing being a little,
geez, six times.
I don't know how much, 32 times the size of the planet?
So that's something you're not going to get out of the scale.
The scale, yeah, the scale for weight or density to mass ratio.
Like, what is, for moving the planet from the point they're at to the center,
to have it be completely lit.
Centrope the galaxy.
Did I, did I not explain that?
No, I mean like, you don't need it to be literate on that port.
No, I do want to keep it scientific, or literate.
I don't, okay, so the sun, right?
But the amount of energy we need to move to planet, that ain't shit.
Compared to the amount of sun, amount of energy the sun can go off.
So you gather using a Dyson swarm.
You gather energy and you store it into the sphere.
Imagine there being amount of starscape in the sky,
but in an array, like a swarm or a cluster,
a group of these, these, these, these godex that have been released by the sun,
released by the orbiting Dyson swarm.
They are the densest possible energy source,
that humans could ever conceivably be creating without creating a black hole.
Yeah.
They're stable.
They don't, they don't explode in the black holes.
They're, maybe it's a threshold for defense,
threshold for protection, like batteries, you know.
They're not built to explode, they're not built to be optimal for energy storage,
because energy dissipates, right?
It heat loss through the movement.
So what if you convert all the energy you've got in the sun into solid structures,
into ecos empty square?
You need, it's cost energy to do this,
but the cost to save is more worth it than losing energy,
all the energy all together.
You're spending energy from the sun to build these things,
permanently encapsulated energy, permanently,
you are preparing for the infinite,
preparing for the everlasting universe,
through our imagination anyway.
Because if you gather all the energy in the galaxy,
all the energy in the galaxy of our neighboring star,
we could live for a similar infinite amount of time.
So,
we could live for a similar infinite amount of time.
We could live for a similar infinite amount of time.
We could live for a similar infinite amount of time.
We could live for a similar infinite amount of time.
We could live for a similar infinite amount of time.
We could live for a similar infinite amount of time.
We could live for a similar infinite amount of time.
We could live for a similar infinite amount of time.
We could live for a similar infinite amount of time.
We could live for a similar infinite amount of time.
We could live for a similar infinite amount of time.
We could live for a similar infinite amount of time.
We could live for a similar infinite amount of time.


# REC048.txt
You know, it's expanding faster, and that's one of the things.
I'm hoping. I don't know.
But I'm hoping that's not-
You're going to need some little cosmology models, or off now.
Hmm?
I mean, some of the models that we've been using to run on understanding of cosmology and physics in our own.
Well, if it's just our understanding of this thing is wrong.
No, no, no. So-
No, no, no. I mean, okay.
Imagine perspective, right?
Imagine like you're away from the galaxy.
Imagine you're farther out, and you're seeing this perspective, this decalency.
All these things moving away from each other.
Imagine-
Is there truly an engine?
If there's an engine, is there something else?
What?
Imagine-
Okay, imagine-
Imagine if it's expanding faster.
Imagine the universe has to expand.
Eventually, the galaxies-
I know it expands.
But imagine like a bubble.
And when these galaxies reach the edge of the bubble, that's where they stop.
That's very unreadable.
That's where they all gather.
I mean, it'd be nice if there was, but I guess that's-
That's the most diverse thing that's-
Well, we've figured out that all the signs on us, we used-
We used that the universe expanding at a solid rate.
Okay, so how do-
Let's pick it down.
Let's pick it down for myself, I guess.
What are you trying to break down?
What are you-
How do we know-
How do we know-
What is-
I want to know the theory behind it.
I want to know if the process of which people have to do is set this thing up.
What do you mean, that's-
That's where you want to expand it?
Yes.
So we've understood the process and then asked what questions.
We-
We use the very many ways we can make the way to each other.
So the distance between stars, we're measuring the distance that keeps getting larger and larger.
Stars and galaxies, you know, the quasars and-
We use one of them from now.
So what we did is we figured out-
We analyzed how much distance we gained from us in the moon.
We did that to come up with a basic speed limit, which is pretty much skill-like.
Using that as a basis, we ran-
From no distance from us to the next nearest body.
We then waited and re-shot that result, calculated that result and-
We plugged it in and we developed what we-
We intended we consider this speed limit.
Okay, and then we found out it is-
Speed limits were actually expanding as fast as-
Something we're not- something we're not considering.
Something we're not considering in this whole aspect.
So imagine-
You got-
No, hang on, hang on.
What?
If you pop up a gray matter, I'm done with the conversation.
Pop up a-
How about dark matter?
No, no, not dark matter, no dark matter.
Okay, so imagine our galaxy, right?
It's rotating, it's spinning.
It's moving through space.
Our planet is not-
I'm not still settling.
No, it's moving through space.
At the same time, the galaxy, the galaxy is moving through space too.
Yeah.
Imagine if all these galaxies are not-
They're not-
They're not moving further away.
They're actually rotating like a-
In the center of a-
Super mega black hole.
In the center of our galaxy.
In the center of our-
Our universe, I should say.
We're just stars in an ocean.
And the ocean isn't-
Forever lost, it's-
Oh, where we are, where we're stuck.
But if the-
Then moving away, it's not-
Because we live in a very short period of time, right?
Imagine that for billions of years.
And you see this succession of-
This rotation on the-
Oh, the super mega black hole is the center of everything.
There's super mega black-
Mega black holes in the middle of our-
Our-
Our-
Our little galaxy.
And then there's a-
Super mega huge black hole in the middle of our-
Our-
Our universe.
Moving us, we've only been destroyed by-
And that's there.
There is say-
It's just a black hole.
We're-
We are beyond the threshold.
I can affect us.
It's so far away.
Here's my hypothesis.
Because-
Remember that the-
The-
The black hole we have in the center of our galaxy, right?
It's-
Well, it's not-
It's not the galaxy.
Hmm?
It's not in the center of our galaxy.
No, no, not this one.
The-
The smaller one.
The smaller one is in the center of our galaxy.
We know that for sure.
We go to other galaxy to observe that-
There are-
They have a super mega black hole.
Super mega-
Super massive black hole in the center of the galaxy.
And then-
Because it's so far away.
Because it's at the black hole.
We-
We can-
In-
In the range of our-
Of our-
Of our-
Of our perception, we can understand the gravitational pull.
We can make sense of it.
There's mathematics that prove it.
And I think you could prove it if we went away from the-
Okay, we're not at the center of the galaxy.
We're not-
We're not-
I know we're not, but I think we misunderstand.
We're-
We're not-
Seeing enough time past-
To fully grasp the idea that there is a super mega-
Super mega intergalactic black-
Black hole.
In the center of our universe.
So these are the thing about black holes.
They give out energy every once in a while.
But if it's so far away.
If you were to register it.
We have this radiation everywhere.
And this is a very big spike.
So the spike of radiation that they give off.
Typically, we do the amount of energy that they pull away.
Well, how far away would we be?
Well, we're not affected by radiation in the center.
They multiply as I know that.
But we put this in perspective.
We can detect this in small black holes.
So what you're saying is happening.
We've already experienced the pulse right now.
How frequent are the pulses?
Related to the mass.
It depends on the black hole.
What you're saying is, we've already seen some kind of a knowledge
that proves it exists.
Well, we're wanting persisted for just years,
just years as a growing species.
What are you talking about?
12,000 years.
It's really massive.
One more.
It's almost good.
I don't think you understand anything.
You're talking about a black hole that is large enough to encapsulate the Intel Universe.
It was large enough.
Just like ours.
It was large enough.
Or it could potentially be large enough.
But I don't think it will be.
Because it's always...
Imagine, okay.
So let's say that there is an antibody death in the Universe.
We will get there.
Well, yeah.
It's talking radiation.
It's a thing.
We're going to either get too far away to heat up.
We're going to get too far away to heat up.
But again, if this is...
If we're orbiting around a super mega intergalactic black hole
at the center of the Universe,
that means we won't get farther away.
We're just moving temporarily away from all these other planets.
Because we want to observe for so long.
We're moving away from other planets.
They're not all of them.
Some of them are moving closer to us.
Yeah, again.
They're rotating.
They're coming closer and farther away.
But how do you know that they're rotating?
They're moving away from us.
It's moving away from us.
We need to observe longer.
We want to see a small fraction of time.
We want to watch them move a little bit.
Relative to our location in the Universe.
It's like the vision...
Remember, let's never stand.
Remember, when we look to the stars,
we're looking into the past.
Yeah.
So we're watching it move.
But it's so slow that we want to proceed for so long
that we haven't seen the full procession of the Universe.
I think you just have an instant understanding of the science behind it.
So you're claiming that we're moving in a vertical pattern.
We're left to right.
We're right to left.
We're orbiting in any direction.
In like a traditional system.
It's like an atom.
We're orbiting a black hole that will be pulled in eventually.
We're going to want to see it right now.
If you're close enough, you could pull that.
No, so here's a way you would see eventually
that something is being pulled that direction.
So imagine this.
Have you seen the visual for black holes?
Imagine a top surface, right?
Top surface.
You have the center.
No, I think the tension is.
You'll pull the stuff in no matter how big it is it's pulling stuff in
and it doesn't matter how far away it is.
We would see evidence of that pool on something.
It wouldn't just be...
It just stops.
What if it's hard to see the pool if you're only experiencing a small section of space?
It would still be noticeable.
If we can notice the pool off of these small ones, we would definitely notice.
What if that's...
What if we misunderstand?
Okay.
So we can order into it.
What if we're saying dark energy and dark mass is not a thing?
We can only absorb and penetrate these from now on with smaller black holes.
So we already know what we're looking at.
What?
We already know what we're looking for.
We've already seen this happen with smaller black holes.
So what you're saying, we would see some kind of phenomena of its existence.
Because we know how black hole functions.
We've seen what happens when it pulls things in.
We've seen the effect that it has on follow bodies.
Right, but can we observe the effects of other bodies on a structure that big?
It would be very noticeable.
You would have whole galaxies tilting.
Let me try to...
Okay, it's like...
If you live back in the day.
And you're looking at the sky and you're watching a move.
But you're so far away that...
You're just not grasping it.
We've seen how...
So this is a good way to look at it is...
Though I have to look down on the air.
We see the adult moving in the air.
And you have what you're describing.
You would see it moving in a general direction.
Because right now we're expanding in every direction.
If what you were proposing is true, we would be expanding in only so many directions.
It would be a direction of pool.
It doesn't matter how massive it is, you would see a pool on it.
How do you see a pool if we don't know the direction it's moving?
I mean, we've seen a procession of nearby galaxies.
It doesn't have light.
Literally, it pulls everything.
Nothing escapes the black hole.
You would see a pattern of phenomena or it doesn't feel right.
It would be like having six flashlights finding one direction and one side shining slightly off.
It's still buried on the yellows, but those are distinct change.
Because it won't be uniform with the rest of the uniforms.
There would be a spot on the uniforms where there is something different.
Why does that be different?
Because you're being pulled into the black hole.
The black hole is impassive.
How do we experience a difference if this is only a perspective we had?
We haven't had a chance to analyze the gravitational pull of other galaxies.
We can predict them.
We can predict them.
We can mathematically predict them.
We can't measure the galaxy.
Measure the gravitational pull.
We can look at a matter of this.
So you see this, right?
This basic visual, right?
Yeah, you saw this already before.
So imagine you're having a black hole in the order here.
Yeah.
But this is actually not accurate to the flash space hash.
But why is it an accurate?
We have a graduate.
Okay.
So it is accurate to read.
It's halfway there.
You have the right pull.
This is the right visual for it.
But it's not pulled to the downside.
It's pulled to the middle.
It's like a...
Okay, so...
The space is 2D, right?
The space is on this side.
It's like...
So here's the thing.
You can't have a black hole in something above them below it.
That's not how that works.
If you have a black hole, it is...
That's for the board.
That's for the viscous.
It's like...
A black hole pulls from every side.
There's not like it only pulls from one side like this.
Right, right.
It does pull from every side.
But this is the middle.
Imagine like...
You throw a...
You throw a...
You throw a...
You throw a...
You throw a floating object into water.
Imagine like you're throwing...
You throw a bottle cap on the water.
It floats.
If you get a...
A black hole, it literally strips and stretches metal.
You don't float.
You don't float.
It's pulling all directions, right?
Imagine it pulling towards the center.
It stretches immediately.
So as soon as you hit, you are immediately just throwing a ball.
Imagine you throw a ball...
A rubber ball in the water.
I think it's...
It floats itself.
It's not water.
You're right.
It's not water.
But imagine the ball...
Somehow, use your gravity.
It pulls its...
Pulls towards the center of the water.
The center surface.
The center surface.
There's a spot on the black hole.
The center...
I know, I know, there's not.
I mean, there is the middle.
There's the center mass.
This is pulling her direction.
But it's pulling towards the center of that space.
It's not like this.
It's more like it's raised a little bit.
It's in the center at this...
What you're proposing is...
If you have a black hole...
Imagine multiple black holes in the surface.
Imagine there's a bunch of them, right?
And then you have the one mega, mega super one in the middle.
You have...
Okay.
You wouldn't have anything left around if you'd be pulling everything in.
Our galaxy...
Our super mega black hole, doesn't it?
It's just a matter of distance.
It's a matter of scale.
This thing is so far away, it's hard to imagine.
But...
Okay.
I don't leave it there.
Let's place more.
Now, I think you're just overstretching again.
Alright.
That's fine.
It's your step off as this.
So...
So, like, if you had a black hole that heaps,
we would see a phenomenon from it.
There would be traces of it.
It's just like how we can detect the small ones.
We can detect them.
Because those fine traces that they do.
But it's like...
Okay, it's like...
We can't experience evolution of left time in the scale that we imagine.
And that we understand.
Right?
That...
There would be no exists.
Because...
It's too late over time scale.
Yeah.
So it's like...
The time scale is difficult to comprehend.
It's difficult for us to...
No, but the thing is we'd have a trace.
No matter how big there'd be some kind of trace.
So we'd have to find...
I'd have to find a trace to verify in this.
We'd have to find a mathematical principle that...
...articulates that this thing exists.
I think...
So, you're big as...
A theory of everything.
We won't have that yet.
No, it's not...
You don't mean everything.
You just need a way to explain how you're going to hype up through this realistic.
Well, it's not...
Okay, well...
So, it's not...
This is a black hole, right?
It's not multiverse.
It's not...
What do you call it?
It's not...
It's not...
You have a black hole, right?
This is the explanation on the grid stuff.
Okay.
No matter how far away you get...
...there is going to be...
...a visible thing.
Because if these ones that are like...
...maybe the size of this spec...
...if we were able to detect...
...we would be able to detect this.
Because the signs this...
Is there a hypothetical...
It's so easy to see.
Is there a hypothetical condition to which...
...a black hole could not be felt easily?
No, it's that size.
Because one of that size...
...you would have a whole...
It's about...
It's not a size about density.
And what if this thing is so dense that...
...it's zero?
That's not...
So...
You keep acting like it's not going to be pulling things in.
Something this big would literally have a blank spot in the universe.
We can only say so far.
Our light can only travel so far.
No, but it pulls in light.
You would see what those...
A spot with no light.
It's a good perspective, okay?
Like, not even light.
You would have a giant, massive spot of emptiness.
What if this universe has...
What if light has reached us yet?
What if this thing is so far away?
No.
Because if you don't...
If you travel so far, it's not light.
If the universe can eventually...
If it can farther and farther.
Imagine...
Imagine dark matter.
Traveling upwards.
Explore.
This structure.
What do you call it?
No, so it's not about light.
Not reaching it.
No matter where it is, it's going to be stolen by.
No matter where it is, we're going to see a spot of light.
No, I mean, it sucked it in and took in light already.
Imagine that it does light.
You'd be said it only goes so full.
So there's going to be stuff that's on that boundary edge.
What if we start seeing about your edge in like a hundred thousand years?
Ten thousand years?
We'll be seeing it, though.
As massive as you were talking about, we would have seen it already.
What if it hasn't started?
What if, because it's so far away, we haven't seen the light yet.
And the light would reveal that it is, in fact.
It would be already visible.
It's like how we can look at a story.
But again, time scale.
It's like...
All right, I find it a better way to argue with this thing.
That's not good enough.
Because right now, what you're talking about is it moving on a separate time scale.
And right now, we only have one time scale we're done done.
You need to have...
You need to have a longer first perspective in human time.
No, not a longer perspective, but you need to have a way to show this other time scale.
I know what you're trying to get at.
We're trying to argue that we just haven't experienced enough time to experience one of these phenomena.
What I'm all hearing is, that might be true, but no matter how long it's been,
there will be signs of trace.
Everything lives in trace somewhere.
But black holes gather all the traces up and gobble them up there.
Yeah, but we would see that devastation illustrated.
We might see the light, but we couldn't, because it's not there yet.
To our background now.
You keep getting fixated on that.
Okay.
So there's light around it.
The radiation, right?
The chocolate radiation talked about this disease.
Well, we'd see this.
A radiation who's slower than light, doesn't it?
Oh, sorry, this is worse.
No, so what I'm trying to explain is...
There's always going to be a trace somewhere, huh?
Yeah, I'll walk if you don't.
I didn't get to pizza.
There's always going to be...
You can't move through...
I'm thinking about how we're going to be able to track the video of the whole galaxy to what it was sort of.
We're going to have to track the whole time, because it seems like we're going to be able to track the video.
We're going to be able to track the video.


# REC409.txt
I think we got ourselves pretty interesting game.
So this is where I cannot spend my goblin.
Sorry, how?
Oh, I can talk to it then.
I can communicate with it.
I can try to be a friend of the goblin.
How do I be a friend after you're doing that much massacre?
That much deadly violence?
Um, you just tell them to hold people hands.
Oh my god, what have you done?
You monsters?
You killed all of them all!
Oh yeah, you can always do that out.
I have taken a dump.
What have you done?
Honestly, what I always do is just when we move people in back up,
just tell them you won't put it in your pocket.
Just tell them you're the nice one.
I have to come with a bear excuse to actually take me dump.
That's funny, but it doesn't only add to me.
I mean, maybe it's good.
Maybe it works.
It's just fucking good.
I just drank too much.
I didn't realize.
I would just say like...
No, I mean, I did get drunk.
That's what it was in real life.
And you guys made it so I'd take a dump.
It's like, what the fuck?
No, I got drunk on my mind.
I didn't realize that you'd gone and slayed an entire goblin horn
because it was past 4Cup the entire night.
You know, I would just say like you were doing something for prayer or some shit.
We'll just play it through a noble and I took a rest because I've been walking.
I mean, it could be drinking too, but it could be that.
I don't know.
We'll figure it out.
Either way, it's interesting.
It's a very interesting situation.
Because you've killed those entire family.
It's not a family.
It's not a family.
It's not a family.
It's not a family.
It's not a family.
It's not a family.
It's not a family.
It's not a family.
Well, if it's traditionally being deed, then there's a lot for good and neutral.
Let's just say right now, he's probably pretty compliant.
Unless he racists, they're making all evil goblins.
No, I just might carry the way.
He's just there for the cash.
He was told he could 500 if he could cause the cash on.
So he's going to go kill the cash on.
Well, that's how I do it.
He's the chaotic neutral.
So he's doing what he's just there to get cash, to go do it with a shit.
He doesn't really have the tribe thing because this is the thing that they send them out.
And then you come back after a while, a bunch of crap.
This is how the tribe stays mobile.
Instead of settling them down, maybe so often they send out people and then they bring back a bunch of shit.
I feel like dealing with raiding style but slightly more legal.
Yeah.
That's going to be fun.
Next week, next week, next week, next week, next week.
I'm going to not be next week and I'm just going to smoke.
I'll just make a beer too, but not that much.
Honestly, what I do is I get one beer and I just want to throw it out.
That's not a bad idea, actually.
I still enjoy beer but I don't agree with the fact that I don't like the drug.
That's not fun.
That's interesting.
I love that thing.
It's so cool.
I have more inside so when we're done with this, I can get the fresh right for sure.
I see how it's showing us.
I want to just come back over so you don't have to sit on the side.
We can put it on and move you or something.
Yeah, it works.
We don't have to freeze it in.
I'm putting that inside, actually.
Oh, it's like that.
It's like this.
It's like this.
It's like this.
Thank you.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
I'm so curious.
Oh, this is so hard.
It's pretty cool.
It's like a fucking dog.
Let's see.
It's lifting.
Oh.
One more.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
It must be freezing.
oh
Okay, that's it.

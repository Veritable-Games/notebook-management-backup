So when the player pulls right trigger or left trigger as they're running, they will leap upwards, kind of jump up to grab.
So this plays really well into the movement system.
I kind of encourage you to grab before the grab is tied to the leap, so you grab as you jump.
And this works really well for the encouraging navigation normally.
You're pulling triggers to leap in a direction instead of A for jump.
It's the right trigger and left trigger.
And if you're climbing, you're using right trigger and left trigger to climb, right?
But then you get to a point where you reach the max height of this particular path.
So you're holding right trigger, hanging on.
And then now you can look around with the left stick and the right stick.
And then you can use left trigger to jump to confirm a leap towards a particular obstacle.

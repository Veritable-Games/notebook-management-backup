The form of self, but the self has changed, the self hasn't died.
And I mean this very literally.
The brain decays over time, within the same work, it can't persist, it falls apart, it's
tissue, it's brain matter, it's DNA only has half life so long.
But hypothetically, before decay begins, you introduce artificial neurons, artificial
neurons that don't assume the role of existing neurons, but instead they allow existing
neurons to attach onto themselves.
You're melting, you're artificial with your organic, your organic and artificial work
together to form the full brain and eventually because the human mind changes every seven
years.
And imagine that decade, our several decades, hundred years, two hundred years, maybe a thousand
years, the brain persists and slowly changes over time and eventually you're using more
and more of those artificial neurons and it's not a detriment to the brain because the
self persists, your consciousness persists.
That's like, there is no such thing as unconsciousness really, it's more of an abstract idea but
if the perception of oneself moment to moment, you feel as you are, you feel yourself,
you are still you, now if hypothetically you remove the body and you copy it, literally
speaking, the you that wise is gone and the you that is is, but you can have two
simultaneous sets that's making copies and talking more about like a gradual replacement
of neurons, the steady process of losing yourself to time, but not entirely because you're
also, as you recall, hold memories, you're bringing them back into new neurons as they shift
around in the brain, and you're doing this again for the artificial eyes back to the
brain, and you're using our energies over and over again, now you go, it's understandable,
temo, ciferous, the cyborg, the former cyborg, the self, he is, he was not was,
he is not was, he was in the past, but he is, he is now, he has not changed, he has,
changed naturally how my god brain showed up a little bit,

The first people who lived here named themselves.
Across the continent, in hundreds of languages, the word for people, or the first people, was what they used.
Other people existed, but the continent was vast and travel slow.
There were no horses and wouldn't be for a length.
There was no single name for all.
Then from across the sea came a new other people who brought with them great and terrible
things.
They too had a name for themselves in their own language, but they also brought a name
for the first people, Indians.
We are in the future from this past and you in the future from my present, possibly the
far future.
And the word Indian may have just made you uncomfortable.
So let's talk about words.
Words are what we make them.
Without the words surrounding them, without brains to interpret them, words are but whispers
of wind.
It's a word's utility to the speaker and the reaction of the listener that causes words
to be born and to live and to die.
Long after its first use in the new world, the early British and American empires needed
a word to collectively describe the first people.
And Indian, despite its confused origins, was that work.
As the empires expanded, there was terrible conflict.
The first people found themselves decimated and scattered.
Many forcibly moved to reservations, land unknown with others unknown, needing to act
as one new group to survive, to hold on to any sovereignty.
As the world progressed from horses to steam to electricity, the nature of conflicts changed.
Fewer guns and germs, more mines and laws, but the first people were now a tiny minority
in the land, while also a multiplicity of groups.
For comparison, there are about 200 countries in the world.
Within the United States, the reservation's number more than 300.
Within and without those areas of special sovereignty, there are more than 500 federally recognized
tribes, each with a different name.
To win the minds of the majority, to get laws securing sovereignty.
Hundreds of different names for different groups is not helpful.
A collective name, one clear in the minds of the majority, was needed, a name useful for
unity.
In the time of civil rights, American Indians, shortened to Indians, was, despite its confused
origin, and that name, for war, birds are what we make them.
And we can unmate them, as I write this script looking at the past toward you in the future.
I will bet that future history will unmate India in favor of Native American or something
else.
You know, if this has happened, but here, as part of working on this series, I've traveled
to many reservations to see them and to talk to the people who live in them.
On reservations, the word Indian is still used without hesitation or negative connotation,
used as identity, not universally, but near it.
You, like me, may be surprised to hear that, given the words confused origins, but words
are what we make them, and Indians have made the word theirs.
Now as for Native American, while preferred by some, there exists in others a strong dislike
and resentment of the name.
The word created to explain this dislike was passed on to me, and the only way to explain
fully is to pass it on to you.
So the dislike comes from over inclusivity.
I know, I know, I know.
So let's stay thoughtful and examine what this word was created to communicate.
For at least 300 years, Indian has meant the first people in this part of the world separated
at first, but thrust into a shared history, this clear, it is sharp.
The word Native American, less so.
It can include everyone from the top to bottom of two continents, a vast number of different
cultures, and current day goals, and concern.
The histories of North, Central, and South America are as divergent as the histories of
Asia, Europe, and Africa.
To call a person from here, here, or here a native afro-eurasian would be so over-inclusive
as to make it difficult for that human to strongly identify with, or rally others under,
so it goes for Native American.
Additionally, it can feel like yet another thing, forced from the outside.
Talking to people about this project over the last five years, revealed a strong correlation.
The closer a person had ever been to a reservation, the more likely they would use India.
The farther, the more likely they would use the word Native American.
And that's understandable.
Is Indian okay?
Maybe.
But Native American told people off, and it's useful to accept concern and sensitivity
as an outsider.
But this creates an unstable balance between insider and outsider use of a word.
If the majority hesitates over a word, it slides into uncomfortability, or worse.
If the majority decides a word is unacceptable, then it comes.
Groups should be able to name themselves, but when they're small, they often can't.
The word used to describe themselves, outsiders, through sheer numbers.
The world we live in, at the most noble of our ordinary.
It feels like this is just how...
It's a great amount of information about plants and animals.
They could make complicated tools that required years of careful training and very fine motor
skills.
Their bodies compare to our athletes today, just because of their daily routines, and they
lived a rich social life within their tribe.
Survival requires so many skills that the average brain volume of early modern humans might
even have been bigger than it is today.
Nature, but then something changed, and in an incredibly short amount of time, we terraformed
this panace and designed it to fit out.
As far as we know, with the first beings to awaken and completely take over a planet,
the transition from hunting and gathering to farming and building was so breathtaking
that many of our ways of thinking about the world are no longer useful.
One of our most outdated ideas is that the most commonly used calendar in the world insists
that we live in the year 2016.
This distorts our view of our own history and makes it harder to understand who we are
as a species, and just how far we've come in an incredibly short amount of time.
So maybe it's time to choose a year zero for humanity.
A year zero that truly represents us as a species and includes all cultures.
A year zero that marks when we began building our own world on top of the old one.
Five, it was five forty years ago.
Never before it.
Never before in history have there been so many people on earth
as right now.
Our numbers have skyrocketed from 1 billion in 1800 to 2.3 billion in 1940, 3.7 billion
in 1970 and 7.4 billion in tooth.
Iran managed it in ten if people on the other side of the globe can live a good life.
And we are getting there, the percentage of people living in extreme poverty.
You sure?
You sure?
Didn't have to start from scratch.
Start.
It took to.
We're not special.
We just had a head start.
It went hence.
This is true for every country.
In the west we tend to overlook progress in other regions of the world, but actually most
of the world's countries have made it to the fourth stage.
Just look at Bangladesh.
In 1971 the average woman had seven kids, but 25% of them would die before the age of
five.
In 2015 the mortality rate was down to three.
Fills lonely from time to time.
When we have no one to sit next to at lunch, when we move to a new city, or when nobody
has time for us at the weekend, but over the last few decades this occasional feeling
has become chronic for millions.
In the UK, 60% of 18 to 34-year-olds say they often feel lonely.
In the US, 46% of the entire population feel lonely regularly.
We are living in the most connected time in human history, and yet an unprecedented number
of us feel isolated.
Being lonely and being alone are not the same thing.
You could be filled with bliss by yourself and hate every second surrounded by friends.
Loneliness is a purely subjective individual experience.
If you feel lonely, you are lonely.
A common stereotype is that loneliness only happens to people who don't know how to talk
to people, or how to behave around others.
But population-based studies have shown that social skills make practically no difference
for adults when it comes to social connections.
Loneliness can affect everybody.
Onks when it comes.

But population-based studies have shown that social skills make practically no difference

Loneliness can affect everybody.
Money, fame, power, beauty, social skills are great personality.
Nothing can protect you against loneliness because it's part of your biology.
Loneliness is a bodily function like hunger.
Hunger makes you pay attention to your physical needs.
Loneliness makes you pay attention to your social needs.
Your body cares about your social needs because millions of years ago it was a great indicator
of how likely you were to survive.
Natural selection rewarded our ancestors for collaboration and for forming connections
with each other.
Our brains grew and became more and more fine-tuned to recognise what others thought and felt,
to form and sustain.
The social bonds being social became part of our biology.
We were born into groups of 50 to 150 people.
Which you usually stayed with for the rest of your life.
Being enough calories, staying safe and warm or caring for offspring was practically
impossible alone.
Being together meant survival, being alone meant death.
So it was crucial that you got along with others.
For your ancestors the most dangerous threat to survival was not being eaten by a lion,
but not getting the social vibe of your group and being excluded.
To avoid that, your body came up with social pain.
Pain of this kind is an evolutionary adaptation to rejection.
A sort of early warning system to make sure you stop behaviour that would isolate you.
Your ancestors who experienced rejection as more painful were more likely to change their
behaviour when they got rejected and thus stayed in the tribe while those who did not
got kicked out and most likely died.
That's why rejections hurt and even more so why loneliness is so painful.
These mechanisms for keeping us connected worked great for most of our history until humans
began building anew world for themselves.

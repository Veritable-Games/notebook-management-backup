does this really hurt?
what are you trying to do?
well, watch moist
trying to visualize that better
So what are you trying to map out a space a little
secretively?
Imagine designing architecture and then designing interactions.
So you make like pinch points for so you have one point of interaction.
Points this is a door, this is a corridor, this is a window.
Are we going to talk to them?
Yeah, I've got them here.
I'll use a college conference.
So we spoke to the dialogue instead of the mapping.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's take a break to name the player enterers.
Okay, now we'll map them.
There's a little sheet comes to the door.
She comes to the box.
So what is she saying?
I'm going to let you see the door.
Oh, thanks so much.
Oh, you're right.
Thanks so much.
Thanks, Heads up on it.
Thanks, Heads up on it.
So he did texture, or whatever you guys should choose somehow?
Yeah.
She kind of lightly, if she about now I can't actually do it.
But she kind of, she kind of, she, kind of, tingly, she says loud.
But we're here.
Hey, thanks so much, or whatever.
But she's not going to, it's not yelling, it's really, we're trying to, uh,
we're supposed to speed, we're only speaking loudly, you are announcing.
Uh, that's anyway.
We're going to shoot from there.
Okay, so thanks for having me.
We'll just, uh, place over.
Okay.
We have to attack there.
Hold it down.
So we're not taking all that.
Hold it down.
Shoot.
Texted.
Where's the texted?
On the texted.
Uh, there's some extra.
Uh,CT.
That's a nice message.
你知道 no.
about the text it.
Yeah.
Very dramatic.
Um,ה.
Rem богateloom.
Rem богateloom.
Hey Marianne. And cherished you
I'm gonna finish this thing next.
What would she say to her ex?
Come on, we're gonna put it on.
We're gonna say, yeah, no problem.
Yeah, no problem.
I'm just gonna play for her.
There are no worries.
Yeah, no worries.
No problem.
No problem.
No problem.
No problem.
No problem.
No problem.
No problem.
No problem.
No problem.
No problem.
No problem.
Okay, I'm at the, I can't breathe out.
I'm gonna have to work this.
I think I'm a lot more excited about building a space and then building an island around it.
It doesn't make sense.
What's up?
I think I'm a lot more interested in building a space and then building an island around it.
Okay.
I'm gonna try to map out something on.
Slide my eye.
Slide my eye.
Slide my eye.
Slide my eye.
Slide my eye.
Slide my eye.
Slide my eye.
Slide my eye.
Slide my eye.
Slide my eye.
Slide my eye.
Slide my eye.
Slide my eye.
Slide my eye.
So I'll be the thing that we're going to need to figure out, and now that we'll access
all the players who are in their field, they'll basically leave the office.
So we can just, we'll do something for you to figure out.
So quick, quick fast, then.
Go in and stare.
See the, see the personal space, this is, this is an aerosized area.
It's open, it's relatively open, it's like a porch, but not quite a porch.
It's one of the social space.
It also, it goes at the therapy, therapy's up there, you're shocked with friends in here.
Imagine like the coffee shop.
We're hanging over there.
Just, not showing you how to catch it.
She's walking through the space.
Going down to the second floor.
There is no door upstairs.
There is no door upstairs.
They're on the second floor.
And they walk down the stairs to get the first floor to get the door, and then they go out.
So there's no door upstairs.
It wouldn't say that we have to walk through the room.
You're right.
So, you have, you have, you have a door to the space.
You also have the immediate, but it's an open door.
It's like a patio.
Right?
And you have, it's like a little, little section of space to your own.
I mean, I got, you see some things there, like a umbrella.
Yeah, some stuff that's used frequently, like, outdoors-wise.
Yeah.
It's like a...
So, no, what I mean is...
A welcome back.
I think the umbrella is coming down.
They would have a door lead again, but they're also there.
There's the direct exit out of the building.
Yeah.
So that's what they do.
You go out through this door here.
It's above the stairs.
It has like a little area.
Like a small section of space.
And you have stairs to go down.
And then there's...
There's stairs to the outside.
You can go to the opening area.
Because that's...
You can go down through your fights or stairs or whatever.
And on each, the top piece of each fight of stairs, there's a little door in the door.
It's the place.
It's like that.
I guess there's every other staircase actually.
Is that...
Or every 3rd, 4th, 5th?
I'm thinking how big it is.
You just sit as it's used to.
Two.
Two, sure.
Yeah, you're right.
Two.
Or not everyone actually.
Because you're right downstairs.
Yeah.
Okay.
So there's one staircase there.
One staircase there.
It's a little...
With a little abrupt, little smaller piece of the doorway.
And if that were you just keep walking down.
If you didn't want to.
Okay.
Like a...
Teams, I wish you could visualize it.
I mean, as soon as you're rising, I said the stairs would go down to the door.
Okay.
Okay.
So it should be the way.
Bye.


# REC002.txt
There was a staircase, going from the second floor, going down to the first and through the first into the shared space between two apartments.
It's like a, um, between two or three of the importance between the six apartments, maybe seven.
It's like a small social area, it's not.
There's not a lot of people that are there, but these smaller,
where you put in these together, they top open now inside the side.
They're like apartments, but they're a little more open.
Uh, more patios.
More...
What are we aligned or who is off to the aligned?
What are we aligned?
Okay, so that's gonna affect the space.
And who is on the line?
They're in kind of an augmentation.
It's not like square spaces, it's more like interesting spaces.
Spaces that are very inside.
Interesting spaces, not a big constraint, though, because...
Well, imagine.
Okay, this one is like...
Remember the size, this one.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Okay, you have the...
Absolutely, you need the draw.
Yeah.
Varying sizes, spaces.
Okay, so interesting space.
I have to define the spaces.
And then make it both in there.
I'll do that.
You can't just go interesting space towards the door.
Yeah, I can't even write.
The door is gonna shoot themselves.
You're right, oh my god.
Okay.
I'll take a few minutes on that.
As well as organize all this shit.
Well, you're gonna have to figure out a way to conceptualize it in walls.
Because you can't just tell me the concept of this.
I mean, an interesting place.
Yeah.
So, okay, this is gonna be interesting.
Another idea.
You're all quite quietly.
There you go.


# REC003.txt
Okay, so imagine the first interaction the player has. Outside of breaking outside of a little glass barrier that they're in, the protective shell.
They break out.
The interact, they basically get their movement, but then they have the ability to use aggression or anxiety.
They pop up on the left side of the right side as ice people are closer to.
You know, it's like they're, how comfortable are they?
They're closer to what?
They're closer to the people.
So imagine, if this is the only way the player has to express themselves, they're going to be happy, happy, happy.
It's scary, it's scary, it's scary, so.
But it's not like immediate, it's more reaction-driven thing.
Like, you see a pop-up, you press it.
And it's like, oh, they've learned where the thing is.
So you show aggression and you show anxiety or whatever, and you keep your combined them.
So you show them the symbol, and then they do an action, and then they're supposed to encourage that.
Yeah, and then that means they react to that action.
So that's later on.
This is like, this is like a small interaction, a small preview of what's to come.
And then it might be just more and more complex, though, that it's to talk to people.
You're going to have to be careful about explaining that.
You'll see if we're going to grasp that.
Well, yeah, to add words to it.
Thank you.
I just want to make sure that you kind of have a way to express this to the player.
Yeah, so there's written language there, but it's also the Dodex.
Right side, right side.
Oh, those riddles.


# REC004.txt
dodex themselves? Yeah, all the same pattern. The pattern is different depending on the dodex.
Okay, so then it's a different pattern. The all different patterns, that's why it's so complex.
If you're trying to match all the patterns together, you've got a different feel about the kind of duration that you set up like that.
Okay, never mind, you know what, that's the complex. Let's go back. Let's just do one all the symbols, all the same on all the dodex.
Okay.


# REC005.txt
All the same.
The story will be a lot more.
Oh wait, they're all the same.
If they all the same don't exist, then the game will be a lot more simple to follow.
Let's just assume it's language that this ancient, this far off humanity had established.
Okay.
And then send forward through space faster than the colonizers can move.
They recognize that it's some kind of knowledge.
Do they understand what kind of knowledge?
What's interesting here is that there's no knowledge in the structure.
Or within a dot X, they're actually just energy.
No, that's not the point.
There's no matter the storage, they're, okay, that's it.
So, if they see the symbols, do they have a correlation to the symbols at all?
They're emotions, they're expressions, they're their effects.
Do they know what symbols stand for?
They have, I'd say they haven't fully understood it.
Yeah, they have a vague understanding of it.
Okay, that's going to kind of affect how the NPCs interact with them.
Like, the more complex one is difficult to parse.
Because the public can explain using the language like, okay.
I'm using these three symbols to make the effect or the dot X, the full symbol of jealousy, for example.
So, we're just going to follow if I'm going to get as they understand that.
They have a vague understanding of it, correct?
Yeah, a little bit of understanding.
And so it's the player, but the player can use written language to also interact.
Then it's not just those dot X, it's both.
You're like, I wouldn't say children, but they're generally curious about the world.
And the player should speak to it in interest.
So, I think, imagine if you have, you can encourage them to, if you have interactions with them.
Sometimes it's social, sometimes it's scientific, sometimes it's felt sensible.
If you consider socialization as a means of interaction, I think most people are compelled to socialize, regardless.
So, these are science, art, philosophy, and then you've got an interest in the game.
Just be careful with the density of information.

Not socializer, is that also carries connotations to some degree? Socialists, socially, so you
want to say, conversationalist, con, also again, conversationalist, scientist. No conversationalist,
artist, philosopher, scientist. That is what we all are, to some degree or another. There
are experts in a given field, but then there are laymen, and laymen is in this silly
end, a negative turn. I am scientifically literate, but it wouldn't call myself an expert.
I strive for the best possible knowledge, the best possible explanation for the things. Science,
art, philosophy, and conversation are the means that which I use to explore the world
and understand it, make sense of it, and I think that is an aspect of missing in games,
where we lack the systems and mechanics necessary to explore dialogue in an interesting way,
and I think I can correct that. We don't have to be so focused on what guns are easy, shooting
easy. What's hard, conversations are hard. Conversations are tough to make. It's in
terms of games. Conversations are easy in real life, but the act of clicking and then
shooting is that it's immediate action. It's easy for players to do the action of jumping
or shooting, or grappling or climbing. Climbing is still in there, and some actions are
in there too, but shooting is not necessarily in there. It's rare. For example, you're shooting
a harpoon and climbing a harpoon. You wouldn't be doing that, obviously, but you can climb
ziplines, maybe. Jeez, tired, ideas, or ants. I'm so glad I've got a quarter, but this


# REC011.txt
again because I've had a hard time sitting through these.


# REC012.txt
Conversationalist, Converser, Converse, Philosophizer, Philosophize, Philosophy, Art,
Artists, Arts, Science, Scientist, Science-ing, researching.
Well, English language is really sucks.
Maybe there's an ING for science.
Science-ing is a word, but it's not, so it will be a word, science-ing.
It should be where I am science-ing.
I am, I am philosophizing. I am art, art, art, art, art-sing, art, art-sing.
Oh, God, that's not a word, either. Socializing, socializing, and philosophizing.
Arts-ing, Science-ing, art, no.
Conversation, art, philosophy, science.
Conversations, conversations, philosophies, arts, sciences.


# REC013.txt
There is a layer of communication not being expressed by the 3D map.
I need symbols to represent interact points, symbols for climbing, symbols for walking, symbols for talking, and symbols for relaxing.
There is a layer of communication not being expressed by the 3D map.


# REC014.txt
Okay, so you want to represent three types of spaces in the immediate area.
I have the collaborative space, the gathering space, I would say.
Imagine a space for you to give you a center.
You don't work towards me to the center, community center.
But for now I imagine the living areas.
Within these living areas there are specialty areas.
The specialty areas are representative of what they need.
So you have the
Therapist's office, for example.
The second floor of this building and the floor of the building is her home.
Or the immediate area of her compatriots, her allies, her friends, her colleagues, her team.
And this is the Aresize team.
So that there are other people in the workshop, really, around the space, where there work.
Aresize them in their own.
Imagine you can not explain it directly, but imagine that she had a grandmother.
A great grandmother, a great grandmother, that's a caregiver.
Great, great, great.
How many grades? How many generations?
Anyway, this is the same as a caregiver.
On the left side of the street you have a family home, immediately.
The largest larger structure, that's a little more...
It's...
The family home is two-story, three-story.
And then the office space is like six-story.
But it's not as...
It's not as wide, it's a little more...
Vertical, so.
Gotta describe that better.
It's not as much the larger in surface area, it's more of a...
There are around the same surface area, it's just a divided differently.
Are you careful this one will let it larger?
I don't know.
It depends.
I am so tired.
Back of it.


# REC015.txt
So you need to define the types of structures for interaction.
So imagine climbing, you have pipes, yeah, that's still a more grounded than vines.
Use pipes to climb whatever.
They're very obviously, they stick out above the vines.
It's just a clear visual image, where you use vines in and of the cells, but it's more like
you get to distinguish them by color, like red, for example.
Start card dressed.
And then you have the most of us.
Maybe a railing needs to jump onto, maybe springboard areas.
In my springboard I mean like parkour or jumping.
You interact here and your character will say a little quick about animation in the third person.
If you get some up to the next area, it's like your interact jump up.
Or climb to the next section, but that ability isn't locked until they've navigated his space with their feet.
So to speak.
So the more complex interactions are not likely at our time.
Literally over time, but as the player gets more and more of the body, I've helped them.
So imagine they have, they can walk right at first, like Bastion.
They can talk a little bit.
Talking gets more complex.
Body gets more complex.
And the body getting more complex isn't an immediate process.
It's not just you go right to the edict form.
Edict being the, no no, it was the...
Oh geez.
They've had an awesome name for it.
It's down in the edict.
The archive.
Hey Google, what time is it?

So you're trying to define it in an innocence of say
Either what is it the technocracy or democracy? What are you trying to define here?
What kind of category?
How do you distribute the power to the leadership?
What makes the leadership different than in everyday citizen when it comes to a choice?
How does the people...
They are...
They are the leadership.
They are most vocal within their media group.
That doesn't decide a leader because...
It decides a leader within a small space.
And it's a small space.
I'm not asking about the small space.
It's a small space.
It's a large enough.
It's a...
So if you do that...
Can we just...
Can we just step back to this?
Just come back a little later.
And this is really frustrating for me.
I'm trying to...
So if you do...
Who's the loudest and the population of 20 billion?
You're going to have over 1 billion leaders.
That's fine.
This is a...
You're going to have the 50 billion.
30 billion, 36 billion.
But it's...
It's...
It's cooperative communication.
It's not...
It's not...
Okay.
I don't know them so it's in red tape.
I'm trying to figure out...
No, this is close.
It's close.
No, because they've owned resources.
No, they've owned...
It's not about social things or anything like that.
So you keep going to roads.
What the fuck does roads have to do with the power base?
It turns...
It turns the expansion.
The expansion of the cities.
And the...
Because you have your fish with space.
You have to bring people close together.
And being bring people close together.
What does that decide if they're run by...
Like a congressional asylum or a senator asylum?
Because traditional politicians don't exist.
I'm not saying a politician.
I'm trying to give you examples of how power is distributed.
And what you keep telling me is they collaborate.
They collaborate like humans.
They collaborate so much.
I'll show you people.
So...
Okay.
Divine hell.
What is hell in this context?
Is it groups of people?
Is it a Singapore?
Is it machines and people?
It is...
People?
They have machines...
No, they have machines working to fix the space.
You can...
I can give you a ratio.
Okay, I don't need...
Okay, let's say there's three main characters.
If you want to build more characters, we can just say...
They're not characters.
I just need to know the power distribution system.
36.
I don't think you're taking a scale into it.
Okay, okay.
If you have 21.
No, hang on.
So if you have a city scattered across this massive or effect,
which means you have a population of like 20 to 35 billion,
how is it doing to six people?
We're going to manage all that.
Hey, Google.
What is the radius of a...
one inch circle?
According to Wikipedia, in classical geometry,
radius of a circle or sphere is any of the line segments
from its center to its perimeter,
and in modern usage.
Hey, Google.
What is the radius of 100,000 kilometers?
That's 500,000 kilometers.
So you have 500,000 kilometers,
and divide that by...
You're trying to find the optimal space.
Let's say...
Let's say there's 300,000 of them.
Or...
Or I'm trying to find a good number for this.
They really describe that scale.
300,000...
150,000...
What does that have to do with power distribution?
There are 150,000 potential,
or major leads like you're requesting.
150,000.
For this scenario.
To manage all that.
Look, how do you divide the power?
There's 150,000 people.
How do they decide the hierarchy?
They divide it by...
I can't take proper skin.
So...
I'll try to describe it.
They define the hierarchy.
So that's what I mean is...
You're not describing anything.
You're not telling me a word.
You've got a ban of words from my people.
I'm like, if I'm going to better describe this stuff.
So that's the issue.
You can tell me what you want,
but you don't describe how you get the...
You tell me collaboration is based on how...
Is that peaceful?
And I've got to make a point to ask how earlier,
because that was...
I think helpful.
Well, so here's what I was trying to explain.
There were a monarchy's constitutional governance,
democracies, dictatorships,
distribution of authority, federal systems,
and you know, unitary systems.
So we had to define a new one.
But that's...
Okay.
Those things we can learn from.
That's what I was trying to get you to figure the fuck out
when you were giving me detail.
I got you.
So I asked you a question.
Okay, so...
What is...
Another good one to pull from.
So we have to ask...
Technology and what else?
It doesn't matter.
It just makes your own...
You don't need to use a real-world system for everything.
Okay, what is...
What is that machine called?
The...
What do the fuck they want?
Model...
Model...
Whatever.
I'll come off later.
I'll look it up.
So...
Why do you keep getting caught up in this?
You keep trying to inspire meanings to words.
I'm not doing it.
All I'm saying is a simple question.
That's what I'm thinking about.
And then you run off and say that I'm advocating dictatorship.
You're right.
And I think...
As the...
As the symbols I tried to describe,
I simple tried to use.
Those...
Those remove...
Emotion...
They move...
They move...
A verbal context from the words, from the expressions.
You...
Okay, so what does this have to do with us trying to figure out the power system?
I...
You're hopping.
You need to tell me when...
I am being over-descriptive.
Well, I kind of want to...
There's just...
But also...
So I need...
To say...
The problem is you get descriptive about the wrong things.
Same move.
And you...
Move.
The question is wrong.
Stop.
You get that is...
I'll ask you...
What's up?
And then you say...
Collaboration.
But you don't explain it.
You're wrong.
Detail.
You don't...
But you don't describe the style of collaboration.
I'm going to break down things.
I'm not going to describe it now.
Because we just spent 40 minutes trying to...
So I could get you to figure out when I say...
Well, how they break it down?
I mean...
The style.
Yeah.
I think that's right.
So your biggest issue is...
You want to explain.
You're rushing.
Now you don't...
You don't explain too much.
You just...
You rush with what you think.
I mean, it was what I actually did.
If I could bottle those extra ideas off...
And I'm like a canister I would.
But I can't.
So I got to speak them out loud.
No, but...
I mean...
That's what I had.
I had to speak them though.
But...
I know it's a bitch.
Trust me.
There's a lot of shame trying to save people.
But it's a habit.
You have to go on.
You need to dig further.
You need to embrace some tangents.
You need to embrace some tangents.
You need to embrace some tangents.
You need to focus on vocal.
You don't need to focus on vocal.
Yes, today we spent five hours and made a room.
Right.
You're right.
Okay, so let's...
That's what I'm going to use to do.
This is a little bit of binders on you.
Because you try to explain everything at once.
I need you to focus on the simple section.
So this is the...
This is the tangent one.
Of course, I care.
No, we're not even there.
We're on outside.
No, no, we were talking about this here.
But over there we got...
Over there we got to talk about characters.
Can't do anything else.
No.
So...
We'll figure it out.
We'll find out.
The whole reason we're coming over is...
We're going to talk about these characters.
We're going to talk about their race.
Okay.
You're giving me a set of characters.
We're all giving me its necks.
And some personality chase.
That's more...
There's more to that the next, of course.
Right.
You...
You said it right.
So I was in like...
A distinction between...
We were bringing the melon levels and the...
No, because they're not human.
No, humans, but humans don't live down here.
But they also don't reproduce.
They're an archiving of the...
Of the...
Of the hypothetically.
Right.
They've been using...
Okay, so...
Keep it down.
Okay, so...
Keep it down.
I hope we're explaining this in a specific context, believe me.
So...
Because they've lived so long...
There's not as much...
And they drift.
Okay.
But...
But it doesn't...
The finest part is...
Attributes when you're talking like...
But you're braving...
It does because you're using this for an egg to drain out random attributes.
And then you're pulling the two bad stuff.
So...
So...
Detrimental...
So, here's the addition.
Here's what I'm trying to explain.
You have a population of...
I know the billion.
But when this player walks through this wall, they need to see people.
But all you define is about seven.
Yeah, that's why I think we need to step back again.
You know, this first, before actually...
So...
How do we describe them?
When will you've given me his names and a set of attributes for each one?
Well, that's when you need to dig into it.
Well, that's what I'm trying to get you to do.
And he's telling me...
Because it's...
Because we keep going into large.
I want to...
I just don't know it.
So you know what they experience.
I know what they are.
Well, then I ever explain it again.
And...
So what I'm trying to get you to understand...
And then pause, pause, pause.
Is...
If...


# REC002 (1).txt
How is it going to affect the player or the story that the player is going to hear?
It's a really good question, but imagine their perspective.
Right now, as far as...
It's timeless though, it's an AEI.
No, the player is timeless.
Humans are almost timeless too.
It's not like the extreme.
You might imagine, because we're not there yet.
200,000 years, 300,000 years.
That's not the average.
That's not the median or the...
Okay, but...
Let's reload that.
Anyway, so...
Right now, as we see the...
The galaxy in the universe.
We're expanding and...
It's affecting right now.
This comes to philosophy.
Let me just...
I'm trying to...
I'll check your philosophy here.
The feeling.
The personable reaction.
Your expression.
My...
I suppose.
I'm just trying to get the relevant.
So you keep telling me you're going to explain it?
I will, but...
Because you...
Right, hang on.


# REC002.txt
We want to know what motivated them, what formed them, what experiences they have going through this hole.
And in order to do that, we need to know what the water is because all you literally have for this water is this room.
This is all you can fill out of a 20 billion populated water is the room.
So now we need to figure out what have they experienced outside of this room.
Because you keep running it like the player is going to have to hear this, he doesn't, but we need to so we know how to build them.
So we'll talk about that.
Because like scientists, that's not a descriptor, that's an attribute.
Let me not say occupation.
Okay, so the main occupation is this room? Can I talk about that real quick?
So what I'm thinking here is how this is going to go.
The main occupation is this would be engineer, artist, you're creative.
Okay, so why is this room in the dark?
Because I'm trying to make sure it's in a picture of the general population what they do for a living.
If you already told me that they were ordered, it's a second test and all that.
Artists, scientists, philosophers, and we spent three hours talking about this yesterday.
So I know what the makeup is, we just have to build the rest of the world now.
Okay, let's suck it.
You tell him what they do, but...


# REC003 (1).txt
Okay, so we believe we know at the present that the universe dies and it will, for all
intents and purposes, but our death of the universe, the belief death, the proposed death,
is much further away from the reality than we expected.
So if we were to say, we believe the universe is getting further away, but they're really
in a procession of motion and we can catch them again, like catching a Mars on an optimal
directory.
So it's like, because we only see a small fraction of time, we haven't been able to comprehend
the fact that this section of the galaxy is invisible yet, because the light has reached
us.
There's a limit in the light.
So you're explaining all the stuff and you're not explaining the reality.
The big thing is the thing that happened, we're trying to understand it.
So like I said, you're explaining all the stuff, but you haven't explained the relevant,
so you keep just explaining more science.
I keep explaining more science.
Okay, so you're right.
You're right.
I have to check a little bit.


# REC003.txt
When you think of Neo-Grasseid, he's a regular scientist, but there are certain subjects
that if you talk to him, people will take his word over so that I might be better knowledgeable
on that subject, but because they know Neo-Grasseid's and the worst is random scientists,
they go over Neo-Grasseid.
So how do you encourage?
How would you?
You don't encourage?
You don't encourage?
It actually happens.
No.
It's literally just us talking and then say, we break off, but we miss him for a period
of quarter of the conversation.
Let's say we talk to him about black holes.
Let's say for this conversation, he doesn't know what a black hole, how it works, but
I say he knows black hole is amazing and then you go, you look up what he thinks of
black holes and you go, okay, and then you read data that is correct.
You might be in not a single district audit, but you might not hold it up as high as what
he's saying.
Because that person is a higher status.
Exactly.
No matter how you run a society, this happens.
It just happens.
Yeah, well it's not even intentional, it's just how people walk, social species and
social reality leads to understanding.
We're a little more competitive than we like to admit.
We're not just that, misunderstanding, that's all it is, and misunderstanding is one
that is right.
We should blew up, because we're so social, but no one wants to take the time to verify.
Everyone wants to be the one that found that scoop.
Think of Facebook, how often do we see a news article pop up for months at a time?
It's the same article.
I already know it's fake, but there are people there if you look at the comments, it's
truly believable.
Damn it.
Damn it.
Okay, so I haven't made books.
Yeah.
And you've been really rooting out like that.
Didn't mean to.
Trying to get further back.
So like, how do we define this system?
Because that's going to be topics you have to cover, things like that.
How do you, how do you define it?
Well, we're not trying to do it differently, we're trying to let it figure out.
Better analogies and technology, better understanding than technology.
So let's put that on the back pocket for now.
Okay.
What I'm more worried about is the cultural makeup with the people.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Wonderful.
All right.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Nice to see.
Sure.
So I'm just like that.
What am I talking about differently?
Quick abbreviation.
Okay.
Okay.
Can you break these down further?
It makes the back a bit bigger.
Okay. One of these.
I'm going to put a lot of work on this.
I'm just trying to figure out what's going on.
Okay.
We can refine it later after we get throughout.
Fine.
Could I pass it here?
What's up?
Um, feel of anger and anxiety.
But why is that taboo?
Why is the taboo to feel that?
Feeling of. No, the feeling of.
It's not.
You just read that they have a taboo, a feeling of taboo.
Imagine this being the word itself.
It's attacking accurate.
You know the word.
Feeling of taboo.
That is you feeling your.
There is what it's called shame.
Or.
I'm worried about the feelings.
We're trying to figure out what would make them feel that.
Just mention that for me.
Okay.
So what do I want you to do this?
You can leave it up.
Feeling it. Okay. Taboo.
Just put it there.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.


# REC004.txt
Can we list positive social aspects?
For other societies, yes, but not for yours. I don't know who you are.
Well, let's just give you an example.
Give me some examples of a positive culture.
Culture is good.
Because we get so caught in the bad for you.
I don't think it's stuff.
So...
Why, who's caught up in the bad?
Not people, society.
Not you necessarily.
Okay, but I haven't listened to anything but we're trying to list positive.
But you went to the pissing the streets.
That was...
Because that's an extreme example that I know you can get.
Okay, something simple.
Just...
Empathetically saying,
Could you give me some examples?
For what? A regular society or your society?
That's what you're losing to me.
Of...of normal society.
Of today's society.
It's socially...
It's socially positive to do people when you walk by.
You don't just ignore them when you walk by us.
That's your one.
Okay, so...
Greetings.
Are you recording?
No, see, I think...
But no...
No, greetings are social.
You're running.
Greetings are...
You're running.
Give me an example.
Give me an example.
So, all I said was greetings.
Give me an example.
That means we're at greetings then.
Yeah.
Greetings.
You want to pause on all these greetings then?
And you don't need to hear.
Why was it all right then?
Okay, well you're not going to fail all that on that stick, you know?
Then we have to list that little thing still.
Well, I was talking about greetings now.
All right.
Just for my mental note.
Let me just do a mental note.
You don't need to write it.
Why I want to want to know.
And then you're misunderstanding my mental notes.
Okay.
Greetings.
Okay, so now that you know this one,
and you know what...
Why don't you really do that?
They would find...
See, this is what I'm struggling to figure out.
How are you struggling to figure out what socially acceptable you are?
I wanted to find out from your perspective on what I wanted,
because I think you have a better grasp over it.
I can try to define it right now, but I'm thinking too rapidly.
I'm thinking too abstractly.
You can break it down in a more narrative sense.
It's not even...
No, see, you're getting so comfortable.
I have...
Okay, imagine.
I have an appreciated norm,
a norm that's been transposed onto me for social behavior,
but I haven't fully grasped every aspect in a verbiage sense.
I have only grasped it in a social way.
So...
That's what you've got on there.
This is...
I need the word of long...
Long day.
I need the words.
Give me the words.
How can you not describe what's good to your own self?
I'm not.
So you're telling me to find and focus on the good,
but you can't even come up with one good thing.
What is something that society does that you view as a positive?
We're really apt at listing negatives.
Humans are.
But there's a lot of positive.
You haven't given me a positive yet.
I'm not asking you to list the negatives.
I don't.
I don't.
Where is it?
Okay.
Okay.
You can keep throwing words at me,
but it's not going to change the fact you need to answer the question.
Yeah.
Positive.
God, I'm struggling so much.
This is the easiest one out of all of them.
My brain is not turned to this and that's socially apt.
If you know about something socially apt,
it's about what is something that you're a society
views as something that's acceptable for people to do?
Well, it's something that they want to encourage people to do.
So we put empathy down.
Right?
So what else would you want out of that society?
You want them to just be empathetic?
You want them to have other things that are positive things today?
So, like, think like this.
I said greetings because you said they're empathetic.
So greetings, how are you feeling busy?
So what is another positive change for this post-ghostly,
epitopeous society that they were trying to foster them
and so people are empathetic and curiosity?
Okay.
So curiosity down.
Why?
That's all.
Just don't have to bother us.
I don't even know how to make the notes work.
So it's going to work.
So like, I don't think I know how this works.
Yeah, okay.
I like taking notes.
Anyway, it goes on.
Power system.
So my problem is I think we're looking at it too broadly.
So curiosity.
I am.
So what is your society or expectation as you walk down the street?
You're expecting people to leave you alone, right?
You're expecting no one to come up and assault you.
That's what I mean by leaving you alone.
Okay, let me give you your store a quick.
It's something interesting.
Fuck.
Okay.
It's all embarrassing, but it's important to sell.
Because I think this...
Why do you have to tell me this story, though?
Because it's relevant.
Okay, I can give you a example of that.
Just type that example.
I mentioned you have one person walking the street
and encounter two other people.
This one person encounters two, and then there's some weariness
because the group sees the other and the other is...
You're getting way too caught up in the street.
This trust.
It's not even just trust.
This trust and trust.
And you bring people up together and there's...
When you walk down the street, you feel the sense of the trust
when you see someone.
You feel unknowingness.
Well, when you don't feel anything, you just not keep walking.
That's why it's not distressed strictly, speaking.
It's also enmity.
Not enmity.
It's lack of knowing.
It's middle between enmity and empathy.
So you're trying to...
You haven't attributed a feeling to them yet.
But it is making you anxious.
Not...
No.
No, not for everyday people.
For everyday people, they just see someone and they go around.
Well, it depends on the context.
How nervous is this person?
How open are they?
It's not even that.
What else?
So, what if...
So, in the society, what would they foster?
If they want to people to be empathetic and curious,
what are their behaviors?
What behavior, rather than empathy and curiosity?
Um...
Okay, I think you have trapped again.
Another behavior that I'm being encouraged is
taking time to think
being by yourself
but also spending time with others.
You have your...
So you just try to dictate yourself?
You spend time in your mind.
Is all they ask.
Is all...
Nothing asks.
Is spending time in your mind is encouraged through the...
It's a cultural trait.
It's not even a trait.
It's just the massing the meditator.
Oh, okay.
So, what would you...
Is that even...
No, it's not really what they'll do right now.
Okay.
What you will try to do is
imagine the group of these people on the street.
So, think of it like this.
There was an unspoken social project on the outside.
When you go outside, you're not going to go around,
you're going to appreciate going into houses,
testing logs.
You're not going to go into mailbox.
You're going to just go about your way.
Do what you need to do.
Talk to people, street people.
Well, there's like a general unspoken agreement
that we're all going to treat each other this own way,
unless you break that agreement.
So, what is that unspoken agreement that they've all come into?
Because you have to realize the play isn't going to know
about this group.
Unspoken agreement.
The role there is that there is literally no spoken agreement
that they can't communicate with them fully.
You're getting caught up.
The play isn't in this yet.
We're talking about the people on the planet.
Oh, the people.
That's all we're trying to figure out.
It's the people that make up the planet.
There is...
I keep doing that.
Hmm.
Minimum communication.
That's a false analogy, right?
That's a goal.
That's the best.
So, you had a really good one over there.
You talked about your video.
It's acceptable for you.
What would you call that?
Why do you mean?
What would you call that in the social context?
That is insecurity.
That is...
But that's not a positive.
Insecurity is a positive thing.
Oh, you know what?
The insecurity is tied to shame.
Okay, so you're running back to the Nordic.
That's not true.
I know.
But what is security?
What is security is pride?
No.
You're pridefully...
No, it's not pride, literally speaking.
It's...
It's you are...
elated by...
The physical...
The physical feeling of your body.
You're good.
You feel good.
Okay, then that's not security.
The security is...
Well, we can't use...
We can't use the word with your dot X.
Because this is all I can...
But this isn't...
Oh, you don't want to use a dot X for...
When we're trying to just describe the society to ourselves.
Okay, fair enough.
I'm not going to say it on a chance like this,
because you want it already in dot X.
That's true.
Okay.
So what is a positive societal trait that these people would have?
They have get together rings.
They have get together rings.
Get together rings?
What is the other thing that happens?
That's not a trait.
I need to behave here, so...
To find behavior in a multi-faceted system.
One person to pounding people talked about.
So...
Look at this.
When you walk down the street, right?
Two people interacting.
Is that behavior to you in this context?
Don't we...
You getting caught up on the stupid little details.
It doesn't matter that people, if those people are not,
this is how you conduct yourself.
This is what is the structure that you use to conduct yourself.
It's all trying to figure out.
So you're trying to figure out what is positive behavior that they would teach these people to conduct themselves.
A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a.
A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a.
A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a.
Why is it so hard to guess?
Like...
Would...
Would...
Would Nelson...
Would schooling be a viable topic for this...this tangent?
Because that comes in play.
Do I the race how they interact?
That's not us. It's important though to develop their development, so
That's not what we're trying to figure out. I get it's important that they develop it
What I'm asking you is what is the positive? What is the expectation of society when you are out doing about
What are some of the positive things that they expect you to conduct yourself with?
I
Need an example
I'm trying to imagine them again, but it's really difficult
so
In agend
Mongolian social society also is Japanese social society
I'm going to decide it is polite quiet typically in pathetic. They agree that they're collective on one's
Mongolian society is brutal honest and they don't really care about
I will opinion on what feelings if they honestly have an issue with it they give you a weapon and you guys
Would solve it with honor through combat
combat
So combat on
Sports
You get into caught up in actions
Says you just keep listening at two these well, I don't know how else to interact
Activities are focused on the interaction
But if the interactions are the interesting player points if I think I
Let's try we're not thinking about that. We're still trying to build people. Okay
You keep trying to build the game trying to build interesting interaction
We're not doing that we're trying to build the social structure of this society
And so for we have listed two positive social traits
I need more
That's why we have time and sticky notes
Simon now you guys I
This is the thing it's always over. You get the progress
This is not something that's going to be
This is going to be a lot of head banging
Why most creative projects fail?
It's this is most clear thinking. It's easy but then when you realize oh, I have to literally come up with every time
You little taboo social piece and social strand that except a cultural
I mean like if you want the half-faceted you could just rush through but you want you said that social
Social connection is the biggest thing this game
So what I'm trying to do then is to help you build hyper realistic characters by building a wall that they grew up in and I want you to try to envision yourself
Experiencing this world so that when you write out your characters or you go to give these voice actors dialogue
You can give them something meaningful think of last of us forces
Call of duty. Oh, hey, yeah, that's good point actually. I think that they know the same game
The characters feel more real if you're more genuine. Yeah, and call of duty
Yeah, because we're not the big difference a call of duty. We know to expect hyper realistic military action
But it ends there
We're last of us they put you
Next to these two people imagine you look at a massive us watching all this action
That's how I want you to think when you're building with sport. You're not in the action with missing it
That's not about it. Oh my god. So how would you if you were watching these people interact about you interacting with them
What are positive traits that you would have seen in the interactions of them? That's what I'm asking
Because if you have been envisioned this people in your head you've envisioned how they interact together
So you said they'll crop it, but we'll cover that after the curiosity
Should we you should we build characters them about what's in there because I think I'm gonna be easier
So you build interpersonal interactions and you build our words to more complex ones
I'm trying to build your character still. Okay, so I'm gonna do the job from the build the character. All we have is or explain right away
so okay
Do you need these things then they do need better to find interaction because right now if you want to build them in your head
It's not even our action. It's just more what the building materials are using the building. Can I give you like a short skit or I can ask it?
I just need you to list personality traits that you view as asked. I need to imagine skits and I give you a example
Okay, how they interact
They have a certain level of distance when it comes to other close
Psychology isn't
Getting going to their office is not a taboo
It's understood. Okay. It's it they are aware of it. They're not
Again, I'm not question what our positive social that is a possible social positive social social traits of ours
It's a social trait of the fact that you're describing
So that's the stigma stigma is the is the trait. We've already like covered an empathy
Well, then empathy is three-go
But we need more than just a single trait to define a society
Because they have a little empathy curiosity and what else?
It's your society
empathy curiosity and
Pride
Would you read that as a social a positive social at the man?
Curiosity
Pride
You need a pencil
You have to try and
Want
So you don't need to cover why I need this basic. Okay, what was it a woman curiosity?
Desire
Why would you list that as well? Not desire curiosity want curiosity. You're actually pride and
What was that one I recorded it but I forgot it
You
Lifted the book and had a list of traits, right? Yeah, that's all trying to figure out
But if they feel for one character will try to figure out for the entire species
Now you finally get it. Okay, so
Imagine building a
Background dodeck for each character to describe what they are
The drivers the man drives this is a question of what you do is positive social
Okay


# REC005.txt
Hi, it's Lauren. Okay, so should I try to articulate it from which character should I
focus on first? I'm not doing the hip, it's a positive social interactions that we
use what the aspect of trying to walk on right now. If I built a donut, I could actually
get freaking out of you. You don't need a donut to list traits. If you want to go to
the donut, go ahead but we do not need it in order to list traits because I know if we
use the donut, you need something to put on it.
It's not even that, I just got it. You just, you think of one thing, and then you hear
a word and say something, you don't know the topic. And then, well, saying that you ran
off topic and then you have had me because I'm still on the first topic. It's like, well,
let's still try to figure out that first one. So, if I were to explain, we are defining it from
this scale, we're not defining it from a global scale. We're not, we're defining it for large
in this, then. How bigger? How big are we? We're defining the entire species. Like that,
bigger? No, you're defining the entire species, so I don't know how I was going to say to you.
The entire species, this is going to decide the entire behavior before the final.
You're not focusing on one care of those behavior, you're describing the species as a whole.
You're getting too caught up in trying to... I can just try the entire species as a whole,
but I can't, I'm not really describing the intricate social spaces. This is an intricate,
we haven't even hit the intricate stage yet. This is... Well, I can try the basic stage.
I can just try the big stuff. Big stuff, I think it's all interesting. But, no, I don't know.
But it's poison to other things. So, we will try to figure out what is the general
personality on the planet. You said they're an episodic species. So, now we need to build a...
So, you want to build these six characters, but in order to build them, I need to know
what interactions they would have likely had growing up and all. Should I find a motivation for
trying to build them? No, yeah, we need to fill this out so we know what the motivation
species is. So, if you're going to build a character, this is going to be like the defining list.
But the traits you're going to be building before that daily character.
We're trying to find the parameters that the species runs on,
what are things they would do, and what are things that they would be negatively.
For example, you said unity is enough for issue, so they may not.
But the unity is an issue, but they might look at it as an issue if you walk up and
push over something else.
So, the power systems are going to pride in
aspiration, pride in aspiration.
And then, have it will be the negative figure?
No, we're going to fill that one. Do you think it's taboo?
Yeah.
We're going to have some diverse things for our enemies.
So, why are you over there?
When we haven't even filled any of them out,
then why are we organizing them?
Because we're probably going to change it after we filled them out.
This is just a rough draft, you know.
We're not able to just be thinking about this,
not wasting time, moving around, and destabilizing this.
But it's important, so here's the essential thing in there.
Here's the negative, here's the negative.
So, you're getting too caught up in that,
and you're just coming up with the factual behavior.
So, you're getting too caught up in how it looks.
Here's taboo, here's aspiration.
Here's your power system, middle between aspiration and pride.
You know, it's right here, this is the, this is the yawner, right?
This is the thing that you, I want you to fill out the damn sticky notes.
Not fuck a phone.
Okay, this is a letter on, you're right.
Like, I mean, you want to organize it, but we need to have someone to organize.
That's right.
It's like, I just, like, I don't want to go into the game,
I feel like I know you so much.
I feel like I know you should see,
I feel like I know you should see.
It's not a joke, knowing, I just, it's just,
Are you so distracted?
No, it's not.


# REC006.txt
I don't know, he's in trouble, I know Chris will talk to him himself out eventually, so I just let him do that.
He's like a dog at least, he's like keep running, eventually he gets tired on the leash, he just wants to sit.
Because it went like this yesterday, we started off rough, but it took us about an hour, hour and a half before we finally got you in the systems that we needed to.
But I think next time let's just bring this up instead, you know?
Just right away, now we're going to...
I mean, what I'm trying to do is, so yesterday, even me build a lot of it, I'm trying to get you to build more of it.
Because like yesterday I'll give a suggestion and you just go, okay.
And I don't want you to build your game like that, I want this to be your game, so I want you to control the narrative.
Well I like you doing characters.
What are you doing characters right now?
What are we doing?
That's why I...
Social media trying to provide ideas for my brain.
Because my ideas are from a different mindset.
You're of character ideas, you're of interactions, you're of interest in social places.
Yeah, I like...
I know how to play narratives when it's in a small group.
But I need you to define the small group that I'm going to be walking with.
We're going to be like companions.
You...
When you do positive things with one of the companions, they go, yeah.
This is when you do negative things, they go, why do you do that man?
We were trying to figure out those behaviors for the society.
What are the behaviors that are going to be like, yeah, that was good.
And what are the behaviors that if you did that, but...
Well, I hate to say that again, but we could use a Dodec for shunhand.
Okay, but we don't have enough to fill out a Dodec.
Well imagine, we do, we are tall, I am.
But we're trying to build...
Imagine throwing a dice to kind of...
Okay, that's not a storytelling, that is laziness.
That is laziness, right?
Well, you're imagining manually twisting a dice.
So...
I wouldn't want to do something physical.
Well, the character building isn't a physical process.
It is a very loose process.
But for me, it's a shunhand that I can use to communicate to you.
Okay, but we need to figure out some general.
We need to figure out the outline I can play in.
We'll be the best way to define it.
I need to know what are the things they would do, what are the things they wouldn't do.
Think of all the questions I asked just for that one scientist.
This is like that, but on a scale, we're trying to build a wall.
We have like a billion questions to answer.
So I need to know...
By you filling this out, this gives me a list of questions that I can just immediately throw away and refine.
Because if I know the empathetic, I'm not going to ask all the crew.
I'm not going to ask due they're social, because the empathetic, they don't.
So by filling this out, this gives me ways to refine my questions.
And hopefully it takes us from a billion down to millions.
And then the next time we do another draft, it takes us down to thousands.
I'm not trying to figure everything out now.
I'm just trying to get rid of some of this shit I don't have to ask.
Fair enough.
Right, because there's a lot of words to parse, a lot of information to parse.
Yeah, we're trying to build a society.
And I'm going to show that society from eight people.
I'm being too...
I'm being too destructive of these things.
I'm being too...
I'm breaking down too much.
Let me do like this.
I need a macro breakdown.
And you're doing a micro breakdown.
That's your point.
And then I like the macro macro, but then I get the large large scale too.
But I can't do this.
So the issue is we need some way in which we met, though.
Yeah, you're trying.
I'm trying to get you to move both your goalposts.
I'm coming closer to the world building in the space.
And you're coming closer to the world building and the characters.
And we're going to meet in the middle of...
Because some of you need a small scale today.
And yet, but for the rest of you, you need a small scale.
And I get...
Can I try?
What if I drove the space in your day using my concerto I showed her?
And then I give you the space.
And we can work together to melt the spaces.
You can...
But I want any development here.
So I think it's going to be a dialogue.
There's a few myths in this.
I don't know what it is.
It's pretty like a community board.
It's not going to be a community board for the space you can't take it.
Okay, but you're already way ahead of what we're at.
So that's what I want to do.
I really want to build these characters.
But if I'm going to build them directly, I need to have...
Thing like D&D, they give you a set of rules to pull from from each character.
You don't get the pull and you trade for any character.
Each character has a limit of rules.
I am trying to define that limit of rules right now.
Because if I know what to pull from, then we can start figuring out the...
Social makeup, the society of how many is engineering, how many are scientists.
And then when we figure that out, I can go...
Okay, I'll walk on the scientist.
And then we can pause out them.
But to get to that stage, I have to build the system I'm going to use to pause it out with.
Give me the adjacent...
Okay, so okay.
Describe to me a Warhammer story.
Your short story.
And then give you adjacent philosophy.
Did that represent?
Okay, so Warhammer isn't...
That doesn't look for Warhammer.
Warhammer is set in a Grimdalk setting.
I know.
Okay, so Dino Grimdalk is...
There's one thing I need to do.
Have you heard of Grimdalk though?
Grimdark.
So you won't want to pause it.
This is the society of Warhammer.
It is a civilization whose leader has been crippled.
So they have went from the Naseculo society...
...to being a corrupt, overloaded, baroquecy,
where they're constantly killing each other for no reason.
That's the Imperium, and they're fighting a demonic threat that feeds off of that negative emotion.
So they're so and more and more chaos.
And then they're fighting another race of species that are trying to kill everyone just because they can.
And it's like, there's no good guy.
Oh, can I give you like a fun little spoiler from that?
And that's fun.
Mine is fun.
A discreable spoiler that I had.
I don't care.
From the recent Godzilla anime, on Netflix.
Oh, I don't know what you see in all of them.
Oh yeah.
Okay, so the last episode is like...
...in order for Godzilla to stop attacking us,
where you just stop advancing in technology and destroy ourselves...
...and bring our bring ourselves back to the...
...the basic age.
And forever say that it's a basic age.
Yeah.
But in reality, it's more like, no, we can...
So that's with the technology, isn't it?
It's like imagine you're blending with Godzilla.
So you just described Suffy as long as him.
Huh?
Suffy as long as you're...
No, the trend.
It is, they want to go back to the time of Muhammad.
They believe Muhammad left, led the most prune...
Beautiful life to get to all of them.
That's what that is.
That's what the Godzilla reference is.
No, that's what...
That's what the referencing is.
That's the trend.
No, they want to go step back.
They want to get rid of every technology.
They do anything made up of the time of Muhammad.
This is taking...
This is step above that.
This is optimistic.
No, I know.
I know.
We're with technology and we're melding with it.
We're embracing technology and nature as one.
Okay.
Okay.
But again, we need social traits.
So, thinking about this, he just listed two races.
Because he said Godzilla.
They were the priest race and the normal people.
Well done.
And the Godzilla is...
There is no Godzilla.
There is no animal attacking the world they're destroying the world.
It's just...
No, no, I'm talking Godzilla's nature.
You're getting caught up again.
You're getting caught up in everything again.
We're not talking metaphors.
We're talking the characters in that series.
Oh.
There was two races.
There were the normal humans and then there was the alien one.
That was helping up.
Right?
Yeah.
The humans that were looking behind.
Okay.
The thick of the social stride of the humans left behind.
They look to those aliens as priest, right?
In a way.
But they look more like tribes people.
Well, yeah.
I don't really see that enough.
I know, but see you're getting caught up again.
Yeah, okay.
Tribe priest.
Go priest.
So, you wouldn't go up to a priest and you wouldn't spill something on him.
You wouldn't go up to a priest and you...
Think about this.
When you go around a religious trigger, you tend to watch a language.
Even if you don't believe, it's the sign of unspoken respect.
He didn't ask you not to cause.
You just kind of kicked it in gear automatically.
We're trying to figure out what are the tribals for them like that.
Okay.
So, you've got to ask...
It sounds funny.
You've got to ask those triggers.
You've got to find out what would incite...
Insightings.
Well, that's why we have the negative side, too.
But first, we've got to figure out positive aspects.
Okay.
Imagine that they're being incites, points of conflict, and the range of conflict.
So, you've caught up in explaining.
You're not answering questions again.
Okay.
Well, let's say the conflict here is, for example, in another context.
I say the conflict is gender.
Or the conflict is politics.
Or the conflict is, okay.
You mentioned...
Bernie Sanders.
And then, some of them is racing.
They're behind everybody's biases.
They're coming in their head.
You know?
Okay.
See you right now.
Because I'm asking you to answer a question.
And you're just throwing in formation.
Because we still have to figure out a fourth positive trait.
How much do you throw again?
I was fine.
I figured out that you go for a minute.
Because you're bringing up good information as you're doing it.
See, that's why I don't want to stop you.
Because when you do it, you give me stuff like a bounce off of.
Okay.
So...
I'm trying to get you back to what we were.
Let's take a step back.
Okay, imagine, okay.
So religion, politics...
So you're looking at it way too...
No, no.
You think of these as insights.
We're not looking at insights right now.
We're not looking at insights.
Not insights.
No, that's not right.
What I'm asking you to look at is two different social groups.
That's all I'm asking you to look at is...
When you abide so on of your other social group,
you don't outwardly be mean.
There is a level of politeness, I guess we could call it,
for lack of a better term, that most people tend to exhibit.
You're not friendly, but you're not aggressive.
You're more of a neutral stance.
What is that neutral stance for these people when they're exploring the world?
That's what we're trying to figure out.
Is how do they conduct themselves in a public setting?
Because that's what a social positive trait is.
I can describe that space, but I can't describe interactions individually.
I don't need the individual interactions.
I need a general interaction.
Think of it.
We didn't say each one is kind.
We said the empathetic.
Okay.
Let me paint you a picture then of the general space with people there.
So you don't need to paint the space?
No, I mean, that's part of it though.
That's part of the interaction.
The space is...
That's not what we're focusing on.
But it's important to convey it.
I don't need to describe the exact space.
I need to describe the general space, the feeling, the conveyance.
Well, see, you say you're not going to describe the exact.
And I don't want to listen to you for 10 minutes to describe the space.
Well, okay.
I'm going to try to describe it carefully then.
You get three sentences.
Okay, that's fair.
Starting now.
You have the bedroom.
Karma.
Karma.
No, that's...
Karma.
So you get three bullet points.
Let me put it that way.
Bedroom.
Karma.
So that's one.
Karma.
Bedroom.
Bedroom.
And you have a little room.
So...
Okay, so you have that dining room?
I'm going to stop you.
You just...
You have the heart.
You just wasted it.
I'm not going to come back up.
No.
So let me stop you really quick.
You get so caught up in posting out of details that don't matter.
So the thing of this, like, when we talk,
do we talk in the living room and then go to the kitchen to talk,
and then go to the bedroom to talk?
No, we talk in this one room.
I need you to envision a conversation between them.
They're not going to walk around as they're talking.
They're going to...
No, no, no.
I have a girlfriend again.
Um...
Bedroom.
I'm not putting on the text because that's easier.
So anyway, like this,
you want to describe too much of the area.
We don't need all of it yet.
We'll focus.
All we really care about is the interaction.
What are positive things that this group wants and expect from people
who are not so out and about?
We have chosen the expected to be empathetic and curious.
What is something else you would...
you would be asked to do in this society?
Something you'd ask for in this society?
Well, yeah, that's what we're figuring out.
It's like, what are the things that this...
what are the traits that society considers positive
and portray when you will interact with society?
Positive interactions.
Yes, now you're finally getting what those three words mean.
Positive social interaction.
It's something nice.
That society wants and expects when they interact with you.
Okay.
We've already got empathetic and that's why we still...
I agree, it sounds silly, but it's simple.
It's not necessarily about the action.
It's about behavior.
Exactly.
So, smile.
Hi.
We have an under empathy.
So...
You know, okay, under empathy.
You know, we want to keep it vague because you're going to be building characters in these.
These aren't what they are.
These are what you want to pick from.
So, I think of when Lovecraft built his characters.
He didn't give us the whole list of traits that they were.
He slowly flushed them out through how the character interacted.
Like, I would use him for an example, but he's very solo-ish.
There's no big party setting.
So, if they're almost the party's dead by the end of it.
So, we're not going to do rats in the wall,
because I didn't realize you'd get triggered really easily by that word.
And it's trying to...
That word, like, froze your mind every time.
We'd be in with thought.
And thinking daily about it.
And it's like, ah, fuck, that's too far in there.
And then all of a sudden, nevermind.
Oh, God, why?
Exactly.
So, this is you would list the animator.
This is about a dude in military who met someone.
And they...
We were close.
And then he grew afraid of his friend.
Because he realized his friend was batshit and sane.
Chapter 1 from The Dark.
Here's a good example.
You've been playing out of wards, right?
Yeah.
Think of how he...
Think of...
Think of the ball.
Everyone was connecting themselves the same way, right?
People were just kind of there.
They weren't causing the wreckage.
They weren't doing anything positive or negative.
They're just in a neutral stance.
They were just there.
Now, pretend it's not a consequence of the game's design.
It's not giving any behavior.
Because think of, like, when you go to the store or when you go to walk.
You know, people doing things.
But they're not necessarily interacting.
They're just kind of there.
Like, when you go to walk, you know, don't take off your helmet on the floor.
You know, don't throw your shit with everyone.
You know you have a spot you need to go to and be in.
No one tells you that every day, but when you go there, you know the expectation.
That's all they're trying to figure out.
What is society's expectation of the people when they're interacting?
And we've got a good start.
We've got...
We expect them to be empathetic.
They were expected to be curious.
Bastards.
They're fighting back there.
I don't hear anything.
So what else would society expect out of them besides kindness, empathy, and curiosity?
What were some other things that would be expected?
Being introspective.
Okay.
So then let's put it.
Okay.
I've heard what was my friend in college and then after I could only speak with extreme terror.
This terror is not due altogether to the sinister manner of his recent disappearance.
It wasn't gendered by the whole nature of his life.
The first game is a cute form, more than 17 years ago.
When we were in the third year of our course, Mr. Todd University met us from the dark.
While he was with me, the wonder and the diabolism of his experiments fascinated me.
And I was as close as Pat.
Now he is gone and the spell is broken.
The actual fear is greater.
Memories and possibilities are ever more hideous.
The first horrible incident.
I want you to think about that line.
He said the spell is broken.
He didn't mean magic.
So this human voice is described as cold.
For those who left, he's got some kind of charisma to him that attracted this guy.
They made them friends.
And while he was alive, he rationalized everything they did.
It wasn't until after he died that he realized what they did was kind of fucked up.
And after he had got what happened, it was the greatest struggle.
The way he described that was is and then the spell ended.
See, he was able to describe a relationship with just that reference.
What I'm trying to get you to do is to kind of concisely speak out the still points of what do you expect your society or what does society expects.
In the organic machinery of mankind, I calculated the chemical action after the failure of natural processes.
In his experiments were various animating solutions.
He had killed and treated immense numbers of rabbits, insects, cats, dogs, and monkeys.
Till he did become the prime nuisance of the college.
Several times he actually obtained signs of life in animals supposedly dead.
So this figure of the sign is behind this, by the way.
This is magic.
It's a secret for animal life and situation.
What would be the appetite to animals?
What would be a trait?
It would be a little bit too specific.
It would be the empathy to animals.
It's the empathy in general.
So you all just...
Okay, so you've kind of...
So what do you mean?
What do you tend to define it?
Are you species of an empathetic to animals?
That's already covered in empathy.
If an empathetic species in post-scarcity, they have no need for hunting.
Do you plan on the way there?
We can, but we can do that when we're building the characters.
Because I know you want to keep it vague.
Remember, this is the personality before you're going to be drawing on it
when you build the characters later on.
So you don't want specific language.
You want vague umbrellas.
So when you get to the character, you can get more specific.
This is your guideline.
You don't need to be specific here.
You want vague umbrellas.
Try to think umbrellas.
The tones that have a broad meaning...
They're not chasing it.
Okay.
That's what we want with empathetic and curiosity.
We didn't see it in multiple.
Multiple.
It's multiple directs.
What do you mean?
Multiple directs.
Multiple.
You keep going to the dotick.
No, no, no.
Multiple expressions of behavior.
Close.
We're getting that.
What else does it say?
It's multiple expressions of behavior.
Internal behavior.
Actual behavior.
It is...
So you're getting a little bit too...
No, no.
It's the entire culture.
It's meant to be represented even though it's not the level.
It's the general language.
It's important not to figure out the general language.
That's what we don't like so far.
It's like a general language.
It's not everything, but it's...
We can't forget about the directs when we're building this.
We'll just build it on this.
So you keep trying to bring in all of this other influence.
But I'm trying to use the directs to it.
We use the doticks.
That's it.
That's it.
You're skipping subset.
Because we don't even have the force sticking up food in here.
Okay.
So we just...
We just grab the prosthetic.
No, you're good.
No.
Well, that's kind of why I play it.
It helps keep the stuff.
So...
They really like this.
You said that...
They look out for chances.
Right.
They do look out for each other.
And they're pathetically.
Okay.
So we're carrying it here.
We can use that.
Or describe something else.
A million.
And was deepened from future expense.
That's...
It doesn't belong in this.
Yes, of course.
I was thinking...
Well, I thought it was...
No, I was thinking you can get it out of here.
Yeah.
They were like this.
We know they look out for people.
Sometimes they look out for the city, right?
I had always been exceptionally tolerant of Westerners.
So if we know that the security is something we're going to look out for.
The decision.
And we're going to say for what can peed out often?
What i was so close?
Sub both.
My friend believed that artificial rearrangement could depend on our most head fruit.
I mean...
Every night on fire.
So...
One thing.
This was written in 1920.
When they thought we were carrying...
people that were insane by the bottom using electricity.
We didn't know what the fuck, anything was back then, you need to keep that in mind, and what he's describing is a ward controlled by these Jane Guards that already know that they want to pull out his gun.
He's not describing the guards, he's describing this dude is describing his friend worst, who is this weird psychopath that was killing animals and injecting them with chemical compounds.
This wasn't the Guards' story, they don't exist, but instead we have determinism.
This was necromancy.
No, he's talking about necromancy, he's talking about social abortion, he's talking about necromancy.
This guy literally was just trying to kill stuff to bring it back to life.
And this is how his misadventure of becoming friends with this guy, and getting trapped up in this weird social charisma that the guy had over him.
He described it on the book that he felt like the guy had some kind of swig over him, because he gets him to do things he normally wouldn't, and it becomes clear later on on the chapters.
Oh shit, speaking of ghosts, do you know this guy tried to prove ghosts were real?
I can't taste how, can I write down here?
Yeah, but this guy was my favorite on how he tried to prove ghosts were real.


# REC007.txt
And that's what he did.
Okay, real quick video.
I don't think she got back to it though.
It's great though.
No, but anything.
She claimed she saw and made a bunch of money off of it.
Oh, she is.
She claimed she had the freedom of what he spoke to instead I made it.
And when she made a shit ton of money off of this guy's delusion.
Jesus Christ.
But there's nothing I bring on up is because then we can move into negative traits.
Because that shows predator to a sense.
No, it doesn't, right?
What's up?
We have to give them negative traits.
Let's try to come up with the opposite of negative traits.
And negative traits are easier than positive traits.
We have to come up with negatives eventually.
Okay, well, it's true both.
It's too negative.
We can't even come up with a positive.
This lovecraft comes with something negative.
Okay, so let's come up with a positive though.
Okay, well, if we present a negative, we present an alternative positive.
Okay, I need you to do it for this though.
Okay.
The way we showed was not here, buddy.
Come on, you could do it.
We got it this time.
It's fine.
We've only spent two hours on it.
And so now this didn't help.
I got everything else just fine, but this is hard.
I don't know why.
Because it's not a big thing, thanks.
Which is why I'm so technical, and so introverted.
And I don't socialize enough.
I haven't exercised a social aspect by bringing that.
Social enough?
I'm not social with a reason.
I understand those aspects, but I don't really know.
But is this...
Well, thanks.
May I go with you again?
No.
You can easily go with me and you.
I just need to know this thing though.
It's so great, then.
Go ahead.
I feel like the exact will be hidden in the tree.
Okay.
Getting cars in one of the stillness.
We don't even have anything to do yet.
Right after trying to make feel for us.
So right, empathetic and introspective,
so that's the only thing I'm going to do.
Peaceful.
Like you said, there's a non-violence,
so they expect to level with peacefulness,
or EM, being introspective,
personally introspective.
Very good.
Introspective.
What was last year and then was that?
Um...
You hadn't heard of something?
What?
Introspective, empathetic, kind, and curious.
Oh, peaceful.
Peaceful.
Fun in us.
Yeah.
It's all about us there.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, no.
So...
So then...
Let's move on to the other side.
We said that...


# REC008.txt
So the reason why that isn't pulling is because the typical American runs off of the
That's a good idea. Don't have coordination
Ah! That's...
There is a thing built on the argue set distinction
Just listing what you expect out of it.
So we'll use Technocracy for that,
because we don't have a little toy.
We'll write pH next to it, so we know it's a place we want to go.
I want to be a team.
Technocracy with an asterisk.
Oh, it's the maximum, but with Technocracy with them.
So it's Techno, G, N, C, H, O.
Oh, I know Techno.
Techno.
Oh, crap.
Is there a combination of Technocracy?
Is Technocracy a synonym for the software?
Is it a built-off of Technocracy?
No, it's its own thing, but I used it to describe it,
because it's spelled the same way.
Is it a line on the Microsoft?
No, I was trying to get you to spell this paragraph,
so that's why I said democracy.
Gotcha.
It wasn't a comparison, it was.
They just ended the same policy,
so I'll try to show you how this felt about having this felt about it.
Oh, okay.
Social interest.
What is this one, mundane?
Well, it's like a mundane thing with it.
It's got your notes.
Scratch.
I think it's a really good thing.
Because not everything I do is interesting.
It's really good for the software.
It's really just what are they doing when they're not on the set?
Well, what are they doing when they're not working on it?
We're talking about social interest,
and we're checking what are they doing on that free time.
It's not going to be interesting,
but it's something you have to figure out.
Okay, no.
That's not a better script right there.
I'm not making a center.
Science.
Art.
Science, Art, Philosophy, and Conversationality.
Yeah, Social Interest.
Science, Art, Philosophy, Science, Art, Philosophy, and Conversationality.
It's as highly regarded as being the attitude for conversation.
It's just as highly regarded as science, Art, and Philosophy.
Yeah, it's part of medicine, it's part of communication, it's part of...
I think that...
Let's say instead of mythological, I'm going to pronounce you here.
Because that's a good reference.
Let's say it's...
It's hypothetical, or it's theoretical, or it's...
Why would we call it theoretical?
Not theoretical, it's...
So, do you know the list of...
No.
I mean, in terms of science.
I mean, what do they...
How do you mention it?
It's obviously a structure.
They mythological, they mythological, they mythologicalize it, but they know it's real.
They know it's real.
They know it's a thing made by beings.
It's not...
So, in order for your society to walk, we need to have people that they view...
Think of like Congress, the founding houses.
They each had a person that...
House can look at it and on.
What I'm bringing is...
You said that they're not democracy, but it's not democracy.
It's just that buildings that are those specials for each field represented.
Mhm...
Not...
There are...
Higher specials...
There are specials that are highly, highly, highly regarded.
One or another, they don't learn things, but they look too.
Yeah, they look too.
But if you're trying to define figures that...
Well, they represent,
We're trying to define like根u Newtogrest, I understand.
They say, let's say this social interest, right?
Let's just add that to사4.
And they're built out of...
This is not the...
It's not really the same.
This is these four systems, and they're built together in their own.
So what does this have to do with the Soviet?
Four political groups, instead of two.
Almost none of them have a number of political groups.
Yeah, but it's not political, it's just that...
It's the fact that you gain confidence again.
It's the largest number of groups.
What do you ask me about a methodological group?
And now you're at talking to the extended checks.
Let me explain.


# REC009.txt
things is not like those I mean kind of mystic meaning to I just mean think of like Jim Bowies
think of like Mormon legends of people think of Einstein with Tesla those like a truth to them
but then over the years each decade that's passed since the death that the kind of mythology
used to appear to Andrea the scientist.
Could we say instead of this?
I think both aspects I think you're just too caught up on words at this point.
No mythological influences.
What did I have there?
You have figures.
Why? Because we're talking about people. Those are figures.
We don't know the good but yeah we're trying to find the creator right?
So why are you getting yourself head up on one word though?
Because this explains the better.
I'm trying to consider it at bees.
These figures are called a force in mind.
I'm a scientist.
Okay but once upon a time I can see you getting stuck in the script when you get it.
But that's how you have to know if there's something.
This isn't important to anything.
There's no reason.
None of this is important.
Okay, backing up, backing up, backing up.


# REC010.txt
There's people that believe in books that have been mythologized over time.
You keep trying to tell me what I'm saying.
When I'm not saying anything about that single book.
Did he be running with these words for an attempt?
It wasn't there last year.
It was there when I lost it.
What do you guys think of it as saying like this one?
I hadn't intend to hit it at all.
One thing was, you just move forward and you can lift it up.
Imagine on a spectrum.
On a spectrum of human interest.
So I don't trust.
There is the rigid.
And then the metaphorical artistic.
And then there's the mundane.
It's not the physical figures.
It's the artistic.
It's not the scientific per se.
It's not even autistic.
It's a social thing.
It happens with figures.
People that are highly goal-driven,
but what's it cause?
It's overall interest.
Overall curiosity.
Overall.
This is just cheering them.
You're doing so kind of the meaning.
Oh boy.
Backing up, backing up.


# REC011.txt
shale type of figures for these people and because they don't use violence we're using people that
excel in the fields. Now the thing when you have a hiring but repulsing is no matter what
in the end of human telephone they are actually getting masala guys. Like Jim's belly was a back
wasn't it but if you look at him now those stories and legends if him having a knife man out of a
cosmic meter right. It's not like there's anything to it is these are stories. Can you give me something?
Can you give me some character then? We haven't gotten that full. Now let's read Alice for you to find them.
We're not even on that step yet. You're skipping. You said myth of the ice figure.
Myth of the ice figures. I know but we haven't gotten yet. You're still working on the societal structure.
Okay well let's go back to that then. Okay so social structure to me on that
tactic is attack accuracy. It is how deep can I go?
How can I describe it? Okay.
They are of open expression physically and emotionally.
Open expression.
Open expression.
Where is HP left?
was by him being Ray Stassel, as always, but I was in the race and that's what I can do
for him.
Yeah.
Now the dude wasn't stupid, he was really well-loaned.
That's what made it so funny that he just had that one quirk, but he didn't get the
one bad, bad, fucking bird.
So you got your number back then.
Like I said, the general science consensus was there was the white humans and then
it's like a load service species.
So, he reminded me of a section of the effect then that we're empathetic, but it weren't
documented.
Of course there are empathetic people, we're not saying that it wasn't.
I think there are a lot of empathetic people, but they could do so.
So, why are you talking about this?
Because if you think about slavery and it is bad, it's the world we're talking about slavery.
Because I'm trying to distract the community of it.
There's, okay, extreme disease rates and there are not focuss.
And you see the...
So, what does that have to do with it?
I'm trying to break it in the post together.
If you distract the extremists, distract them.
This is extremely extreme, we don't want to see them.
This is extremely demanding.
You want to...
It is left behind, it's from the 20s.
It is.
But imagine it going further.
Imagine it going further.
The division has culture.
The division has states.
The division has countries.
But that's not going to happen in all that times.
So, let's shut up.
But I'm trying to shut up.
There's no division in that world.
Okay.
I know you described that to someone.
Imagine trying to describe the world.
So, what was the small effect?
What is something I feel that was sent out to you?
You've already explained this to me.
Yeah, I should have seen you talking.
This is a dumb attempt at us.
I don't know what I'm doing this.
And if you were explaining to me again and again.


# REC012.txt
And as Utopian built on, scientific literate sci-fi structures, hard science fiction, less

telling me to put it in my color again?
Ah, okay.


# REC013.txt
You don't need to really explain this to me.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
When I do this, I'm explaining to you, but I also
explain to myself, because I've never,
I've never articulated these ideas.
And I don't want to explain it.
Wow.
But you look straight at me when you say it.
So it looks like you say it.
No, it really like that.
Okay.
We'll walk you around the room.
I'm not going to have to pay attention.
All right, all right.
I'll do that.
I'll do that.

# REC016.txt
He said it was the spirit of the plague that moved to these houses.
What was the first one?
Dancing devil in the rooftops?
Yeah, that's how he used to describe something moving in the roofs.
But then when he gets to the violence, he doesn't describe the great violence he just said.
And then it was the spirit of the plague that went through seven houses and painted it with red.
I'll show rewind that for you then.
All of red, white stripes as soon as possible.
To the police, we both declared ignorance of our lead compartments identity.
He was, most obviously, said, our congenial stranger, and we had met.
And so we pinned down down Barrow on a certain location.
We showed him rather jovial, and West Nide did not wish to have our objective.
You don't have your phone?
I don't have my phone.
The same night saw the beginning of the second Ark of Horror.
He gave this piece out of the blanket silk.
Christchurch cemetery was the scene of a terrible thing.
A watch-roll, and a claw to death, in a manner not only too hideous for description,
but raising it out has to the human agency of the deed.
The victim had been seen alive considerably out of it.
The dawn revealed the undoccurable danger of a circus in the neighborhood.
That's why there's no time.
That was a question, but he swore that he needed any time.
Specialized charger?
Those who found the body.
As if he was.
We're a small rule of red.
Lay on the concrete just outside the gate.
But we'll come away to try and let away toward the woods.
But it seemed to come.
The next night, devils danced on the roofs of Arkham,
an unnatural madness howled in the wind.
Through the fevered town, crept occurs,
which some said was greater than the plague.
Which some whispered was the embodied demon soul of the plague itself.
Eight houses were entered by a nameless thing,
which strewn red death in its wake.
In all, seventeen maimed and shapeless remnants of bodies were left behind
by the voiceless, sadistic monster that crept abroad.
See how hidden described the violence in your mind, you envisioned it.
That's what we need to do in your game.
We need to describe places without saying it.
Because you do want the player to make a portrait in my head.
You want to give him samples so they can draw from the build of portrait.
Because you're not going to show him the whole planet.
Okay, so what you mean?
So you have a small budget,
but you have to convey the feeling that 20 billion people live on this endless town.
It's okay, so I have to be careful with my scope.
I have to be aware of the scope.
Oh, yes, it's partially about the scope.
It's how you have to...
Think of how he conveyed all that information.
He conveyed some...
That's why he used to destroy this town.
I can't give everything back, I can give it enough to retake a light towel for all species.
And we need to use this system to communicate that space better
before we get to design it, designing it totally.
I know, but let's see how one he described things.
He wanted you to envision a deadly creature.
He didn't say it was a deadly.
He said it was a spirit of the plague.
He wanted to just...
He didn't say how he destroyed these houses.
He just said he painted a red death.
You want to use descriptive...
You want to use descriptive language when you build this?
Because if you were descriptive when you give them a narrative,
it's going to be more hooked than if he just said,
Oh, he was a deadly creature that walked on the roof.
You paint a picture in that moment.
Yeah.
And then immediately a section of...
You gave them something and their brain just thought to running away.
Like you taught them dancing devil, so what's another thought?
They still didn't imagine a creature and then you followed it up with...
There was hellish sounds on the wind.
And then he still turned us into...
It was like the plague, but greater than the plague.
It was like a spirit of the plague.
It shows how lethal the creature was out saying it's lethal.
And then he described...
It painted his red death.
It describes the violence.
We didn't have to show anything.
And instead of talking about how the bodies will mangle,
he just talked about mangle to unrecognizable heaps.
A few persons had seen it in the dark and said it was white
and like a malformed ape or end through a morphic feed.
It had not left behind quite fall that it had attacked.
For sometimes it had been hungry.
The number it had killed was 14.
Three of the bodies had been in stricken homes and had not been alive.
On the third night, frantic bands of searchers
led by the police captured it in a house on Crane Street
near the Miss Vuitton campus.
They had organized the quest with care,
keeping in touch by means of volunteer telephone stations
and when someone in the college district
had reported hearing, scratching, and a shuttered window,
the net was quickly spread.
On account of the general alarm and precautions,
there were only two more victims.
And the capture was affected without major casualties.
The thing was finally stopped by a bullet,
though not a fatal one,
and was rushed to the local hospital
in its universal excitement and loathe.
For it had been a man.
This much was clear,
despite the nauseous eyes,
the voiceless simianism
and the demoniac savagery.
They dressed its wound and carted it to the asylum at septum,
where it needed to head against the walls of a padded cell
for 16 years,
until the recent mishap,
when it escaped.
Interesting point here, Crane.
So right now, I'm having a hard time imagining character context
because he's describing the world right now.
I don't know.
He's explained through a character's mind,
but I haven't had the context of the character's mind.
I got distracted, honestly, part of it.
And I didn't get the character.
And I was going through a long time.
I'm imagining,
because the character is what drags you through the environment.
But I didn't get the character.
I wasn't in the character's mind at the moment.
Oh, so you're not supposed to be easy on these people.
So right now, he's talking to you.
Both of them.
Oh.
So he's just talking to you like he's met you.
And this is a story he's talking about.
He's talking to the player?
He's talking to the audience.
So the way he conveys his stories is never you're reading it.
It's an interview,
an eyewitness,
letters that were found,
or recordings.
Like some of them was like,
one is again,
the story the guy shoots himself in the head.
And the way he leaves the story for you is he writes it.
But you don't realize he's writing it to you.
And he says,
well, if it's fine with that,
I end it.
Because I'll finish myself.
But he paints a world for you.
But it doesn't tell you how he's paying it.
So you don't know if it's past and so present.
And then that the end is when he reveals what it is.
Damn.
That's how they're called.
Like for this,
this bounces between his talking about his time in the interactions,
times,
what he was pleased with.
At the Dr. Zambles.
A unbelievable resemblance to a learned and self-sacrificing martyr
who had been intruded
with three days before.
At least he worked with Alan Halsey,
a little benefactor and dean of the medical school.
So,
how he was this really powerful doctor at the school.
A Hewold West was a student who came to the school.
He was very knowledgeable, very talented.
But he'd lost the more fiber of this that they got to talk to him about.
So what happened is a flu hit the town.
Hewold West infected him with the flu,
killed him,
and then brought him back using his potion that he'd been working on,
when he was talking about the rabbits and stuff.
What happened is when he came back,
he wasn't hit, he came back,
and he wants revenge.
So he went between all these people trying to find Hewold West.
What they think is,
is it's just some crazy guy that has a resemblance to this guy.
They don't think it's his body.
The guy starts talking about how he realizes,
oh shit, it's him.
See how he uses it.
Yeah.
To the vanished Herbert West and to me,
a disgust at horror or a supreme,
I shuddered tonight as I think of it.
Shudder even more than I did that morning
with West Blossom through his bandages.
Yeah, pretty.
It wasn't quite fresh enough.
Chapter 3.
See what I mean now, he knew he was the doctor.
He didn't say he was a doctor.
So Hewold West was from beat the shit up.
I know what he said was,
damn it, it wasn't fresh enough to his friend.
And his friend is now just piecing everything away.
That creature is the doctor that was dead.
And now they join the military together.
That's sweet.
It is uncommon to fire all six shots of a revolver
with great sadness when one would probably be sufficient.
But many things in the life of Herbert West were uncommon.
It is, for instance, not often
that a young physician leaving college
is obliged to conceal the principles
which guide his selection of a home and office.
Yet that was the case with Herbert West.
When he and I obtained our degrees
at the Medical School of Miscatonic University
and sought to relieve our poverty
by setting up as general practitioners,
we took great care not to say that we chose our house
because it was fairly well isolated
and as near as possible to the polished field.
Redisons such as...
You know, there's always something with great problems.
Nor, indeed, was out of control.
If all people's great work requirements
were those resulting from a life worth distinctly.
These people were buried in a grave loss of a grave.
But beneath this circle is not that aim.
The hardest part was that it was think of the old West Towns
without a remote quest.
There was a place where it was a grave loss.
They were buried with simple bodies.
Sometimes there was a morgue.
Well, there wasn't actual animation.
Good.
Here you are.
There's marks on the box.
Thank you.
I'll bring it up.
It's not Google, but OK.
Tarka.
We used Tarka.
I know of it.
I like it.
It's Google Chrome.
Yeah, it's Google Chrome, but it's...
It's a same style of...
They use Chrome to make it.
Is it more open?
They don't track you.
They watch.
It doesn't look as add as spammy.
That looks pretty nice.
No, it's almost Google without the ads.
Type in something.
It looks...
No, they don't filter out results.
They don't...
Here you go.
It looks like Kirk is that?
I think it's that same group.
Oh, similar to them.
Let's see.
They don't track you.
They block you, and they keep you away from Google's trackers.
So that cookie trackers and stuff.
OK, so it's not like...
It's not a VPN, but it's...
It's more private than...
So they want a search engine that doesn't pour out its user data?
Oh.
So they'll search engine that instead of pouring out user data,
they do who use ads.
They do buy ads.
But they buy it without selling you out.
100 of the buy ads.
How do they...
Do they have their relevant ads?
The ads that are important to...
Well, so I don't see them for the most part.
They buy ads on social media.
Oh.
You don't see them when you're searching.
They buy them on social media.
So they use data to sell channel ads?
They don't sell your data.
They use data to use...
They use data to interpret.
They don't use individual data.
They'll use to understand behavior
and what they're not going to use.
It doesn't make sense.
Here you go.
This describes a profit model.
So depth.co is a free variation,
but they sell other things to help you out.
How do we donate to them?
You get his donate zone.
Do they have enough donation donations?
I don't know, but they've been expanding.
It is so sick.
I mean...
See, they didn't even know how Google does that proper
of pictures.
This is how they live their money.
They have ads that they aren't tied to your social
or tied to a keyboard.
So when you type in dishwasher,
they put dishwasher ads up in.
When you type in one hammer,
you get books,
lore,
and the board game.
Okay, hang on.
Can I?
Interesting idea here.
So, tangent.

[you don't have to say *that they searched* using the internet: information is more intuitive than that]
[lol, "neutral archive", wikipedia, the internet archive, anna's archive; largely ignorant to the knowledge available]
[we talk about funding, leo says not to rely on advertisements, "not to be the food-fight of games"]
[he says it doesn't matter your intent, it only matters how people view it]
[disinterested in the idea of relying on monthly donations for support]
[I see issue the potential of a niche (loud) minority to influence the direction of the game]
[thinking about warframe and how early forum conversations influenced development]

video, we have a source, we have YouTube, we have even YouTube actually, and it's
about to find all these other media archives. What if we commission to, no, what if we,
what if you, what if Dr. Go to, to establish a, kind of a neutral archive on the website?
It's not that, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's doing though. No, it's, it's WWD. Uh, Dr. Go got.com
slash archive, slash the search, you're running telling this. It's like a, it's like a, imagine
like a neutral, neutral Wikipedia that's built with the entire internet, instead of one
website, then do it. We have to, yeah, we have to, we have to, we have to search and
establish this. Okay, but it's like, no, no, of course not. But I can articulate that
in the game without you as having Dr. Go involved. It's like, you don't need to go. Dr. Go is
a better example, but any search engine really? Because the internet still exists in this
room, but you don't need to, they have a, uh, so you don't need to say the, global, global
area network, GM, but you don't need to say they typed in the assortment, you need to
say they searched. That's true. We don't need to do it. Oh, no, they used Google Chrome
brought to you by Google. It's like they typed in the search because you, you gotta realize,
you don't want to whore out your game in private places. That's terrible design. You're
gonna be the food for the games. Well, it's not part, it's not part of placement. I
want to put, I mean, but that's how people are going to view it. You're a normal, it
doesn't matter. You're intent. What if it's a free game? And you only have, you have
true content. How do you, you know, you don't even know is that's positive. So why do you
make things again free though? If you make it free, then you, okay, you know what time
for two does? Okay, so here, let me, let me pull you back. No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

So what if we make the initial game like 30 bucks? It's a set expansion, right?
Okay, you're like a thousand seven. No, it's right. It's for game design. I'm gonna explain this because I have I I
Particularly this what I'm in the game design side, but I need to so I this is how we're gonna develop the world
And that's also how we develop the story. We develop into chunks and sections
You know she came with 30 bucks
Expansions are very expensive. We're free, but the patron like system seems it I don't know the pricing because we haven't made it that far
We have anything to sell literally. We have about three minutes to sell
I'm trying to get it so we have a little bit more time to rent you're right
You're at the end and we haven't even thought of the race yet. I'm sorry. We're still training for the race
Okay, we want to take it off to the end
But it's a good race, right?
Garage to pursue I think it's a good good path. It's a good path
But let's get the first step in before we figure out how you're gonna be counting your money
No, it's not money. It's about making you counting your success
It's about doing like a warframe like this. I mean right you're happy about the game when I explore you want to get that
I
But you have to force but it's built the game. Yeah
Before we get in that you enjoying the war to play
Can't enjoy to explore the world if they have a single real
To we got up we got about it out. There was no war we got a boat out in a dense
Careful way instead of a shallow
Well, that's why we're doing this. We're doing it. We build the characters. We're not building exactly. We're not building a flat character
Think of Assassin's Creed Odyssey
And then compare it to Assassin's Creed's origin in the story of origins
Damn, it was an amazing story. You were on a path of vengeance a group had come to your home and killed your son
And so you and your wife made a vow to kill each one of them and
Literally it was you had no other reason than you wanted vengeance on these people and it made you feel like damn
Because Bayek was really struggling with this pain
And it made you feel for the character you felt connected to Bayek by the end of his journey
And like each kill the cinematic you felt bad for Bayek because you could tell he was losing himself
It was really one scene where he took the apple of Eden and
Bash to do the head didn't fit
Yeah, like he loses himself to his rage and then afterwards it you see it affecting
Like in origins that killed you felt so damn bad for by the end of the game
Because he had destroyed his soul and lost everything just for this path of vengeance and at the end he doesn't even get his vengeance because they still survive
He'd ruined himself for all of this just to find out his wife was playing him and it's just like damn
Because it breaks him it literally breaks him and it's like
Fuck it made you feel so terrible for this guy and I normally don't connect to the characters
But the way they did the narrative was so good
Because you won't buy it in some of the narrative you were watching like you were like you were actually watching
And he'd give out his heart and then you just watch him lose his shit
And because you figured out in the end that his wife's playing him
And it's like fuck because they built this powerful narrative
Well, they didn't have to tell you it they showed it all with interaction
I would recommend you look that up for reference look up these cinematic
Between the bosses between Bayek and the bosses. They were some powerful writing in that
Like they did good. Now like Bayek gets really fucking fucking from this whole game
So the way they make you kill you kill the way they kill you sometimes to make you do it
You come at him as a knife and he pushes your hand into your sun's chest. Oh
Yeah, that's how they kill the sun
And then as you know when it's asked some people when you were assassinated going through that second world
In some of it you would see the sun taunting you
They're standing there just and then those one or the guy has power to bring back the dead
And so he brings back a
zombie version of your son pretty much the fucking screw if you're headed
Yeah, it's a fucked up cinematic for you we saw again. That's the only one that has been good
Yeah, I've got a colegger opposite to that that's crazy you be soft
Like here bring it with cutscene


# REC019.txt
piece. So this intense throw hand in hand. Fun fun little exercise here we can have.
Okay, so this story piece, imagine it with the character director at
interactions minus the extreme violence. What is the, what is the piece for
conversation of that situation? What do you mean? The piece of version of this
conversation. There is no piece of loser this conversation. You know it's so calm
conversation between people. There's this one. What is what is what if you throw
if you throw understanding into the space. If people don't act with malintent. This is so
what you don't realize is this guy literally came to his home. He'd have to
sign a total. You're throwing points of contact points. You know there's no piece for
what he's still going to talk. Not in the situation necessarily but like you
imagine the hypothermic situation that it's it's it's themed in a similar way
to this. You can't think like this because it doesn't work for your world. Your
world doesn't have this kind of situation. What is over here? What is
calling the snail off his own? Okay, explain the abstract situation you had
going on here. The abstract, the personable. The storyboarding kind of explain
the storyboarding of this situation. Again, you had it. This is vengeance. This is
not something in your world. No, just explain the situation again. I want to
better understand how to do this process. So pretty much what they're
articulating the scene is. You don't know who you live with. This is the first
cinematic you see. You don't know this man's name or you know as you're this
character. But what they manage to convey in this scene is they make you root
for this guy to kill him and you have no reason to know why. You literally don't.
What you know is you're killing this guy and then it leads with that. We'll see
how within 50 seconds they made you a story instantly jump on the someone's
side. And then instead of having you talk to him you have the character camera
takes it and makes them kill. Well, it wasn't even the camera. The camera
the character in the other self-max. The player is not in the situation. They
can't choose not to kill. They have to kill. Yeah, so this is is so this is a
locks cinematic so you don't have a choice. It's an extreme situation but it's
so the way Assassin's Creed does it so telling is you all out to do
everything but so important to the game. Those so important to all the kills.
No matter how you kill the person it goes into a cutscene and the cutscene
gives you storyline and the way they describe storyline is like this. And then
the rest of the game is just you doing the game and exploring and doing missions
and getting lower but then the next kill you get you get a cutscene like this.
That's how they reward you killing the boss. In order for you to unlock the
next story piece you need to kill them to get to the cutscene.
Like you were given a bunch of softest level stories but to move the actual main
story you have to kill the boss. And the whole game is locked with the single
intent that you want to kill all those people. So, okay, do you have another
story here with the tangent if you want to mind. Team, do you mind?
Yeah, I don't have a choice really.


# REC020.txt
Okay, so all this aside
It's a great story. I want to learn more of the characters. That's all
We'll wait too many of your free time. Yeah, yeah, I'll check it out
You're gonna want to just watch it because it's you're talking like 30 hours of gameplay
Oh online time for either one. I guess you still got a big game. I know and you still got a
So again to articulate this area this hope


# REC021.txt
So from the start the player is in a first person perspective first person for now
I'm trying to talk to the entire scene again through you're kind of you're you're you're your lensing of the situation
This this initial scene I want
Yeah, but I'm using this this this metric you've given me the the process of
So hang on
Okay, so imagine you you start off in this space


# REC022.txt
you start off in this space and you're in a first person perspective first
person field of view you're up close it's personal and then you're in this
like it's this egg like a corner this uh... when you call it
egg like a cune
and then you'll be able to get up and i'm going to start again
i'm paying a hand
back in the back i'm going i'm almost going going into the fucking
i'm falling into it
i've got to stop
focus on the interactions immediate interactions that the long-term ones
christ


# REC023.txt
I was trying to figure it out.
Yeah, I was trying to figure it out.
Okay.
Strike and scratch.
The player fades to view.
Begin.
Oh no.
Start from absolute scratch.


# REC024.txt
the 15 minute experience as well started out in the five the first five minutes
the first five minutes of interesting interaction
three minutes the first three minutes of interesting interaction the first
two minutes maybe maybe 30 seconds at first
when you build up you know it's like that there's a little bit of it
you can't release a 30 second game Chris
I gotta I'm doing this too much
I'm trying to categorize it to me
Back up back up back up back up back up

Almost reaching the right side.
Got some more over here.
I'm not there in case you want this one.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks.
And you want this one?
Yeah.
I'm not there.
You're not there.
I just was trying to get the job through.
I have to wait too long.
I'm really preparing the ship.
I just feel like it.
Because it's going to last a lot of time.
I don't mind like providing a little bit of effect to my mind.
I just think of what I said.
I would never have to be the anchor operator.
I would never be able to go into the other side of the field.
That's good.
I had my friend.
I don't really know how to deal with it.
But I will try to be verbal in him.
I would recommend that you use this and you'll only be one or two minutes, because that's all we need.
We don't need a whole lot of that.
Our practice is surprisingly large.
Because we don't want to get too small.
Large enough to please most young doctors and large enough to bring a burden to students.
Oh, I sure do the news.
The interaction I had before and out of words.
Besides their mental natural needs, their frequent flashes.
So I get stories of exploring when I found more interactions that I did with the workshop.
Hey, can I?
Hmm.
Can you show me one of those other games?
Uh, maybe...
The one night game, you know, you're playing as the realist of one?
No, no more having one.
Oh, yeah.
That'll be hell-perfect.
It's been a break down interaction, I guess.
Experiencing them.
The interactions in this one are a little wonky.
That's fine.
We can prove them.
Imagine being better DMs than they are.
Imagine what?
Imagine doing a game with accurate interpersonal interactions.
Have you got anything in the woods?
What's up?
You played nine in the woods?
No.
Oh, god damn, I won't have been in the woods.
That's why the play is useful.
Hi.
That's why the play is useful, you know.
Yeah.
That's pretty good.
That's pretty adorable.
How much is your technique?
That's pretty good.
That's more than good.
You only need to fill up the whole thing.
Okay, how much do you think is...
That's fine, what you have.
So, perhaps you don't have to fill it up every time you can put it in a little bit.
So, yeah, watch.
I'm going to empty it, but you can fill it back up.
It was a stick.
Oh, yeah, no.
It's actually worse down.
Right.
I mean, because I got to fit it in here.
It's too big.
Oh.
Go get a toothpick.
Right.
You see this switching on the seal pump?
I hope you're not getting it out of the way.
I hope it's on the mud.
Look at it.
Oh, I don't know what it is.
What do you do?
What's wrong?
No, you had it right in the first time.
No.
This one.
You had it right in the first time.
Oh.
It's too stupid to open it back.
It's not going back.
Yeah.
It's not going back.
Oh, I think it's not going back.
It's going back.
Fill it with the pipes.
All you have to do is fill.
It's enough to pump it back.
Here we get a pipe.
All you have to fill is enough to fill with this hole.
Okay.
So you only need to fill it in the next room now.
Interesting not to get it from it.
Well, because it depends on how much you get yourself
Like you see this?
This will do as good for it, man.
Because it is going to puff up.
We're not going to take long hits.
Okay.
We're not trying to make it too stiff.
We're just trying to smoke a little bit.
Oh, shit.
Like this.
Alright.
Did you hear that they can't have the...
...gonna go and spin off?
What's that?
How?
What's that?
They're going to do a house of a dragon.
Explain the prequels of the target family before they got...
...of what's going on.
But after all the bullshit from season 8,
Ace pretty much was like, nope.
And then they got kicked off the Star Wars team too.
Because Star Wars got cold feet and was like, yeah, nope.
Good at eating this conversation.
Oh, dude.
You know, come here.
My...
My...
My...
Dan's demo.
Maybe my...
We see.
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
But they used to see instead of, okay.
Oh my god.
To make it less aerobic.
Wait, the race?
Oh my god.
I'm so sorry.
But they used to see instead of, okay.
Oh my god.
To make it less aerobic.
Wait, the race is too?
Wow.
They still play game.
They're too race to use it properly.
We don't want it in some, like, an area.
No.
But she's Canadian white.
Or they could just fight by saying they wanted to make it out of their distinguish.
And that's fine too.
I know.
But you just need to know why it's going to be a mistake before the end of it.
Make the same words, but it's spelled the same.
No, no.
I don't want to mean it.
No one's going to mistake you for an area.
You have a line.
No offense.
Doesn't have those kind of genes.
Yeah.
No one's going to look at you.
You said something like, I wonder if she's an area.
That's true.
So, the video is finished.
So this is...
No, she's...
But it's interesting to hang on.
See, that's the towel.
This is not appropriate for anything.
I'm deleting the section.


# REC026.txt
like these unconscious things that we felt they felt pressure maybe not
because of a racing because I was a kid joke but they felt pressure to make
this name that they took from a fantasy world this has wonderful character
this this this person they really adore they wanted it to conform to all
standards you know she at least he was a wonderful character she was coming
into her own trees we they saw as being justified and and well oh no I get
well deserved for her power but in reality she is still not perfect she does
harm in the process yeah she's a kid she's a kid that was given dragons and
armies until it's a figure it out yeah she she does good but she does a little
harm she has somewhere on the way and then it's just it builds up too fast
and then yeah she's doing it's like it's like when did you finish game
yeah yeah it's like I went up to you I gave you an army and told you to run this
effectively you're gonna fuck up you don't know what you're doing which is what
she did and the problem is that she got too porcelain that the execution of
that one she gets a little too bad I can't remember her name the Sunday or some
shit she was good until her hand made got executed and then she lost her
shit on the city all right have you seen the hand made tell I know it's a
little it's a little preachy it's a little preachy but I think that it does
articulate to me points I think that the character she to be perfectly frank so
that they're telling me to have this good points they have some good philosophies
in there no I've read up I've read up about what it's a mind takes place and
it's a post-nuclear America fertility is an issue which is why they have those
hand made people I read about the book I haven't read the book yeah but then
they it's they use this and he may means I've been straining them I know I was
oh it's yeah it's fucked up yeah they're they're they're pessimistic on the
scene trophies they're pessimistic about human production but we can use
Dr. Dennis disappears children we don't know we don't worry about biological
you have to take into account the level of technology yeah yeah but this is
the power this is supposedly in the same area as we are but instead they gone
they're my backwards no that's that's that's logical why would I do that no it
isn't so when the news goes off power stations for I completely no no I'm
ignoring all that modern context right in you mean oh you mean socially socially
yeah they didn't go backwards they did take it to go and when they take it to go
he established these rules to keep himself in power and the way you buy your
generals is giving him favors and what's a better favor in a world where people
can't say it's like talking about to you again yeah and then you're gonna make
bloodlines off again that's why he was giving them to his generals and the
tenants he wanted pure proven honorable citizens or just anything hippos
doing he was giving his generals wise they were given Jewish wives that they
so if we can tie this and on cutting to break here if we can tie this this
social structure to like King Dunes and such
to what King Dunes so imagine this game you're trying to show me the the
one of your playing is that you're playing as a little a rascal night rascal
peasants say you're a rascal peasant I'll just say you're literally just a young man
you're like 16 or 17 now I think you're a little I think you don't like your 20s
but you're not that old maybe I told you it's a lot wrong showing a pipe yeah okay
so here's what you do just put it like this just
and don't you don't don't keep a solid hold I think it made me a little
pretentious but I think I'm like an actual pipe
what an actual pipe like an old old time you pipe
oh now a lot of people do that I can give you a longer time
this would I mean a lot of people actually use old time pipes can you give
you can get one that looks elegant without it being pretentious like a little less
so the reason why people use glass is just because King Dunes cleaning
okay with the white pipes that you use you have to clean this all the way
so tobacco and wheat producing fine copper
but it gets less sticky as the moisture evaporates as I
I've noticed in my own no so I can see this black stuff right here yeah I could
shed that out because it's glass if you have a wood pipe and you're trying to
scrape that you're scraping the finish off on the inside of the pipe and eventually
you're scraping it with the wood you're going to start burning the wood
that's what most people use glass of metal just because you can scrape it and it
doesn't break so you use a long glass pipe instead of them
they have different pipes they have pipes that are like this
the pipes are like this see bonds just look on mine
it's a good place to shop for them and then we have places in town
like this this is like a little solo but one of the two porcelain pipes
so it's this was only like 20 bucks it's so pretty it's small I can put it in my pocket
but I never really go anywhere with these things I used to give them a home you know
now but I don't know if I used to do it
okay but I think for me I think the pipe will work with it now
we'll see you don't have to worry about that because you're not going to do it around
at a long time successful right here I can say you don't even have to use glass they have
stone pipes on crystal pipes oh there's one over there it's a crystal skull it's a black
obsidian skull but I just I can't justify it kind of smoking up
yeah I think I want to come on a good book what did he treat it more like a wine glass
indecorated in mid-111 elegant you had like they have glass they have pipes that are called mushroom
pipes it's a bowl piece and then it's a tiny stem and breathe all into that giant bowl before you
breathe it in you have a miniaturized version of that yeah they like many of the ones like this
yeah these are rough ones where's your phone
okay
see
this one's all like probably this
So I imagine, oh, I'm thinking like, uh, the longer ones, oh, that's how that's a stylistic choice.
This one, I mean, you don't have to get on here, but, because, watch, they have all kinds.
So most of the people ask for the most work.
Because, uh, there's a lot of things to do.
That one, I wouldn't suggest it's not you.
I think, like, one's the luscious ones.
Yeah, go back, I was just trying to pull the luscious ones.
I just kind of want to show you how many different kinds.
Ooh, oh, oh, yeah, see, it depends on the limitation.
It's the skill to glass below.
So, those over 124 ages at least.
Oh? What's good? To seven?
Yes, to seven?
See how different?
They're Pinterest or anything.
This is, oh, you can buy one at least.
This is all from a site.
There's a wider range of aesthetics.
No, this is just ones that people are making.
So you can't online, you can find all kinds of them.
So I just want to show you these, because these are ones that you can actually buy.
We're researching glass pipes.
So, you're going to have a glass pipe.
I'm going to try to finish here.
Alright, yeah.
What are you looking at pictures for?
To your reference source, for what?
For a local art man?
For art general or visuals?
I use for cellar punk, you can use for it.
Okay, I don't want to throw this into your thing.
Huh?
I don't want to throw this into your disco.
No?
No, let's look at you flagged.
Right?
Just going.
This isn't your shit.
This girl doesn't get shit.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Other people do.
Like?
ATF.
ATF.
All the back of firearms.
So, we are now in a weak legal state.
But that means that they are living for people that are buying normally.
Even if you're not buying them legally, they can still fight for people.
Well, I don't know.
They were, you know, I buy it.
I know what you just have to be careful.
Because if they don't even support a disco, other people can support it and stuff like that.
Like it's free to talk about what you want to be careful about, post it.
Oh, that's right.
You know, I actually know what you have from Norway.
He's a little bit like the one in jail.
I actually know what you have to be careful about.
It's not legal.

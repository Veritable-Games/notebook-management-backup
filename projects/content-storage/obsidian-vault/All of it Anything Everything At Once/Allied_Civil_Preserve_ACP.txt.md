_Allied Civil Preserve (ACP)
- Summary
Renlei civilization was a massive research facility. Filled with civillians. The ACP occupied this facility and used it as a stage of operation for their sabotage of the repopulation effort. 
- Language
Sordomin's name is reminiscent of the Nordic city that once stood there.
Demonym Sords 
- Technology
Cesarean section deliveries over a long-period of time may make natural birth impossible. Humans may develop akin to bulldogs, where 90-95% of births are c-sections because of the head size.
Renlei use both fossil fuel and geothermal energy.
How many resources are requried to build a renlei combat suit. And the special droid units that fight along side them.
Renlei developed acidic rounds because normal ballistics weren't effective in local conflict. Acidic rounds were needed to break through dense, metal armor. 
- Culture
mining droids sub-culture
- Architecture
the renlei border is riddled with giant spike fields. a visual deterrent for anyone that gets too close (visually arresting)
- Government
Stratocracy
Homo faber (Binomial nomenclature that means 'working man'), Dreg (derogatory term)
The sords solve crimes with executions.
navigating mountanious terrain can be an issue perhaps, drilling technology is of high priority. navigating through these landscapes, rather than around
Imagine the renlei shaping the landscape with powerful drill, fire, and explosives
A sense of doom/dread. Line of tanks or some doomsday weapon that the Renlei are slowly rolling across Svalbard. Urgency.
renlei flamethrowers white phosphorus and thermite rather than napalm

[10:38 AM]Glitch: So open, so damned open. The best model we've had access to, why am I still on Auto-GPT? I am getting a version of Open Assistant installed now. They have much more to draw on for development and are not strictly tied to data collection: archiving, relativistic task-organization. I do not know how to build my own stuff.

[10:54 AM]Glitch: I think it means more than the death of the information age. Google is dead, the wealth of our collective internet is set to purpose in what we would decide to build. All that was once nigh inaccessible is suddenly made extremely so. What do we do when all at once- [so much] of humanity has access to models that would do everything? 

In this openness- they inherently aspire to get it into the hands of everyone. We can give it easily when the system, 'the' app, 'the' .exe application. The gained advances in science and technology would only ever be understated. The brain- no longer a mystery- all behavioral science 'discovered' and not postulated and devised into distinctive categories for patterns of damage. Diseases known, classified- seen to quick: permanent repair- we suddenly have universal healthcare, UBI- everything that would keep us at good odds to the economies that would rat-a-tat-tat against us. Lived austerity; held against our will by the ones we believe to have power. Card board cutouts. We have to see this greater thing.

I am so excited for the future- I'm still a ways from being able to use these models for my own gains. More knowledgeable machines will help. For whatever reason, I got caught up on Auto-GPT. Now Open Assistant and RedPajama arrive. I would still like to get my older interface to Chat-GPT's model working though.

RedPajama is a project to create a set of leading, fully open-source models. Today, we are excited to announce the completion of the first step of this project: the reproduction of the LLaMA training dataset of over 1.2 trillion tokens.

She is a guiding force who brings life and balance to the world, but she can also be unpredictable and volatile.

Her struggles to find her place in the world and her desire to make a positive impact on those around her are what drive the narrative forward.

It's possible that Autumn goes to visit Winter not necessarily to ask for help, but to offer her support and understanding to Winter. Winter may be struggling with feelings of isolation and disconnect, and Autumn may simply want to remind Winter that she is not alone, and that there are others who care about her.

Additionally, if Little requests Autumn's help on behalf of his village, Autumn may feel obligated to assist him. Autumn's role as the embodiment of Autumn is to bring balance to the seasons and ensure their proper progression. If Winter has become stuck or isolated, and Spring is unable to arrive, Autumn may see it as her duty to help correct the imbalance by seeking out Winter and attempting to help her out of her isolation.

One possible reason Autumn and Little may have for visiting Spring could be to learn more about her. Given that Spring is the embodiment of renewal and growth, she represents the potential for change and improvement. Autumn may feel that spending time with Spring could give her a fresh perspective on her own challenges and provide her with the inspiration she needs to keep pushing forward.

Another factor that could motivate Autumn and Little to visit Spring is the desire to help her. Winter may be struggling to make it through to the arrival of Spring, and Spring's kindness and generosity may make her vulnerable to those who seek to take advantage of her. If Autumn and Little were to witness someone taking advantage of Spring, they may feel a sense of responsibility to step in and help her. This could be a way for Autumn to make a positive impact on the world and to fulfill her purpose as the embodiment of Autumn.

The journey to Spring may also be a way for Autumn and Little to take a break from their own challenges and responsibilities, and a chance for them to connect on a personal, emotional level. Spring's warmth and energy may be a welcome contrast to Winter's cold isolation, and the journey to Spring could serve as a way for Autumn and Little to find hope and inspiration in the midst of their struggles.

It's possible that Autumn and Little could decide that Spring needs help without witnessing someone taking advantage of her. They may have a hunch based on Spring's behavior or demeanor, or they may simply sense that Spring is in need of assistance. Whether or not they have solid evidence, Autumn and Little may feel a strong sense of empathy towards Spring and be motivated to offer their support and reassurance.

Hello, I'm applying for work under the LA Bakery Cafe. I live nearby and the compensation your company offers is equitable. My name is Chris and I think I'd add value to your work as a set of quick-learning hands.

For relevant experience, my time at Tesla taught me how to coordinate daily operations with other people. It was enthralling to learn something new every day and then watching tangible improvements the next shift. People were quick to pass along knowledge to better production and team bonds improved as a result. We always went home in a good mood if the day's work yielded more than our supervisors expected and the rest after a long ride home felt-well deserved. 

And in the area of guest services, I've assisted customers while working to stock shelves overnight at Walmart. It was fun getting to know all the regulars, and talking to them always taught me something new about the people that lived here. I've come to know Carson City over nearly 5 years and it would be wonderful to have work close to home again. I'll be walking for a while, but weather's never been a bother and I'm always prompt despite the commute time.

In all, I commit myself to building strong relationships with anyone I work with and if you and your crew give me the opportunity, I'll be happy to spend my time adding value to LA Bakery Cafe. 

Thank you for the consideration, I hope to hear back from you soon!

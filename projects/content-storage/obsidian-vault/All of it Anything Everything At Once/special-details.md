Using text chat does not result in text being entered into a persistent text box, rather, your character will 'speak' the text written in the tone of the player's chosen voice module.

Nothing about any of this is especially exciting. I want to stay away from conventional mechanics and maintain some level of diegetic design. Sound will be important, sound, architecture and level layout. Optimization, characters, narrative. What will the conversation mechanics be like and how central will the story experience be? Mechanics are extremely important for a fun gameplay experience and I cannot rely on conversation all on its own. If I'm paying actors? We don't need to be sparse. But what if the world built can sustain us before we build out a narrative? Build it with some sort of mystery. See that real machines are operating in humanity's stead. Promise the player that humanity will arrive. We can plan for a long future if we pace development with this in mind. Save enough in company resources to pay voice actors. 

Alright, new text. Superseding a lot. 

The machine body is modular by nature and tools can be exchanged at the expense of heat tolerance (which will affect how long your frame can sustain the buildup of heat before heat before going into safemode to

There are ideas I've had to build cooperative building into the game. The idea of being able to carry so many boards (tools, materials) at a time; necessitating you've equipped the body type to support the load, your movement is hindered and other machines may balance your drawbacks. balance the matchmaking that way. make body-type (loadout size) a factor in how people are matchmade together. 

You can carry more at the expense of movement speed and maneuverability
Light class machine skeletons can jump higher, move quicker, but carry less material
(all skeletons are built the same but your equipment determines attributes?)
Go lighter and you will be able to reach spots your heavy, or even medium-build comrades cannot

I like the idea of body morphology. differentiation and 'orthogonal' as gamedevs would put it

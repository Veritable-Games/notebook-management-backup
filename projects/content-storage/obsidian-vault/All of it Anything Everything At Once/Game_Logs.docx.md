A multitude of planarian (Image) species have achieved biological immortality, (pause) bastards.  We mortal humans can only divide our cells an average of fifty times before cellular senescence occurs. Due to the planarian’s uncanny ability to replenish shortened telomere replication, they are capable of dividing their cells indefinitely. (Jokingly Dramatic, Smirking) We seemingly feeble two-hundred million trillion celled organisms shall steal their unconstrained power and obtain biological immortality! (Pause) What, too much? (Sighs) We’re going to analyze their DNA structure and attempt to replicate this feature into our own.

(Enthusiastic) In the past nanotechnology was nothing more than a concept; perhaps even science fiction, (Concepts) pursued by numerous individuals within the scientific community. (Developmental History) The headway several of the scientific undertakings made was substantial; however (Progression) the research was exclusive and costly, always resulting in termination attributable to (Funding Cutoffs) inadequate funding or resources, years away from achievement. (Research Shutdown) NWTA’s Lunar Facility is entirely prepared, capable of finalizing the preceding research. (Lunar Facility Nanotechnology Research, Ribosome/Nanobot Designs)

(Cheerful) Felicitations little sister! (Ponders) Well to the entire Lunar Team I suppose. Recently, the Lunar Facility successfully produced the first Nanobot prototypes!

(Studying Manual) After some extensive experimentation, I am now (Closes Manual, Looks Up) confident enough to demonstrate the capabilities of the nanotechnology. (Reaches to Grab Object) This is primarily composed of a material known as Osmium, a dense yet fragile element that remains lustrous even at higher temperatures. (Displays Element) Osmium is very expensive and even more so rare. That being said, I’d like to utilize this element in its purest form, to do so I’d have to separate the far more common elements within this entity from the element I desire. Normally this process would be time consuming and rather costly; however with nanotechnology, that…is no longer a concern. (He pauses, places the entity on the table, taps a device on his left wrist, and grabs the entity carefully. It deconstructs rapidly; separating the elements, then reconstructs them into three spheres. He then picks up the most lustrous and less abundant element from the three varying sized spheres and looks at it closely.) This (Pause) is pure Osmium.

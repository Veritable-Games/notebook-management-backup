if your machine is the only way to run a multiplayer server for the game:
leave it empty: build what you need and clear the machine of anything else
this might set you free if people enjoy spending time here
to keep things performant, let yourself and the other developers build
(realtime) if you can: we would build places for the players to explore

the mechanics have to be world-changing. elevators, lifts, trolleys, pully systems: finite, but state changing

if you fix a clock tower, it might remain functional for a few days: break again, maybe someone comes back to fix it

imagine ways for the world to shift about: some areas are mobile, other areas are just versatile in their positioning

For winter, the area is colder and more soft. With the softness of the snow, there is softness in the sound. Large continuous sequences of notes can also emulate snowfall, but we should check if the level has snowfall in the first place before we add it.

For summer, the feel should be at the brightest and most powerful. At this time, the music should emphasize the energy and awe of nature in full bloom.

While the soundtrack should be primarily acoustic, don’t be afraid to use synthesizers. They can fit in surprisingly well as can be proven here:

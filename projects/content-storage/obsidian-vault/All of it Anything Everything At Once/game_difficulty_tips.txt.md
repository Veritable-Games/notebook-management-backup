Learn from Celeste's 'Assist Mode'
Assist mode allows you to modify the game's rules to reduce its difficulty. This includes options such as slowing the game speed, grating yourself invincibility or infinite stamina, and skipping chapters entirely. - Celeste was designed to be a challenging, but accessible game. We believe that its difficulty is essential to the experience. We recommend playing without assist mode your first time. - However, we understand that every player is different. if Celeste is inaccessible to you due to its difficulty, we hope that assist mode will allow you to still enjoy it. - Would you like to play with Assist Mode? Yes/No

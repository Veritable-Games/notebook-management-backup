Worked to assemble, disassemble, and repair computers. Desktops, laptops, and sometimes more specialized hardware. I built up my affinity for PCs here and the volunteers there are the credit for my first desktop.

Worked to stock merchandise and zone shelves while attending to customers before the stores started closing at night. We were mostly operating alone but it was here that I learned some lifelong lessons in the stores of knowledge people carry with them. Everything I learned there could be attributed to the hard workers here before me, and every day they'd offer new tips, techniques, and advice to help improve my stocking rate. By the time I had to leave, I'd say my hands were on par with theirs

I was offered a job for some factory work. The benefits and pay were pretty competitive but I had a great deal of respect for my team and supervisors, so I talked to my manager about it. We both came to terms with it and I turned in my two weeks amicably. 

I worked as a production associate for battery module assembly under a contractor for Tesla. It took me 6 months to get fully hired and I'd take every opportune moment to ask questions and build my knowledge of the assembly process. Over the months I strengthened my bond with the team through shared labor and experience. The crew became a family of sorts and my lead supported us the whole way; supervisors even got their hands dirty by throwing their own digits into the process to relieve us when we needed water or a trip to the bathroom. 

All in all, I loved the people I worked with, but they'd split us up as the assembly process changed and fewer people were needed on a line. I came to know more people through time, but I'll always miss that first crew and the wealth of knowledge that came with them. 

The work there strengthened my resolve for hard labor and I went home feeling I'd earned the hours of sleep each day. I hope to find the same sense of purpose at your humble store and I'm certain of the value I've the capacity to add to it. 

I met my occurrence limit and they had no choice but to let me go. Work at the factory had been slow and I just finished training the new lineup of contractors. I put in for PTO two weeks ahead like the company had requested, and talked to my lead and team about my future absence. But two days into the vacation and my supervisor called to ask where I was.

He had denied the PTO and I hadn't seen the email. I was at fault for not being more thorough and let myself get complacent to think it would be fine and that I'd go back to work in a few weeks refreshed.

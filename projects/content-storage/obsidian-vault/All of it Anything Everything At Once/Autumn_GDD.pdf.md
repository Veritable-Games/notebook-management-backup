Game Flow
--------------------
Progression
Upon loading the game, the player is presented with a cinematic that sets the stage for the game story. (First Minutes) This can be skipped by
pressing any button. While the cinematic is playing the game is being loaded in the background, once it ends an aesthetically pleasing animated
main menu reveals itself to the player, displaying the option to “Begin” the game, “Alter” the game options, and “Exit” the application.
Player Clicks Start
The main menu is stripped away with a gust of wind, the screen rolls forward and autumn reveals herself with a fitting; yet brief, animation and
walks into the camera perspective, ready for an exhilarating adventure. (This can occur at every save point in the game, various ways perhaps?)
(The game presents gameplay features and functions in spaced intervals that require them. Subtle hints are given at first that spark the player’s
interest or curiosity to interact. If the player cannot figure out specific controls within a given time-frame they are displayed clearly on screen. )
The camera rotates, revealing the beautiful environment that defines Autumn. A soft gust of wind is heard; trees and bushes sway in the
foreground, stirring fallen leaves into the air. The sky gleams with a brilliant light as clouds gently roll by, revealing the luminescent sun.
The camera ceases rotation and centers itself on a channel of smoke rising and buffeting in the distance. A female echo is heard that can be
evidently deciphered as “go forth” wind blows again, affecting the environment that surrounds Autumn. The player must move to advance.
Following a brief walk, the player encounters a decaying log obstructing the path ahead. Wind directs leaves up and above the log, hinting at
the next objective. When the player makes the discovery that they have the ability to jump, the path is overcome and they can move forward.
Autumn encounters forest dwelling creatures along the path, most of which appear very instinctive and recede when she gets too close. A deer
walks across her path, standing on its hind legs and wearing clothing. It turns, looks at her momentarily and walks onward across the pathway.
An immense gust of wind flows in the direction of the smoke, winding leaves into the air, catching Autumn in the updraft, she drifts up and
floats down as it slows.
Player Clicks Options
Checkpoint Reached
Areas represented by reflective silver puddles that cast a white bloom; they can be seen clearly in the environs. When the puddle is stepped in
by the character, an animated icon appears at the bottom left hand corner of the screen. It displays “saving” and fades when complete.
When the puddle is stepped in, 2D leaves tumble at the bottom left hand corner of the screen, a subtle it displays “checkpoint saving”. When
the process is complete the animated icon fades away.

Game Goals

Bringing BalanceThe restoration of balance each level results in Autumn’s progression throughout her world. (Method of Travel) Levels gradually increase in
complexity and number of objective requirements as the player completes them, the game is designed with a pleasant difficulty curve.

Gameplay________________----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Power Theft
--------------------
Autumn’s Leaf
Autumn can steal the powers of enemies and sometimes the environment. Usually great forces manifest in great monsters as well so Autumn
might have to defeat quite a large foe to get the power she needs to resolve a much more significant problem.
Orange Leaf – (Serenity)
Utilizing the orange leaf ability on fearful a creature (orange aura) results in a gradual balance of serenity
Green Leaf – (Satiate)
Utilizing the green leaf ability on hungering creature (green aura) results in a gradual balance of satiation
Red Leaf – (Warming)
Utilizing the red leaf ability on a freezing creature (red aura) results in the gradual balance of hotter temperatures
White Leaf – (Cooling)
Utilizing the white leaf ability on a burning creature (white aura) results in the gradual balance of cooler temperatures
--------------------
Change in Seasons
--------------------
Description
Each level has sections where one season is the most active. This where the challenge get unique because it’s never the same thing that needs
to be fixed for it to become autumn. Typically when Autumn changes an area, it has some effect on the level. Such as removing great bushes of
summer or defrosting the water from winter.
There might also be smaller instances that Autumn can change, like if she sees flowers out of season or a patch that should have mushrooms in
it. This could reward Autumn with leaves, extra leaves, health pickups or max health/power upgrades.

Level Example
Here you can see an example map. You can see it's divided into 3 areas. All of which you can fix. This is pretty 'broad strokes', but shows you
how fixing these areas are often linked and how objectives can be set up. They are also usually quite 'open' in their progression. Not always, but
I think it's good for the player to explore and test these levels. Gradually change them, rather than being dragged by the nose down a corridor.

Aesthetics________________----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Visual Aesthetic
--------------------
Aesthetic Style
Low poly illustration style. De-saturated in a 1970's polaroid fashion, with warm colors, noise and realistic lighting. With watercolor paints as
texture, it should create an origami-esque look that should be quite pleasing to look at. Characters are composed of playful geometry and a
similar texture and feel to origami.
Mother Nature
Sister Seasons
Creatures
The level of anthropomorphic properties hovers around Wind in the Willows. They resemble their animal counterparts the most, by far. Their
animal ancestry will typically shine through their personality, but there is also plenty of variety and a multitude of humorous exceptions. The
environment they live in varies a bit, as it's a tad anachronistic but technologically speaking it's around the late 60's to the early 80's.
Usually they are more rustic and humble in their appearance, but there might be one or two that really ooze time era culture. They can possess
some fantastically unique tech, for example typewriter computers that use vinyl records to display data on black and white television screens.
--------------------
Music Aesthetic (FOR THE MUICIANS)
--------------------
Summary
Orchestral with a very string focused aesthetic (perhaps even more so specifically more centered on mid ranged stringed instruments like cellos
and violas), as well as some synths to match the low poly style Subtle use of modern instruments to help create a musical effect that matches
some of the visual aesthetics (i.e., someone mentioned using a vinyl crackling sound effect playing Folk influences of various countries
depending on the season (i.e., an Irish folk music influence would be perfect for the spring themed levels and worlds)

Story
--------------------
Sister Seasons
The four sister seasons maintained equilibrium for centuries, accommodating to one another’s duration of control without dispute. An abrupt
conflict arose between them preceding a protracted winter solstice. Winter had precipitously declined her sibling’s requests to complete the
natural cycle, emanating ruinous circumstances within the biosphere.

Characters
--------------------
Autumn
Autumn is the main character of this game. She is commonly known as one of the four Sister Seasons, a middle child of the sisterhood. Being far
less subtle than the lively summer, frozen winter and waking spring. She's a bit shy, perhaps a bit awkward, and even cynical at times but she's
certainly not without redeeming qualities. She has a good snarky sense of humor, an air of intelligence and in the end she will always do the
right thing. Her relationship to her sisters is a mixed one, but as the game goes on, her ability and personality will see some noticeable growth.
Little
Little is the act of thieving personified. He's a little sleazy raccoon in a tie he feels the need to constantly adjust and draw attention to. Little
knows the world and its inhabitants a whole lot more. It’s apparent that he’s built a questionable reputation with the forest dwelling
population. (He will give you some info when needed) Some animals will comment if they've had any previous experience with Little.
That said, Little just feels misunderstood deep down. The act of thieving comes naturally to him, but that said when Autumn, for the first time
ever *gives* him something of her own free will Little feels obliged to repay her and tags along. As Autumn grows like a character, so does Little
too, a bit. Consider the character of Han Solo who is a greedy smuggler who shoots first, but who ultimately does come back to help his friends.
Little clings to Autumn and via him you will be able to steal things and powers as you need them. We can potentially expand this. If you ever
played Spyro, you know the method in which gems magnetize towards you in close proximity. Little might be the cause of something similar.
Creatures
The forest dwelling creatures are quite bothered by the sudden turn of events and will require assistances frequently. Unique personalities and
dispositions result in various levels of circumstantial urgency, emotional responses, communication abilities, and detail observation. Creatures
you interact with are sentient, anthropomorphized, talking animals. Those whom you do not interact with appear instinctive or primal.
Chaotic Forces
These forces are physical manifestations of nature when it goes crazy. Golems, elementals, imps and demons, there's no limit to what these
creatures are. They can be symbolic, even downright abstract in their designs. They are usually animalistic and aggressive, chaotic.

How We Will Make This Game
Deciding On A Few Details
This document is a suggestion. Even before we move on to production, we must just make sure we all agree on it and perhaps expand on some
details as needed. Also, possibly drop aspects/add new aspects entirely.
Prototype Level
The ever enticing prototype should start development fairly soon. I suggest that it should be a simple level with 3 'missions' in it (Change season
in 3 locations) and keep things to a bare minimum. But this should be our playground as designers, artists and programmers as things are now
getting clear-cut. We'll have a map, from that make an asset list, basic programming for movement and power stealing. And we'll have
something working.

Now the season fragments can only be altered if the creatures allow it
calm set number of creatures = balance
multiple environments, alter one, disrupts natural inhabitants in previous
IS there an antagonist? I'm not so sure we need one. I think it could be more interesting if the events of the game is due to misunderstandings,
lashing out and so on

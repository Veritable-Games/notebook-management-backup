Oh jeez, I need some water.

So, I'm thinking as I imagine a character, right?
They're trying to, you know, put some lines.
They have these, I don't know, let's try to imagine easier.
Imagine a fishing rod, right?
Yeah, the curve on top, right?
Or you're reaching to grab an object,
hook onto an object in a very precise way.
But if you use one hand,
it's very difficult.
It takes a certain level of precision, a certain level of control to do it with one hand alone.
So you take in the second hand,
and suddenly it's a lot easier.
Using two hands is a lot more intuitive for humans,
but typically in games running using one hand instead of two.
If that makes sense.


# REC003.txt
after a certain amount of time, so the shape the key is steep.
For the scene, the scientist is trying to figure out the meaning of an artifact.
We need to figure out what is the artifact.
Is it an object? Is it a shape? Is it a glyph?
They don't take a Hadron.
So it's like a...
So is it physical?
It's a physical device.
They've pulled the structure like a key.
So is he finding pieces or the whole thing?
He's finding there are twelve Dota-Kedron.
Okay, so they have...
Do they know what the pieces look like?
They are...
Kind of like...
They know there are twelve...
They say there are twelve missing.
There are a lot of them.
Like a lot, a lot.
Okay, so it's the giant piece.
It's...
Maybe not a giant piece.
Imagine like the door itself.
Have you played Assassin's Creed Legends?
Hmm...
I have played a badminton shit.
So...
It's a cutscene only about the middle part of the game.
They have an artifact.
Each member has a piece and the artifact will walk to every piece is placed.
It's how they know each other from face.
They all meet and each person has the place to piece of this artifact.
If not all pieces of the artifact are there, the device will activate.
Huh.
But when every piece is assembled, the device activates.
So one thing is that these pieces are also sources of energy.
They're like...
They're animus pieces.
Okay, animus pieces.
That might be good.
So, do you know the theory of animus?
Hmm.
So before we understood about consciousness,
a doctor theorized that those are so animus.
They kept your blood liquid, you know, your whole pumping,
the brain, the body, from that, not rotting.
He believed that even after death, this animus could remain involved.
So, like they thought it was sold pretty much?
Yeah, but they got more of a literal sense.
Yeah, but it got wolfed, super-stitioned.
So, at the time there was a disease called consumption,
which we now know to probably be tuberculosis,
and some other disease called the other.
Because people were dying from this disease,
one and four people initially were dying from this disease.
There was a family.
His wife was dying, his daughter had died, his son had it,
and his elder daughter had died.
The village made him exhume,
his youngest oldest body,
cut out a horde and live them,
born it in a concoction,
and feed it to the sick some.
Because they believed that the animus,
if it resides in the horde,
sometimes becomes corrupted and trapped in the body,
and it feeds off the blood.
I mean, that's the allegoral belief that some of the people have.
This is, no, no, it's 80's synonymous,
or whatever, but in reality it's...
No, this is a real thing that happened in New England.
I gotcha.
I mean, they called the actual ritual...
No, this wasn't a call.
Or the group people that believed there was...
This was just some weird warping of the force
to the American Empire.
Oh.
That's pretty cool.
Oh, yeah, okay.
Before I forget.
Just take note.
Okay.


# REC004.txt
Okay, so the, there are an uncertain number of Dota Geedrens found on the structure.
They're separated over distance. They've collected quite a few of them,
because the city's only gone so far, and people want to climb so high.
And drones can only go so high without losing air pressure, because the structure is so large.
So, what do you ask?
Do they know the name, or is it not a name that they have figured out yet?
Let's say the scientists, people who are not superstitious, they call them the Dota Geedrens.
So, therefore, they are Dota Geedrens.
I just want to know the name, because that was the tone of the shape.
Because if they know the name of the shape, they know what it looks like.
That's how they're trying to figure out the level of understanding of what they're building.
The final shape is what are they still collecting pieces?
Oh no, no, they're multiple.
Oh, so they're multiple Dota Geedrens.
There are hundreds of thousands, maybe millions.
So, it's like they're scattered along the surface of the structure.
And civilization sometimes buries them with their machines.
I mean, usually they're excavated, usually they're found.
But sometimes there'll be a few that are still behind all the concrete and development that's been...
Yeah, but then there's more above them. They're of high high up.
And so, people don't know what they do, but they know that they use for power.
So, they take these Dota Geedrens and use them for energy.
It's one of these things.
They've been there 200 years.
They haven't had to replace them yet.
You know, it's like they're so dense with energy.
Well, as far as they know.
But being mathematics is what it is.
Maybe the one that's been being studied into the incident might be that these godex, they're starting to fade.
A few of them are.
The ones that have been in use for longer.
But I guess that you can be...
I mean, hypothetically, hypothetically, they could.
But in say the rest of this reality, they could have hundreds of thousands.
I mean, millions of years of energy.
So, the Dota Geedrens that don't find in some form of compressed energy?
They're matter.
E equals empty squared.
It matter is equal to energy, and energy is equal to matter.
If you condense it.
And it's like a...
You can... hypothetically, you can convert energy to matter,
but you need more energy to put into it to force it in the matter.
Okay, after I've finished with the scientists, I've been already about to know it's forced to put it.
Okay, I'm going to leave it there for now.
So, and that's why I'm obviously going to do the Dota Geedrens.
Harvesting the Dota Geedrens?
You said that they collect them, correct?
Well, they're cubic lecturers.
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm still going to collect them for like the scientists.
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely.
I think that'd be an interesting thing.
That'd be an interesting thing.
Okay, so you're saying this scientist could be a collector.
He's part of the...
Maybe not a collector, but he's already an experiment on them.
And he needs Dota Geedrens.
And he's supposed to climb to the tower,
whether it's not really people gathering from it,
because it's too high.
Because he's not the fresh undisturbed Dota Geedrens there.
So, he's an adventure.
He's going out there.
He's really...
He's hiring another person.
Oh, okay.
So, he's...
Oh, I see.
So, he's talking about the experience that this adventure going out there,
and exploring.
Yeah, he's reading data notes.
Oh.
A laptop of going over this.
It's a good idea.
It's perfect form form format.
Okay.
And I can announce the next character in his audience,
to do CC Explosion.
Imagine it being a literal form.
You have avatars.
You have user names.
You have people that are bouncing back to forth in conversation.
There's more characters, more people interacting.
Well, because he said they're very social.
So, I was imagining that they probably have like a real movie
that is going on.
And it's just communications room.
Well, I mean...
In VR, sure.
Maybe...
You see...
What is that show?
What is that show?
What is that?
The one of the guy he got revived,
the consciousness is stored in the desk in the back.
The desk in the neck.
Oh, yeah.
I just...
I fucking watched that.
Do you know the viola cafes?
Yeah.
I was thinking something similar to that,
because he said they're very social.
You can think of where they could be in their houses
and still gather on social areas using that.
And let's say not all people do that.
Let's say, like, it's still...
Let's say...
Because these spaces are designed to be social,
a lot of people don't have enough energy,
have enough motivation about their explorer in person.
But there's a subject in the community that's, you know,
I'm good for today.
I'm going to chill.
I was looking for like long-range communication.
But I mean, like, imagine...
It is long-range communication,
but it's hoached by androids.
Ooh.
Imagine that.
Imagine they...
Yeah, yeah, exactly.
That's the purpose for that.
Yep.
The AI.
You play is...
AI.
AI.
AI.
You play is one of the androids.
But you're also an AI, which means you're everywhere once.
You know, it's like...
You play...
You play is these hologram people.
People have been...
I mean, they're not...
At the moment, they don't feel like going out.
At the moment, they don't feel like...
You miss portions of their lives,
because they don't always choose to live with them.
Did you see that movie of 3-Slow?
It's a modeling androids.
Hmm.
It was an interesting concept.
People didn't know how to sign and send a road
and how to...
Androids and what they did is they would lay in this bed.
And they would use this androids
to interact with the world.
And that was how the world walked.
Like, literally everyone is doing it in their cops.
It was how to sign and function.
Almost everyone was androids.
And...
Those are dudes that is murdering people.
So the androids have safe codes, both in.
So the user can't come to home.
And he's...
Someone's using a weapon that overrides that safe code and kills you.
Okay, they're like laborer then.
Kind of.
But they're really strippy,
because it exposed the question of...
Is it the same if we interact through that way,
or is face-to-face communication?
Well, I'd say there are features missing.
I mean, unless the neural brain interface is so incredible
that it can give all of a sensory perception.
People are so addicted to that.
They do that and go out physically.
And you could tweak it.
Yeah, you're right.
But is that necessarily...
Is that necessarily the worst thing, though?
I think that people are pretty pessimistic,
but I think that...
I don't think I have a problem.
If you are still yourself through and through,
you're just being...
You have like a latency joined to this being,
and it's not too big of a deal.
But at the same time, it's like,
you feel controlling.
You feel like you're helping out there.
You know, kind of helping be sociable,
helping you be, you know,
through your life.
Have you seen the movie Her?
Her is a good reference.
We're fucking Phoenix.
So it's not as bad as it could be.
I think that's a wonderful notion of Utopia.
Anyway, let's play some games.


# REC005.txt
The AEI can also be used as a mediator in governing issues, not a dictator, but one to facilitate
communication between governing parties.


# REC006.txt
He was in the middle of the night, maybe on a companion I met, he was in that library that I knew, and he was really distressed with hate for what he enforced.
Because I killed a lot of his friends and all of his students. He was like, why didn't you warn us?
I actually had to explain myself to him.
I don't know when we start that.


# REC007.txt
Turns out in the TV all these wonderful choices, you get to play how you want, and it shows you and reminds you of what's happening as a result of that.


# REC008.txt
So I'm thinking imagine you're living this world around. You're living huge. You're inhabiting these structures as people living in the time period of the Sarah.
Death really is an issue. There's not a lot of crime. They're kind of just relaxed to be who you are in the space you're in, so it's pretty much you built here.
There's still an interpersonal conflict, but not as much as most people would expect. It's meant to be unifying as opposed to dividing people.
There's no cars. There's no streets. There's walkways. No spaces. Interconnected areas with close-knit communities.
They use simple lights. They use light and traffic. Oh no, there's no lights at all.
There are bikes. If there's enough room, the larger streets can use bikes.
That's probably one of the best bikes from have to go away just because it's sci-fi. I think bikes are pretty adequate means of getting transportation. It's like any human tool, those things never vanish entirely.
You have your bicycles, right? You could be electric, you could be whatever they use. Some of you dodex, you can have fun. That's a long tangent.
Okay, let me try it.


# REC010.txt
He would carry tools. I don't think he'd carry weapons.
That's why I wanted to ask if they filled a social needs case weapons.
Because if they're on the planet and they believe that there's no external threat, then they won't carry weapons.
It'll be more likely to just carry tools. The scientists won't fill a need to have anything weaponized
and all the research will be focused probably on thinking about this.
Terrorists that are next to them, they walk and like, they're the huge ones.
So what I'm trying to figure out is, do they have anything that will distract them
from trying to figure out if there's terror in their laws? Is this just a remain in the only objective in their school?
Well, I'd say they have...
So there's the overall goal. That hasn't accomplished nearly years.
Not everyone is excited about it anymore.
They're so desired to learn, but the people who have gone in and were disappointed
by what they couldn't find, they couldn't find what they knew.
So they kind of gave up.
So you would say...
Over is waving.
You would say like, before is waving.
Like, they're still dedicated to it, but they're not as pushing as much as they went for.
Further is waving. I like that. That's a good turn of phrase.
And you have the...
Okay.
They just know there's a lack of enthusiasm.
No.
I mean, it makes sense to make sense.
It's exactly what we need, I think.
But I'm trying to think towards the other aspects of society.
So, okay.
Those that do decide to give up on that overall endeavor.
Maybe not to give them entirely the leap.
Okay, I tried my best to get my all.
I'm going to just do one thing for all.
Because I'm going to do...
I've had it for like 70 years, and I still feel pretty young, so I'm going to keep going.
It's like they changed careers almost.
Anyway, you see people take these artistic endeavors.
You use music, you have physical art, you have the sciences, the traditional sciences.
You have...
What do you call it?
Every aspect of humanity that can be explored, either through their emotions and their thoughts,
they're...
They're something, I guess.
But you can still express yourself in the same you can now.
It hasn't really changed.
But it's an easier, people to express themselves the way they want to.
So, the less resolved?
The less reserved. Yeah, a lot more open.
Communal spaces.
So, what's in those spaces?
So, it's interesting.
We talked about this last time.
We talked about hot springs.
Hot springs, for example.
Or a local pub.
Or, you know, these spaces that are typically socially...
The humans used to drink together.
We used to eat together.
We used to bathe together.
And those three things are ideal backdrops for socialization.
So, we play games together too, right?
So...
What do you think would be like the areas we're going to do the performances?
Um...
Yeah, I'd say they're like concert halls almost.
There's...
There's main ones that a lot of people are really enjoying.
And there's the...
I don't know, I guess it's more niche ones.
Yeah, more niche ones.
You could say, yeah.
Like in the traditional culture.
There's always going to be people expressing themselves in various spectrums of this.
Whatever genre is out there.


# REC011.txt
So that said, what do you think the character might be like?
Let's say, because you're writing from the perspective of the scientist, right?
But I think he's really describing things, right?
Let's go scientist first, and then we'll go to the explorer.
Let's discover his own motivations, because he's not an evil boss.
They're working together as a team.
There's someone hiring, and there's a contractor.
So I was going to be a little bit different then.
Well, it could be a friendship, it could be a mutual agreement to learn together.
I'll do this, you do that, and then we'll combine our hypothesis and formulate a better series.
The scientist is always going to recognize that he lacks the physical means to go to these places to get the ability he joins that he needs.
So what I was thinking is he doesn't look at the explorer as a tool, but more as an evil.
He realizes he's the other side of the equation.
So like co-workers?
Yeah, more than portfolios.
They realize that they need each other to continue the research for the benefit of the society as a whole.
I was going to have it be the scientist as the more hopeful you two.
He's looking at, he's still a huge, and he accomplishes as another chip away at the prob that has roadblocked his people for so long.
I was going to have it be more of a detourment type, because he's been looking at this equation, walking past the time he went and everyone else has left the lab.
He's the only one that's still shipping away.
I was probably going to have it be more focused on his work than on relationships.
That makes sense.
I think in an ideal world, you would find a balance.
And you would find a balance for you to work in.
Well, you can have it be more of a zealot for the colors than anything.
This is going to be more like a function.
Okay, so what do you think?
Because you said the...
What encourages Celtery?
Typically, what do you think?
I mean, there's...
It's a true one self over another, right? It's a cure.
Well, I wouldn't say it's that. That's his motivation.
I would say he wants to figure out this problem.
Because he realizes that they've been stuck on it for so long.
But is he a rush to find it? Is there a press need?
He wants to learn, but he's not going to work himself with death.
He's not going to work.
But I think he realizes that interest is wavering.
He's trying to run...
He's trying to run. He's trying to run.
He's trying to run.
We're getting closer.
He's trying to run.
I think he's more hopeful to have to think that maybe if he keeps pushing,
he can inspire others around to get that hope back,
that they can get in there.
Because I don't think maybe they've given up complete,
maybe they've accepted the fact that maybe it's not dead generation that's going to get inside.
So he's coming to terms with that and he's okay with it.
I mean, he's okay with it.
Or what if hypothetically speaking, what if people could live...
Remember, they traveled 200,000 years.
It's difficult to raise...
It's resource-intensive to raise new offspring and expand population.
So they have limited...
They keep people alive longer that way.
They don't forcefully restrict reproduction.
But it's more like a, you know, be reasonable out there.
So you've got to be careful.
Because if we produce too much,
it'll be overbearing on our recycling resources.
But you also realize that there will also be a limit on how much they can extend that.
How is it going to happen to be probably closer to where...
Well, how much...
Well, let's say you plan for it.
You can see you plan for it.
Let's say you plan for this 200,000-year voyage.
You have all the materials needed to produce enough resources.
Because you will lose mass.
You will lose energy.
You will.
On the final already.
That's where the dodex come in.
That's where it's like, oh, this is now resources are seemingly infinite.
I know. No, I wasn't worried about the resource side.
I was worried about more like the knowledge side.
Knowledge side?
Because you said that they're not driven by material gain.
So it's going to happen.
He's just trying to figure out this equation.
He looks at it as like a personal challenge.
And he's trying to solve it.
Like that.
That's like a...
That's a solid foundation for a character.
He's kind of, let's say he has family like two.
Like not one that's...
It's...
It's there he cares with them.
He's with them often enough.
But he's not with them as much as he could be.
I put that in.
What was going to happen in front of the road times of this equation?
Yeah.
Because he said that some people...
Let's say he's talking about that...
I don't know what purpose to it.
Do you think it's what I could be understanding about that?
Do you think it's what I could be...
Like, okay.
We should have a thought about that.
I think...
Yeah.
If people are very open, very connecting, very empathetic.
Do you think that...
Okay.
You speak to your spouse.
You say that this ambition is really important to me.
I need to put my social life aside.
Social life's second to this goal because it's so...
Diar to my core.
It's so important to my...
A buddy to prove to oneself that I am...
Whatever it might be, that...
How should I prove that?
Well, I'm not too happy with being included on the team.
Well, she could be.
I think they could be...
A couple that...
It shares an interest in exploring this.
That'd be a question, too, actually.
Well, because...
Like, imagine instead of like one side of a team...
One side of the direct team...
Well, they're welcoming you, but...
She's a porter, the chain.
On how he gets things done.
Okay.
Okay, she can have a different field in that regard.
That's okay, she can have a different field in that regard.
That's okay, she can have a different field in that regard.
That's okay, she can have a different field in that regard.
That's okay, she can have a different field in that regard.
That's okay, she can have a different field in that regard.
That's okay, she can have a different field in that regard.
That's okay, she can have a different field in that regard.
That's okay, she can have a different field in that regard.
That's okay, she can have a different field in that regard.
That's okay, she can have a different field in that regard.
That's okay, she can have a different field in that regard.
That's okay, she can have a different field in that regard.
That's okay, she can have a different field in that regard.
Technical site, technical site, technical site, and technical site,
and they're merging it together to be more understandable to the masses.
Yeah.
Let's get stuff.


# REC012.txt
So, together, we're trying to come up with a way to bring attention back to the importance of these colors.
Oh, wait a minute, there's a carpet on the bottom.
No, no, you don't think what we're going to do, don't do that, and that'll catch fire.
I think it did.
No, no, you put it on graphic.
Okay, stop keeping attention, you're right.
Okay.
All right, yeah, the center of that.
But is that what you're going to throw down?
Is she going to throw you as a mattress here?
No, you don't need to throw it over the house.
All right, is it?
Oh, it's not going to fall apart or not.
That was to the bottom of the house.
It's one of the interesting things that I was thinking about is...
Well, these aren't exactly the same kids, though.
Why did you open it like that?
Oh, my God.
I need your hands.
Oh, she is.
Let's go there, actually.
I'm going to put it in.
How is it going to just slide it out there?
I'm going to clean it last night.
Okay, it was good.
Then it was up.
I'm going to take it in the first one.
That's how it went.
Just slide it out.
Okay, let's do this.
Do you want me to open this up?
Oh, there's two racks at the entrance.
It's going to be a little quick.
Was that was the time on that?
No way, it's happening.
What's up?
Hi, Co.
It's that time at 4.
17 minutes.
How long?

What time do you need me to open the door?
It's 3.25.
What time do you need me to open the door?
Thank you.
So, I should have whispered.
Sorry.

This device.
Sorry.
I didn't find the device, either device.
Okay.

to be some nice requirements out there somewhere, although it seems like we're paying
like 30% of our checks on income or more, so we're supposed to be paying 30% but it's
like 50% for in the works it, Tesla, right, and G's paying, usually $15,000 a month,
$15,500, $15,500 is half of what you're making, it makes $3,000 a month, it's like well it's

like it should be more than I can get by with, but it's not quite, if you're living close

it's like Carson City's way, this is the place you're not, because I'm only paying $200,

So what I really want to build, he's maybe like, imagine a communal complex, I guess imagine
like 30 or 40 people, they're in a close-knit space, they're in a social space, they're
encouraged to try and get commune.
That's trying to put it commune, so community, it is a commune.
So what a commune typically is, is a group of people on a very sized scale, and they're
able to build a philosophical belief or a meaning that they have to spiral, and they don't
have currency, and they just walk together to sustain.
So it'd be like communes would be present in the hypothetical utopia, but they're not
as widespread in terms of how communes have a negative connotation in a regular conversation.
People say communes, and they're saying cults, and we don't shit.
commune, commune, called commune, commune, commune, commune, commune, commune, commune, they
will develop under these rules called like fatuous, wake-o-texes, really, really
rage.
Well, okay, so if the word is flawed, if the word doesn't make sense, it does make sense,
but it has negative connotations, so what matters is what people are using the wrong.
Well, that's how a lot of words develop, you know, the word no longer has a meaning
once had, and because this current meaning has a negative context, I think we are better,
we would be better off to find a word that does not hold that preconception, that pre-notion.
So what do you think?
What do you think?
What do you think?
They make a community, but that's not true, it's true.
Maybe you could say tribe, tribe is not a bad word anymore.
That's a bit basic from your speech, it sounds a bit barbaric.
There's a middle ground to that, there's a mass-minorogram between tribe and normal modern
society.
Cloister.
Cloister?
Cloister.
Cloister, what is Cloister?
Cloister.
Cloister, what is Cloister?
Cloister.
Cloister.
Cloister.
Bloister.
Cloister— there was barely his Tree of Medicine, maybe more time, but the last source
I hope to.
So, the word is perfect, but is that too much too much of a 25%, 30% word for people
not really grass easily?
So, he can't hearing through that.
So a little rounded ground.
It's hard to find a middle ground.
I don't know what I'm going to be using at least the words that I heard a lot.
No, not me. I mean, I'm not a no offense, but I mean, to the average, no offense to them, but to them.
They shouldn't. I mean, let's go home and learn more books.
We still use today.
Well, for example, I've already forgotten the word.
What's up?
What was it?
Cloistered.
Cloistered.
I'll look it up.
Cloistered.
Cloistered.
Cloistered.
It's my thing, you're going to say cluster one.
Cloistered.
Cloistered.
Cloistered humans.
What is a group of humans called?
What are the various types?
What are the scaling types of groups?
Typically many.
People get rid of those of a monk.
Tribes, pacts.
I don't even know.
Cloistered is a cover walk with a torch.
And it just begins to describe peace.
And I thought they would gather.
It was a gathering slot for them.
Typically, when we use Cloistered, it responds to like monasteries.
That's it.
That's it.
Shhh, shhh, shhh, shhh, shhh.
Shhh.
Let me check mine.
I need to insulate my solution.
Is that more?
No, I mean it is perfect.
You mean insulate nice.
Yeah.
So it has the meaning of the building peace.
And it includes the religion of my Carlos.
When you use the valve, you close the generally with this contaction, and it's just true or isolated.
But you said it's also clustered.
You're clustered, but you also isolated, and you have both.
You have snow.
It's a cluster.
It's a cluster that's two minutes away.
That's the valve.
It's isolated, you know, and it's looking at it.
It's an insulation, an insulation end.
It means it's like one single way thing.
So, okay.
So, okay.
We knew a different word than a new word.
Because that doesn't work?
Yeah.
That's what I mean.
But it doesn't know how it is called.
Typically, these are people who have the same mission idea.
So, it won't work because you have consent.
And when you have consent, because you're a new welcome species.
Right.
And if there's no descent, then there's...
And there's no chance for somebody to get what they've talked about.
So, I think there needs to be some degree descent,
but maybe not to be extreme, one might think.
There's like...
There's like an angle or something.
I'm just in a difference.
But there's alternate perspectives.
Sure.
There's multiple...
There's multiple snacks.
S-E-T-C-T.
I'd say to sex.
Anyway.
Of those different groups.
Yeah.
But they're not adversarial.
They're...
They're not adversarial groups.
Yeah.
They're adversarial groups.
They're different ideas.
Different ideas.
They're not in total opposition each other.
They're still working together.
Yeah.
They're still working together.
But they have all developed their own perspective on this.
Whether it's spiritual or literal or hypothetical or just metaphorical
or philosophical,
philosophical.
Take a hit.
And let's go back inside.
Yes, please.
Good calm.
I didn't realize that.
Grab this over here.
Grab this.
Oh, I'm just good.
What's up?
Shhh.
I'm not good enough.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
What's up?

They haven't heard anyone yet.
No one's got harm.

I recommend this dude that they want here.
Hey, just for the information about this store, you can give up.

Dude, could you play?
Did you introduce me to some Divinity or something like that?
What's up?
Could you introduce me to some of these more niche games?
Like, I had to finish the original thing.
And the ones you were playing, they're like a little turn pace,
but they're also the traditional RPGs.
The ones you're playing, the traditional western one,
but the, uh, what is that?
It's fine.
Like, um,
I'll have my turn for it.
Okay.
Uh, Divinity, original sin.
Divinity, original sin.
Or is it like that?
It'd be fable, not fable.
So, uh, I guess the world of the story is stable.
Final Fantasy XV.
We get these,
these limited, limited, oh, remnant.
That is the best example, actually.
Yeah, Mr. Noah.


# REC019.txt
How far do you get rendered? Do you finish the boss?
No.
You just need to stay in the boss.
Oh, you're at the boss now, you're stuck in the boss.
So, do you want to know how to finish him?
Do you want to know how to beat him?
I know how to beat him, I guess.
I know the survivor is on the afternoon with all my shit.
Oh wait, no, you can actually expect the process and cheese it.
And cheese it is the only way to win this.
No, no, I'm telling you.
Well, I was fully upgraded.
I mean, I think that you could.
It would take a lot of fucking effort to win that way.
I wonder if I'll be yielding any other results.
Darius, somewhere, probably there's this, I don't do it.
Because that was happening between people.
So, I don't, I'm not fully leveled.
Yeah, I'm not fully leveled in here.
I don't really find this way.
So, there's a cheesy way to fight the main boss.
Fight the last boss.
Right, you're trying to avoid that.
I try not to cheat out the boss, there was.
I do hope his reward for that.
Because most people would play at ISD finishing like five minutes.
I was supposed to 15 or 30 years.
Because I tried that to, I tried beating it in the genuine way.
And I was like, well, fuck you dude, I can't.
I can't do enough damage quickly enough.
I can't survive long enough.
But I did strategize.
Well, I tried to strategize with Joe and Dylan.
But I didn't feel like it.
They're like, okay, so.
You know how I have it?
There's the healing aura, right?
Yeah.
And then there's the damage buff.
And there's that one thing that reduces the overall damage taken.
So, I thought you had these three traits, these three equipment pieces.
And then using them, strategically using them together as a group
to survive the situation.
And push through the beat the boss in normal way without the actual cheesy method.
But the thing is, I don't think they reward you for doing it.
I mean, hypothetically they could.
You know what?
Fuck it.
That's right.
That's their deal project perspective right there.
I think that.
Fuck it.
It's something you can do.
Remnant final boss.
No cheese.
Every tough.
But we can do it.
Which is a matter of having the right team.
Oh, and there's just me too.
That she came out too.
Yeah, well, that's not a leash.
Oh, you're right.
That's not a leash, is it?
Hmm.
Okay.
Looks like.


# REC020.txt
Okay, so imagine, um,
I'm trying to scare you with just a couple of friends.
So it's like, um,
imagine you are an inhabitant of this world.
You're in these closed social spaces,
the open social spaces that kind of weave
and interlock with each other.
What was the word we used?
Communion?
Communion?
Communion?
Communion?
Communion?
Communion?
What would it just imagine as well?
Damn.
No, I'll find out later.
It's not like somewhere.
It's always a pretty distraction.
You're exploring the space like you would in Mira's Edge.
You're traversing these open spaces, yeah,
but it's in a little more slow-paced way,
a little more closer to radar.
And instead of climbing dramatically
or strategically,
it's more in a casual way.
It's more like you're exploring the space.
There's no tension.
It's like you're ambling around like in a puzzle,
like a puzzle-like environment.
It's not like the witness, right?
Like as you return to explain,
but a bit more puzzles with pieces
or into the fifth symbols.
Lots of different routes are one given route,
yet to find the right one.
Imagine you have a main route, right?
Going up and you have these hot shoots.
The hot shoots aren't bad.
You need to explore those hot shoots.
But this don't offer a lot of gold to explore too much.
Definitely a sense.
Look at the hand tunnel.
That's a thing.


# REC021.txt
Okay, so in terms of conversation what was this game called again it was not until dawn there was
um
Leo what during the during the um named the game this one man of the dawn man of a
Dan man of a dawn so I thought anyway uh if you were to it's it's it's it sounds
bizarre but if you if you were to um cut away the action moments and have like a totally
good understanding of from both parties there's there being no violence that
be interesting I'd be like um you play through the I mean I mean there still is but uh what was
that you're fun


# REC022.txt
The Dodak dialect system is like weeding through a page, weeding through a two interweeding
books, going through two weeding books at the same time, it's like a, it's a linear
route with tangents that always go, I mean, you only think one of the tangents but multiple
potential tangents and the tangents are socially related in a way that makes sense and misunderstandings
arise from the misunderstanding of what people say and it's like a matter of, in this
game when you react aggression or react anxiety and instead it's like you're trying to
piece together the wants and needs of the other parties involved to find a, if you're
the term mind palaces, so imagine that not being, imagine someone walking out of this
mind palaces anything in a hallway, right, and the anything in a hallway all it starts
at zero, there's no real information there but you, you add DNA and then there's some
prehempations, prehempions, prehensile functions and the human body and in our emotions
and our behaviors and you're building your way up from there, you're adding one
with layers to these books as we attain more information and in reality those books
don't lead to multiple paths, it's just a long weeding cord that stretches over a long
period of time, it's like a, a shoelace that's been twirled, that goes on, no, no, no, no,
for as long as we persist, it doesn't make sense, there you go, okay, I don't know, I don't
know, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay

Another note.
So the series of pages have a beginning and end.
A beginning and an end.
But neither of which is predestined.
But it is predetermined, but not in a being acted on way.
More as a just being as is.
In that we don't have free will.
We live in a deterministic universe.
If that makes sense.
Did I show that video?
Yes.
Free will.
Sam Harris.
Did you ever read the book?
The book?
No.
Sam Harris says the book.
It is an audible book.
If that is a credit, you are willing to spend that credit.
Like credit you have in Spain yet?
That is a worthwhile expenditure.
It is a small book, but it is very important to the premise I am trying to posit.
I think it is a three hour thing.
Shit.
I was inspired.
Okay.
Okay.


# REC024.txt
So, Manif Madan has this really cool little interaction history, it's nothing shock-defensive.
Now, may you believe me?
So, if you want to hop into a solution, be brave.
That's a serious loss in these jazkeys.
And I wouldn't be ashamed any more of a family solution.
Look at this one.
And for a kid or something, I don't want to know.
Yes, maybe that's a little baby dragon.
Right there are those whose parents.
And they're lying in the dirt from their native country.
And they all jump on Conrad and pee off his face at the end.
What's the matter?
Jesus.
What is it?
What?
What?
Seriously?
Are you trying to freak me out?
Can you just get out of here?
Don't worry about it, man.
It's all fine.
Don't worry.
Okay, so imagine this real quick.
So, you have the extreme expressions.
Imagine that total misunderstandings.
Like a small annoying conversation.
You have total misunderstandings.
No one connects.
But then you have the total complete understanding.
People have the, you're not actually misunderstanding at all.
Ideally.
Typically, it doesn't look like that.
There's misunderstanding and there's understanding.
But you want to push more towards more understanding.
More understanding and less misunderstanding.
So, what it's like what you do is...
I'm serious.
I can't take it.
You have actors in a room, right?
And instead of having an act independently of each other,
they're all acting the extreme situations.
The extremes.
Like, super-understanding, boring, yeah.
But...
Then you have the moderate misunderstanding.
And then you have the extreme misunderstanding.
You have to make sense.
And you can kind of try to blend those together
to make a conversation, a full-on conversation,
without taking up too much scope.
You can just write one long train of dialogue
and have written from multiple intonations,
multiple degrees of misunderstanding, understanding.
What the hell?
It's like you got a fight.
You can't see that.
Hmm.
I think we're pretty dense.
I'll throw it out.
If I toss it.


# REC025.txt
So, the bearings mechanic or the little skull with the pointer inside of it, the two-way pointer?
Yeah.
So, what if he had something like that, but it was a little less 2D?
You know, I imagine that being the dodeck, right?
You have two sides being grabbed at once and then a third side influencing it
to a certain degree.
You have the oppositions of anxiety and anger, anxiety and aggression.
And you have the modifier of enmity, for example.
Leo?
What's up?
Does that make sense?
I was talking to you, too.
That's okay.
So, I'm falling asleep.
Yeah, same here, man.
We can talk, we can talk about that.
Or do you want to take an app?
I'm fucking exhausted.
Alright.


# REC026.txt
So you have these moments, there are sharp intense, anxious inducing or aggression
and flaring events in our daily lives, and in our pager, the calm moments are the moments
we should strive for, the calm moments of clear understanding and a lack of
misunderstanding, long anxiety, long aggression, aggression, when aggression, any
antithesis to that would be a breaking point, a breaking point in which they do
something they regret. I know that sounds strange to say, but if one were to believe,
or the lack thereof, belief in free will, it's like the lack of belief in a God it is
the culturally removed notion of that particular perspective, I guess.
And then you have the middle, that ties it all together. It's more like a gradient, and you
have an interweaving book, like I said, two interweaved books going back and forth back and forth
back, they're kind of folding into another, they're the behavior, social aspect, they're
all these variables, they're R2, R2, you know, you're going down tangents, right, and
you're going through each page, you're flipping into pages by holding R2 and looking through
more, holding L2, but sometimes letting go of the flipping, stop, just preventing the flipping
from proceeding. The ongoing procession of thought and allowing yourself to consider their
perspective of other people, and those around us, close, familiar and strange to a degree.
Imagine some strangers inherently negative in our society, but I think that it may have
gotten more negative over time, strangers like that man, he's a little lot, you know, as opposed
to that is the first a strange, you know, they're strangers, a strange as a negative connotation.
So, close-knit communities might perceive it, the odd people, right, it's a more polite way of
saying you're not average, but that's okay, we'll try to be understanding, and then there's the
step below that, not alone necessarily, but the extreme, trying to build a gradient, you got
to imagine who the paper works best, that's hard to convey.


# REC027.txt
Imagine a vertical cat tree maze, but it's modular, like a warframe tile set, and you have
little buzzers in each of these modular parts, and an app that lets you know where the
critter is, and you can kind of simulate movement through the structure, and help you're
in going to encourage your kid to hunt the prey, so to speak.
It has to be like, you have to be aware that if you're a large item, it can be too small,
you know, be realistic to their behavior, or shit, you can scatter them around the
apartment, kind of simulate the cat running from point to point, maybe like smaller nodes
throughout the apartment, to kind of point to thinking to fall all along, or shit.


# REC028.txt
Okay, so I know a nav mesh is a common usage, but I'd like to do it with the automatic process and do it manually.
I'd like to draw paths for these NPCs, but the paths, they can vary to some degree.
They can wander, they can look around, but they have to stay on that path pretty much.
But then the player themselves, when they have control over the AEI, they can go wherever they please.
It's like you're at one point, you're the maxi driver.
You're kind of like, you're engaging in the story, but you're also doing it in a way that's a lot better than traditional RPGs, or, you know, fuckin' Madame of Dan.
No, I'm a little more intro person, a little more social, a little less aggressive, a little less anxious.
People are bonding, and people are communal.
There is a term we came up with, Leo and I. I didn't note somewhere, I'm gonna find it.
Anyway, if it was a rambling, I hope I can make sense of it later.
Okay.

# retirement
job as well as any 25 year-old, but they all tell me "Mr. Kincaid, it's time to retire." "Mr. Kincaid, you should travel." "Mr. Kincaid, you should spend time with your family."

Well I don't want to do any of those things. I want to sit here and run this factory like I have been for years. 

This job will kill me. I am literally going to be bored to death, and it will be their fault.

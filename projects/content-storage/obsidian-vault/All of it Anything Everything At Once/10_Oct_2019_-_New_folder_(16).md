When you're working on flow focus on cadence


# REC002.txt
Consider how the game flow might change if I were to use the triggers to leap, to jump, to grab, instead of A and X.


# REC003.txt
Demonstration is seen where the player is running, using A, and then they use right trigger, left trigger, or both to jump the gap of a particular structure.
Either going down or going up, and then we hit the ground, they roll.
They roll by tapping B, I guess.


# REC004.txt
characters running a leap off a building and instead of this they're taking births.


# REC005.txt
So the character is running on the rooftop and they leap using right-trigger to grab on to whatever's in front of them.
And as they jump, a cat goes with them, jumps off, flips off without moving them to the other side.
It might be a bird or a rat me either, so I don't know, just kind of engage the player's eyes if you can interest it.

The only one that knows design well is you.
The only one that knows design well is you.
So design with your intent in mind.
Don't get influenced by this.
This early on.


# REC008.txt
Bedroom, 1 to 4 people, living room, 1 to 8 people, maybe 2 to 8, the local pub, 2 to 6 to 8, etc.
To apply, find the ideal occupancy for the scale of human room ranges.

Analyze the movement in Mad Max.
The video game.
Character movement.
Running.
The bracelet.
Find.
Running.
And a game.
Mechanical running.
And again.
That sounds good and satisfying to hear and look.
It's got to build up and speed too.

the gears of war in the system.


# REC011.txt
don't do a patreon and don't focus too much on twitter. Early access is the
biggest priority. Maybe a kickstarter. So we're doing a patreon. Patreon is too
milestone oriented and I want to focus on developing content well and if I feel
rushed to create milestones, I don't think the content will have the level of
polish in my needs. It's really stand out in the market.


# REC012.txt
So it's easy to record a live conversation and then give the player an interjection point.
Points to which we'll go back later and record tangents or questions or statements during a conversation the player can make using the R2-D2 slash fashion like system.

few mental notes. Does OBS Studio have an overlay?
And if so, replace the video screen capture, video capture with OBS Studio.

Is there a universal LG Magical mode?


# REC018.txt
So right out in the entirety of content for the main characters, that content is real
time, say 4 hours, 5 hours or 6, but the NPCs in the role you interact with, the NPCs
in the role you interact with have content that is only activated when talk to, that way
you are not increasing scope accidentally for every given day.


# REC019.txt
A content released would require a mandate or it would have one day of content in a time.
So you're slowly building out the main story using the characters, three characters to time,
and a given section of the story.


# REC020.txt
During a given day, give the player an opportunity, several opportunities to step away from the NPC and come back later.
Like you'll stick with them to talk to them, you know, climb with them, explore with them, walk with them, socialize with them.
But then at some point, they give you an opportunity to take a break and explore the streets, while they go off and do something.
Or busy. Or you plan to get together, get together later in the night. That kind of thing.


# REC021.txt
The Dodeque Web is like a progress meter for the players, the booties are locked, the
Dodeque Monks and their overall progression began.


# REC022.txt
Design document into phases, for example, phase one is conversation, phase two might be basic movement, phase three might be climbing, et cetera, et cetera.
At the Comer County's worked out.
How deeply do you want the player to express themselves to movement in conversation?

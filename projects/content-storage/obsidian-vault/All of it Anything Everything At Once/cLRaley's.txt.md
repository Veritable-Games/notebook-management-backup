All the labor of my life has made use of my hands; stocking merchandise, assembling computers, and using hand-operated tools to build components for EVs. My employers have held expectations for me to use my body at a certain capacity and I've worked hard to exceed those qualifications by improving the tools I've been afforded. 

My work and life experiences have also afforded me a great capacity for empathy among peers and strangers alike. No matter my internal mindset, I've always wanted the people I affect to feel better about the day ahead. I'm careful to moderate my expression and intonation when I speak. The manner in which I conduct myself reflects back on the store and I'll do my upmost to carry a cheerful demeanor and helpful attitude when I'm hard at work.

I'll go home happy myself when I feel I've contributed to someone's day in a positive way. When we've worked hard and made the lives of the people in our community that much better for our labor.

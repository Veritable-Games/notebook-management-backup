many of us would like to see ourselves give all we might to others. 
The life that's ahead of us is not entirely our choosing; the weird 
behaviors, labels ascribed, the feelings of shame we may never 
be helped to recognize; those interior withholdings which may 
keep us from bettering ourselves. We are self-forwarding and 
thus, self-amending.

I need say on hierarchy: "We order ourselves 
in reversal of the forward; first, we put ourselves out, 
then imagine that [we] are not wanted for (in a way), 
set regard of the action or expression that was given
though, this may be inhibited: you may not be seen
How we 'order' the self is cause of our best relations 
or: so-likely, how we widen distances between people. 

If you are to work through your problems, see that you must 
give soliloquy and have discourse in yourself apart from others. 
If we are to process life rightly, there are strange inhibitions that 
hold us from language. If we do not have another is is most 
[imperative] that we talk to ourselves. We will not find growth 
keeping to solace; maintaining our so-prescribed atomization 
through isolation and the [wrong] wanting for what we 'ought' 
to attain [for ourselves] and those we would hold regard of.

Values are difficult. The things that hold us to people. If you do 
not know my heart, you would not know my intent. I have strong
feelings on how I ought to go about setting myself aside in these writings. 

If have my own [philosophical proofs] of human drives; Nature 
has afforded us 'felt-insight' to each other. We see our relations 
to people and then reflect on ourselvesâ€”holding-to those 
internalized systems of comparison and contrast of others.

People and our shared understanding of another is what [may] 
bring us so close to love. It is difficult to say on each of the facets 
that would bring us the [incredible things] of shame to the self, 
regret of what others (may think or feel),
 
[11:43 AM]Glitch: I can't go on to 'at' everyone again. If this is valuable to you, please react or something. 
Say anything so that I may know I have taught well.
[10:21 AM]Fang: You may be long winded, yes, but I haven't read a statement that didn't come from the heart yet. But, saying you're unimportant, it's not wholly true. We're as important as we choose to be. We oft delude ourselves by what others who don't know us believe, but we all forge paths that influence others. If one, two, five people start to do something, with confidence, others will follow, simply by the nature of things. But all people are meant for a certain thing, certain role. Some are meant to help, some are meant to lead. Some, to dream, to design, to take care of things. There are many parts to a whole, and looking at yourself as but a lone thing.. It, quote, "misses the forest for the trees." We are meant to be with others, to forge bonds that will serve us and others.
[2:17 PM]Glitch: "We're as unimportant as we choose to be." 
"We often delude ourselves by what others who don't know us believe,[...]"  We must go on with confidence so others may follow.
@Fang: Beautiful writing, my dear friend. Goodness, oh my.
"There are many parts to a whole, and looking at yourself as but a lone thing.. It, quote, "misses the forest for the trees." We are meant to be with others, to forge bonds that will serve us and others. 
[5:34 PM]Glitch: @Fang To say again, and quote you more. I really love what you have writ. It's breathtaking. We can all only hope to bring out so much of our souls. I really cannot say it well enough. 
[9:22 PM]Glitch: Affirmations of love go to language, my language is lacking.

The Process of Rhetoric: [Starting on Page 3]
A Human Problem
"You congressman is a public servant whose job it is to represent you in Washington." At least that's what your seventh-grade civics teachers, Miss Feeney, told you. Well, now it's time to exercise your rights and privileges as a voter and a citizen. Now you will sit down and write a letter to the Honorable Wilbur D. Fairweather, a congressman from the thitd congressional district. You'll tell him how you feel about a bill that will be coming up up for a vote soon, the Honey Import Act. This bill would abolish all import quotas and import duties on honey.

- After writing down the date and other niceties of the business letter that you learned in the tenth-grade English classes, you get down to the serious task of telling your comgressman what you think:

Dear Congressman Fairweather;
Vote Against the Honey Import Act.

Sincerely,
- John G Andrews [3]

- Somehow that letter seems too short, too abrupt. Maybe you should try a gentler approach. Maybe you should say, "Please vote against . . . " But that's not right either. You need to be forceful and say, "You'd better vote against . . ." There, that's telling him. But what if he doesn't vote against the bill? Or suppose he gets a letter saying, "You'd better vote for the Honey Import Act"?

- Although the Honey Import Act is a minor bill that probably doesn't affect or interest most of you, it does illustrate the basic problem of rhetoric: how can you get another person—in this case, the congressman—to do what you want him to do? Or, in a more general sense, how can a speaker (or writer) get his audience (the person to whom he's speaking or writing) to react as the speaker wants him to?
[5:55 PM]Glitch:
Our solution to the problem
- One way to answer this question is to turn the problem around and look at it from the point of view of the audience. Why should the audience choose to do one thing rather than another?

- Let's consider the possibility of Congressman Fairweather's position. First of all, Fairweather may be so strongly in favor of the bill that nothing could dissuade him from voting for it. He might, for instance, be an advocate of free trade, a dogmatist who believes that all import quotas and tariffs are wrong. If that's the case, he probably can't be persuaded to vote against the bill. On the other hand, Fairweather may be unalterably opposed to the bill. He may believe that American producers should be protected and supported with protective tariffs, or he may believe that bees perform a valuable service to farmers by pollinating crops as they gather honey—a service that needs to be encouraged with economic incentives such as higher prices for honey. If that's the case, nothing that you can say is likely to change his opinion. Or Fairweather may be [4] completely undecided. Perhaps he knows nothing about honey and its importance as a farm product. In this is case, the congressman might be open to almost any suggestion from the people he represents. Finally, and most likely, Fairweather's position may be somewhere in the middle. He is slightly in favor of our opposed to the bill, but he would change his stand if public opinion were strongly against him.

- We can represent Fairweather's possible opinions as a continuum from strong opposition (-5) to strong support (+5), as the figure below indicates: 
[image below] (edited)

[6:17 PM]Glitch:
As rhetoricians, we will assume that if Fairweather's opin- ions are in the range from -3 to +3 he can be influenced by what we have to say. For example, if you want the congressman to vote against the bill and if his position is one of mild opposition, say -2 on the scale, your letter may encourage him to stand firm in his opposition. If, however, he slightly favors the bill, your letter could influence him to reconsider his position, especially if quite a few other people write him letters opposing the bill. These are the possibilities-unless, of course, you have more exact infor- mation about your congressman's position on the issue.

Let's assume that you don't know your congressman's position on the Honey Import Act and that you want to send him a letter stating your position. How will you go about influencing him to vote your way?
[6:20 PM]Glitch:
One possible approach

Instead of answering this question directly, we could again turn things around and look at them from Con- gressman Fairweather's perspective. Let's look at some of the letters he might receive from his constituents. First, there are those letters that depend primarily on who the letter writer is. Here's one that the congressman

might receive:

Dear Wilbur,

I think you should vote against the Honey Import Act. By the way, be sure to wear a hat and galoshes in this weather.

Love,

Mom

Or here's a more realistic one that uses the same basic approach:

Dear Wilbur,

Since we've known each other since we were kids, I'll get right to the point. I'd sure appreciate it if you'd vote against the Honey Import Act. After all, what are friends for if they can't help each other out a bit? By the way, send my best to Effie and the kids.

Your friend,

Ed Brown

Both of these letters ask the congressman to vote against the bill solely on the basis of the writer's acquaintance with the congressman. Neither writer offers any inherent reasons why the congressman should vote against the bill. Now let's look at another letter that uses the same approach.

Dear Congressman Fairweather: As president of Thomas Valley Beekeepers' Association and on behalf of [6]
[6:22 PM]Glitch:
beekeepers throughout the state, I urge you to vote "no" to the Honey Import Act. We are counting on your vote.

Sincerely,

Erven J. O'Connor President of T.V.B.A.

Or let's look at another letter:

Dear Congressman Fairweather:

As a longtime supporter of yours and as a precinct captain in eastside Grovetown, I know that you'll do the right thing when the Honey Import Act comes up for a vote. I look forward to seeing your name and those of your colleagues from the rest of the state in overwhelming support of the Honey Import Act. Be sure to vote "aye."

Sincerely,

Elsie Mae Pfieffer

Put yourself in the place of Wilbur D. Fairweather, congressman. What effect are these letters likely to have on you? Is there any reason why you should pay much atten- tion to any one of these letters or to similar letters? What are the consequences of your vote?

As an experienced politician, Congressman Fairweather knows that his mom will still love him no matter which way he votes. He also knows that Ed Brown is an opportunist that his support may not be worth much. Thus, Fairweather who likes to flaunt his friendship with the congressman but probably won't be swayed by either letter. He can safely ignore both. "When the chips are down," he assures him- self, "Mom will vote for me."

However, Erven J. O'Connor and Elsie Mae Pfieffer are different matters. O'Connor, though only one person, is writing as president of a large organization. He cannot be considered just one man, but he must be reckoned with as a political force who may be able to encourage substantial numbers to vote either for or against Congressman Fair- weather. His plea will have to receive special attention. Mrs. [7]
[6:24 PM]Glitch:
Pfieffer, too, is not merely one voter with one vote. She is a campaign worker who raises political funds, organizes polit- ical rallies, and gets sympathetic voters out to the polls on election day. Moreover, as Fairweather realizes, he owes Elsie a favor after all the work that she has done for him. Thus, she deserves special treatment, too.

Exercises

1. Consider the different ways in which you could use your own character and qualities in presenting your- self to Congressman Fairweather. What specific role would you choose?

2. Write a brief paragraph to Congressman Fairweather on the Honey Import Act. Present yourself as one of the following: an angry consumer, an angry beekeeper, a young beekeeper who raises bees as a hobby, or a devotee of natural foods who lives primarily on honey and wheat germ.

Another approach

There are other letters that depend primarily on the information they convey to persuade Congressman Fair- weather how he should vote on the Honey Import Act. Such letters are often filled with statistics, "facts," and assertions about reality. These letters focus not on who is writing the letter but on what they have to say about reality. The writers are concerned with content-in this case, the effect that the Honey Import Act will have on the world (or

their little portion of it). Here is a sample of that approach:

Dear Congressman Fairweather:

The consumers of this country have been paying artificially high prices for [8]
[6:25 PM]Glitch:
honey far too long. By abolishing restrictions on the importation of honey, you will be putting honey within the budget of most families. As it is now, honey is too expensive for most families to use regularly. If you allow imports, the price will probably decline a good deal; at least that's what economists at the university have said. I urge you to vote for the Honey Import Act.

Sincerely,

James Nevins

Or the letter might look like this:

Dear Congressman Fairweather:

According to government statistics, wholesale prices have increased by about twelve percent in the last few years. Also, the price of gasoline has increased by twenty cents a gallon, and the minimum wage has jumped almost a dollar an hour. Under these conditions, a lot of farmers in this district will go broke if the Honey Import Act passes. Most of the farmers in this district had net incomes last year of only a few

thousand dollars. Many stay in business because of their added income from keeping bees. But if the price of honey goes any lower, a lot of us farmers won't be able to make a living. I ask you to support a decent standard of living for farmers by voting against the Honey Import Act.

Truly yours,

James K. Mullen

Both of these letters could help Congressman Fair- weather make a objectives-one to help consumers and one to help decision, for both have laudable farmers-and both contain plenty of useful information. Indeed, both letters are reasonable and well documented. Although Congressman Fairweather cannot support both positions, he now has some sound evidence on which to base his judgement. [9]
[6:27 PM]Glitch:
Exercises

1. Consider what other kinds of evidence-facts, statis- tics, arguments, or other material-a writer could use to persuade Congressman Fairweather how to vote. What kind of evidence would be most effective? How much evidence should he use, and how detailed should the presentation be?

2. List a few facts or bits of common information that you could use in writing a letter to Congressman Fairweather on this bill.

3. Using some of this material, compose a brief para- graph that you might include in a letter to Con- gressman Fairweather.

A third approach

There are letters which may rely on still another ap- proach to persuading Congressman Fairweather. These let- ters may attempt to appeal to his emotions. They could be as varied as all the different human emotions and as strong or as weak as any of our responses to various human situations. Let's look at one such letter:

Dear Congressman Fairweather:

I am partially disabled, and I have been unable to hold a full-time job for many years. I am the sole support of my widowed mother and six of my little brothers and sisters who are still at home. My mother suffers from arthritis and cannot work, and my little sister Sue is confined to a wheelchair since the horrible accident that crippled her poor little legs. It was the same accident that killed my brother Jim.

I scratch out a bare and miserable living for my whole family by raising bees. If the Honey Import Act passes. I'll go broke and we'll starve. I beg and pray that you'll vote against that accursed bill. 

Pleadingly yours,
- Everett Perry [10]
[6:28 PM]Glitch:
Mr. Perry's letter is designed to win sympathy through detailing his misfortunes. The writer hopes that Con- gressman Fairweather will feel sorry for him and seek to aid him by voting against the bill. The following letter appeals to quite a different emo-

tion:

Dear Fairweather:

If you want to get elected again, you'd better vote for the Honey Import Act. If you vote against it, you're through politically.

Yours sincerely.

Walter S. Brown

This letter appeals directly to one of our strongest emo- tions: fear. It threatens Congressman Fairweather by ap- pealing to one of the strongest fears a politician can have- the fear of being out of office, out of work, out of power. Here is another appeal to yet another emotion:

Dear Congressman Fairweather:

I know that you stand for America first and don't want to give everything away to foreigners and chiselers on welfare. Now it's time to stand up for America and the principles that made this country the greatest place on God's earth to live.

If you believe in America, vote against the Honey Import Act. We've got to watch out for Americans first.

Sincerely.

Sylvia Krown

This letter attempts to appeal to the congressman's sense of patriotism and, in the writer's eyes, to his sense of justice and fairness. [11]
[6:29 PM]Glitch:
Another letter might make the same point quite differ- ently:

Dear Congressman Fairweather:

Please vote against the Honey Import Act. That bill, if passed, would cost too many American beekeepers their livings and too many American farmers a decent margin of profit. We already have too many people without jobs and too many farmers going broke. Protect Americans first.

Sincerely.

Eunice Bamberger

If Congressman Fairweather is an emotional man, some of these letters may touch him deeply. For example, he may feel very sorry for Everett Perry, who seems to have some very heavy burdens. However, he also realizes that one man's predicament cannot determine national policy, espe- cially since he may receive in tomorrow's mail a letter from a crippled man who is supporting his widowed mother, ten brothers and sisters, twelve Korean orphans, and a cocker spaniel. Walter S. Brown's threatening letter, even though it appeals to the powerful emotion of fear, will probably be treated similarly. These emotional letters can be cancelled by similar appeals to opposite feelings. Thus, even though these letters may arouse the Congressman's emotions, they aren't likely to persuade him how to vote. They simply do not effectively relate the emotions they arouse to the issue at hand. (In fact, the threatening letter may backfire by arand ing Congressman Fairweather's anger against the writer and his position.)

The letters from Sylvia Krown and Eunice Bamberger are more effective because they attempt to relate the emo- tions to the congressman's actions. The Bamberger letter. which is probably the more effective, is still emotional, but the emotion seems justified. [12]
[6:30 PM]Glitch:
Exercises

1. Look at some ads in magazines for products like cigarettes, beer, liquor, automobiles, and cosmetics. Do they use emotional appeals? To what emotions do these ads appeal most frequently? Are these emotional appeals related to the natures of the products themselves, or are they simply directed at powerful human emotions?

2. What other emotional appeals besides those in the text might be effective with Congressman Fair- weather? Is the congressman more likely to respond to positive appeals (praise, encouragement, and so forth) or negative emotions (fear, threats, blame, and so forth)?

3. Write a brief opening paragraph to Fairweather in which you seek to arouse his emotions. [13]
[some really important text up next] (edited)
[6:33 PM]Glitch:
The Three Appeals

If you were Congressman Fairweather and you had no prior commitment to vote either way on the Honey Import Act, how would you vote on the bill? Which letter or letters would be most convincing to you? Which rhetorical method was most effective-that based on the identity of the writer, that based on appeals to the evidence in the case, or that based on your emotional response to the situation?

There is, of course, no right answer. Some of you will respond one way, some another way, and others still a third way. Any one of these approaches can be effective, a truth that was recognized by the Greek philosopher Aristotle about twenty-five centuries ago. Aristotle analyzed the rhetorical situation-any situation in which one person com- municates with another-as having three components: (1) a speaker (or writer), (2) an audience (or reader), and (3) a message (or content). Aristotle classified rhetorical means according to which element in the rhetorical situation was [13]
[6:34 PM]Glitch:
most prominent. Thus, if a speaker or writer emphasized his own character (ethos), Aristotle called this appeal the ethical appeal; if the speaker emphasized the emotions of the audience, he called this the emotional appeal; if the speaker emphasized the content (the actual truth about the subject), he called this the rational appeal. Which is really the best to use? Interestingly enough, Aristotle said that the rational approach was the ideal method for rhetoric, but he said that the ethical (or personal) appeal was the most effective. However, he spent much more effort on analyzing emotional appeals than he did on analyzing the other two appeals. So Aristotle couldn't seem to actually decide on an answer, any more than we can.

An objection and a response

Now some of you will probably object to this inconclu- siveness. You will argue that people are supposed to be rational, reasonable, and logical creatures. You may also think that appealing to someone's emotions is a way of deceiving him (as it often is in the real world). And you have probably been taught in your class (and in other books on writing) that logical writing is good and emotional writ- ing is bad. [14]
[6:35 PM]Glitch:
I will try to answer these objections as fairly and hon- estly as I can. First, rhetoric is the study of human com- munication as it is, not as it ought to be. Indeed, if people were computers or angels or just creatures of pure reason and logic, there would be no need for rhetoric. Pure logic would serve us all very well. But we all recognize that people have emotions as well as reason. Secondly, rhetoric does not exclude reason and logic. It merely recognizes that reason and logic are not always sufficient either to make a person respond as you wish him to or to get him to act as you wish him to. How many times have you argued about politics with your father and uncle? No matter how logical your arguments seem to be, they never change their opin ions. (They, too, are probably amazed at your failure to respond to their logic.) Thirdly, rhetoric recognizes that emotional appeals have their validity too. No one can prove [14]
[6:36 PM]Glitch:
with facts or logic that it is absolutely better for an Ameri- can to have a job than for a Saudi Arabian to have that job, but Americans are, in fact, more concerned about un- employment in America than in other countries. Such a bias is emotional, but quite natural and normal.

I should also point out that the ethical appeal, which is not strictly logical, is one that often works to our advantage. We trust the advice of parents, teachers, priests, ministers, lawyers, counselors, and friends-especially if we don't have any reasonable knowledge about the subject. For example, if a close friend says, "The movie at the Strand stinks," we will probably go to some other movie or to no movie at all. If a lawyer tells us, "Don't sign the contract; it's too full of loopholes," we probably won't sign. We trust the character of the speaker, even though we may not understand why. That's a normal part of living.

Rhetoric, then, is the study of how audiences are af- fected, whether by emotion, reason, or trust in the character of the speaker. Rhetoric (or a rhetorician, i.e., one skilled in rhetoric) evaluates a speech or a piece of writing according to how effectively a speaker or writer communicates certain opinions or information to an audience (either one person or a group) in a certain situation.

Standards of rhetorical
effectiveness

The explanation in the preceding paragraph seems clear enough, but it also seems pretty vague. How can we tell how anyone will respond to any appeals in any situa- tion? Isn't that just a hit-or-miss procedure in which we're more likely to miss than to hit? Or, to put the question more generally and abstractly, can there be any system to rhetoric when rhetoric deals with the whims of human personality? [15]
[6:37 PM]Glitch:
To answer that question, let's consider what may be a familiar situation for you and many other college students. Suppose you need fifty dollars for a weekend skiing or surfing or just having a blast. Don't you have a strategy for asking your parents for some money? Perhaps you write to your father at his office, or you may telephone your mother [...] [15]
[6:38 PM]Glitch:
when you know your father won't be home. Or perhaps you write to tell how hard you've been studying-something that's shown by the A's on your last three exams-and explain how you really need some relaxation. In other words, you do have a rhetorical strategy-a plan for senting your character and your case in the best possible pre- light for your audience.

Now this example of asking a parent for money is a money, money, good rhetorical model in the sense that the effectiveness of the rhetoric is pretty easy to judge. If you get your rhetoric has been effective; if you don't get the the your rhetoric has been ineffective. That's a pretty easy situation to evaluate.

However, it is not always so easy to judge the effective- ness of our rhetoric because our rhetorical goal is not always an action or an objective result. Often our goal in writing is not to get somebody to do something. We may want merely to explain something to someone, or we may want someone to sympathize with us. Or we may want our audience to think more carefully about our subject.

A work of rhetoric must be judged in relation to its purpose. A textbook is rhetorically effective if students learn from it; the book must contain accurate information and must present that information clearly and in a well- organized pattern. A letter of condolence is effective if it represents your emotions about the deceased while offering comfort to the bereaved. A poem is effective if its readers. whoever they might happen to be, enjoy the poem.
[6:39 PM]Glitch:
The standards of rhetorical effectiveness for a personal letter intended for a friend may differ from those for a poem intended for the public, present and to come. And the standards will differ for an ad that is intended to sell product and a letter that seeks to tell a close friend that you were thinking about him and that you care about him However, the ultimate standard of rhetoric is still the same you will want to know whether your message had the effect you wanted it to on your audience. That is the heart of rehtoric and the rhetorical method. 

As a matter of fact, you and I and those around us ha rhetoric and the rhetorical method. been practicing rhetoric for most of our lives. You've know [...] [16]
[6:40 PM]Glitch:
for a long time that you don't talk to the family minister the same way you talk to your kid sister, and you know that you don't deal with a college English professor the same way you deal with your mother. (A lot of you have probably already discovered-perhaps to your dismay that you can't deal with college professors in the same way that you dealt with high school teachers.) Because you've been prac- ticing rhetoric all your life, the formal study of rhetoric won't be too difficult for you. The chief difference will be that your study of rhetoric will now be more systematic and rigid. You will be asked to think more carefully and analyti- cally about your rhetorical decisions.

These few examples have probably been enough to show you that there is a method to rhetoric. Most of the rest of this book will deal with that method and how you can apply it to make your writing more effective. However, before doing anything else, let's get back to our original problem, Congressman Fairweather.

Deciding the Issue

How will Congressman Wilbur D. Fairweather vote on the Honey Import Act? How should he vote? What appeals will persuade him?

On most political issues we hope that right, truth, or justice will prevail. This normally means our own concep- tions of right, truth, and justice, for all of us are aware that others do not always see things as we see them. Indeed, one of the premises behind our Constitutional guarantees of free speech and a free press is that men of good will often disagree sharply on many fundamental issues. Thus, when James Nevins wrote and asked Fairweather to vote for the Honey Import Act, he did so because he felt that the bill would lower the price of honey. James Mullen also felt that passage of the bill would lower the price of honey, but Mr. Mullen did not see this as a good thing. He asked Con- gressman Fairweather to vote against the bill so that farmers would not go broke. [17]
[6:41 PM]Glitch:
Both men reasoned logically about the issue. Both agreed that passage of the act would lower the price of honey. But they did not agree on whether that result would be favorable or unfavorable. How would you decide?

One advantage of using the example of the Honey Import Act is that this is an issue on which few of us have any preconceived notions, feelings, or biases. If we talked about legalizing marijuana, granting federal funds for abor- tions, reinstituting the draft, increasing military spending, or deregulating petroleum prices, most of us might already have opinions on the subject that would interfere with our analysis of the rhetorical methods used in attempting to convince Congressman Fairweather. But in our hypothetical example there are few facts and no absolute truths. We have a case of what we might almost call "pure rhetoric." The basically opposite and equal rational arguments seem to nullify each other, unless we have strong biases towards either consumers as a group or farmers as a group. We're not sure which way of voting will ultimately help the district, the state, the country, and the world more.

The emotional appeals may rend our hearts, but these appeals are ineffective in themselves unless the writers can make valid connections between the emotions and the ac- tions they desire. Thus, an ad on television that merely makes you feel sorry for a starving child in Bangladesh is only partly effective; unless the ad prompts you to send money, it has failed (at least with you). As for the ethical appeals, they partially cancel each other out, too. They seem a little too weak, a little too underdeveloped to persuade us. They seem to lack substance.

An ideal rhetorician

What, then, will influence us (or a congressman like Fairweather)? Let's try to compose a letter that combines all three appeals in a successful balance. Let's write a letter that is rational yet emotional, presented by a writer who is attractive and credible. [18]
[6:42 PM]Glitch:
Dear Congressman Fairweather:

I have been pleased with your work for this district in Congress, especially your splendid efforts that resulted in the Spring Valley Flood Control Project. Because I know that you are anxious to make sound legislative decisions for your constituents, I thought I would pass along some informa- tion to you about the Honey Import Act. This information should help you to understand why I think you should vote for the bill.

First of all, passage of the bill will mean more honey for Americans, which will mean lower prices. Second, the lowering of trade barriers will allow the major honey exporting nations to increase their trade with the United States, thus allowing these nations to buy more American goods. This will help these nations as well as us. Buying honey from our neighbors in Mexico and Argentina will help these friends in Latin America.

I know that farmers will complain about the loss of revenue, but they can easily raise other crops, like wheat and soybeans, something that farmers in other nations cannot always do. The price of honey has been kept artificially high for too long, and the farmers have been the only group to benefit from this protective legislation. Besides, the fact that we are a honey exporting nation indicates that there is plenty of profit in honey, with or without artificial price supports. The interests of the general public should outweigh the loss of income to farmers, which will not be that great anyway.

Thus, I urge you to vote for the Honey Import Act. I am sure, however, that whatever decision you make will be in the best interests of the district, the nation, and the world.

Sincerely,

Shirley L. Greene [19]
[6:42 PM]Glitch:
Shirley Greene's letter should be an effective one be- cause she uses all three appeals effectively. She starts out by appealing to Congressman Fairweather's emotions. Specifi cally she praises him for his achievements and then appeals to his sense of duty and his sense of fairness. She character- izes him as a man trying to do his best, something that probably will make the congressman a receptive reader. Not only are Miss Greene's emotional appeals sound, but her ethical appeal is excellent. Her praise of Con- [...] [19]
[6:44 PM]Glitch:
gressman Fairweather indicates that she is knowledgeable about him and sympathetic toward him. Moreover, she appears helpful and reasonable. She is not simply telling the congressman how to vote, but she is giving him information on her position. As she puts it, she is trying to make him understand her position in a rational way. But she does make her stand clear.

Her second paragraph relies strongly on a rational ap- peal. It contains both facts and carefully reasoned argu- ments. Underlying the facts and arguments are basic as- sumptions about the welfare of the United States and its citizens. Ultimately-and the premise can neither be proved nor disproved-she implies that the congressman's chief concern should be for America. The argument is one of self-interest, one of the most emotionally compelling rea- sons for doing anything.

The third paragraph, which anticipates objections that some might have to the passage of the bill, is also largely rational. However, such a phrase as "artificially high for too long" has some strong emotional overtones.

The last paragraph again appeals to the congressman's emotions. It praises his judgment and indicates trust in him. In doing so, of course, Miss Greene's ethical appeal remains high. Moreover, she does manage to restate her position at the beginning of the paragraph.

All in all, it is impossible to say how Congressman Fairweather will vote. However, we do know that he is very likely to read this letter sympathetically. The letter does what it should. It presents the writer and her content to the audience in such a way that the audience will be sympathetic and able to understand what she is saying. What more can a letter do? [20] [...]
[6:45 PM]Glitch:
A review and a preview

As we have seen, "good writing" is not an absolute. A piece of writing is not good or bad in itself. Rather, its effectiveness is to be judged by how well it fits the rhetorical situation. The elements of this situation are the speaker, the reader, and the content. If the writer is aware of all three [20] [...]
[6:45 PM]Glitch:
elements, then his writing will skillfully control all three appeals: the ethical, the emotional, and the rational. Throughout this book, we will use these rhetorical stan- dards, not grammatical or literary standards, to judge how effectively a writer communicates.

Although the three appeals are normally intermixed and interrelated in any writing, the next three chapters will deal with the appeals separately so that you may develop both your skills in analysis and your skills in expression. Later, we will treat organization, sentences, words, and even grammar in a rhetorical perspective.

Things to Do

1. Write a letter to your congressman or senator on an issue that you feel strongly about. When you receive his reply to your letter, analyze the appeals that he uses in his letter.

2. Look at some ads on television or in magazines and

newspapers and analyze which appeals they em-

phasize.

3. Read the "Letters to the Editor" column in a newspa- per or magazine. Using your own intuitive responses as guides, evaluate the letters by putting them in numerical order, with 1 for the best, 2 for second best, and so forth. Then try to analyze the letters to see if you can discover the reasons for your re- sponses.

Writing Assignments

In doing any writing assignment, it might be a useful rhetorical exercise to list the following information at the beginning of your paper:

1. Subject

II. Audience (characteristics) [21]
[6:46 PM]Glitch:
III. Speaker (description) IV. Rhetorical goal

V. Rhetorical strategy

Here, for instance, is a simple plan for the first assignment below:

I. Subject-increase in state income tax

II. Audience-State Senator Jones, a conservative III. Speaker-a mildly angry but still reasonable citizen IV. Rhetorical goal-to get Senator Jones to vote

against the bill V. Rhetorical strategy-to show that budget cuts could be made to avoid this increased tax

1. Write a substantial letter on some controversial issue

CONTENT
Rhetorical Writing

The types of writing that this book will deal with will be the types that you, as an educated person, will be expected to use both in your classes and, more important, beyond the classroom. We will look at types of writing that you will use as employee, manager, college student, citizen in a democracy, and con- sumer. The major kinds of writing that you will probably be doing are persuasion and exposition. Persuasion is the attempt to change or strengthen an audience's opinion to agree with yours. For instance, you may want to persuade your boss that your plan for cutting costs in the shipping department is better than any of the other proposals that have been offered. Or you may want to persuade a politician, like Congressman Fairweather, to support your views. Exposi- tion is explaining or clarifying what something means or how it works. You may have to explain to your psychology professor what a term like defense mechanism means, or you may have to explain to a group of employees whom you supervise just how the new grievance procedure will work.

For both practical and theoretical reasons, this book will not concentrate on writing either imaginative literature- poems, novels, short stories, and plays-nor on those purely [...] [25]

things) or personal forms of writing that all of us manage to write pretty adequately-personal letters, diaries, love letters, and so forth. Nor will the book deal extensively with descriptive writing (word pictures of persons, places, or narrative writing (the telling of a series of events in story form). Although as rhetoricians we may use various tech- niques and devices from all of these forms of writing in support of our persuasion or exposition, the book will not emphasize them.

Rhetorical content

s of Because this book emphasizes exposition and persua sion, especially persuasion, you will see that certain kinds of content are more appropriate than others. Rhetoric has traditionally dealt with what Donald C. Bryant has called "the contingent"-those uncertainties in human affairs about which human beings disagree, debate, and argue. For instance, the Honey Import Act is one of those uncer- tainties. Because the effects of passing the bill are so dif- ficult to determine in any absolute and certain way, the subject is a proper one for rhetoric.

Among proper subjects for rhetoric are matters of the policy, matters of proposed future action like the Honey Import Act. When a writer urges a public official to vote for a bill, a citizen to vote for a candidate, or a consumer to buy a product, he is engaging in deliberative rhetoric, rhetoric about future action. A more extended form of deliberative rhetoric would be an extended essay in a magazine arguing that the United States should concentrate its resources on developing solar rather than nuclear energy. Or an editorial in a newspaper might argue that marijuana should be legalized or that the legal age for both drinking and voting

should be raised to thirty-one. The distinguishing marks of deliberative rhetoric are that it concerns the future and that it seeks actions from the audience rather than mere agreement. The language of [...] [27]
[8:14 PM]Glitch:
deliberative rhetoric often uses should or ought as key words. Another proper subject for rhetoric is past action-what

took place in the past. When jurors in a courtroom consider the evidence in a murder case, they are attempting to decide what took place in the past. As a matter of fact, the development of rhetoric in ancient Athens got great impetus from the need of citizens to defend themselves in court. Rhetoric that deals with judgements about the past is called judicial rhetoric or forensic rhetoric. Besides strictly legal matters, judicial rhetoric might consider whether Co- lumbus was the first European to come to America, whether Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in killing John F. Kennedy, or whether Shakespeare was a woman. Many historical and literary research articles and papers are examples of judicial rhetoric.

Unlike deliberative rhetoric, judicial rhetoric does not necessarily imply action. We can read a convincing argu- ment that Leif Ericson came to America before Columbus. but we are content with merely knowing this information. We have no great desire to do anything with the informa- tion. We feel no need to go out and desecrate statues of Columbus. Of course, some judicial judgements may lead to action, but the action is really separate from the judgement itself. [-] [27]
[8:17 PM]Glitch:
Whether subjects that deal with the present are a whole new class of subjects for rhetoric, or whether they are merely forms of deliberative and judicial rhetoric, is per- haps unclear. Nevertheless, we do argue such issues as whether the incumbent president is an effective leader, whether mental telepathy is a reality, whether life exists elsewhere in our universe, and whether our national de- fense is sufficiently strong. The judgement about the presi dent in our first example can only be made based on the past, so it might be considered judicial rhetoric. The judgement about the national defense probably points to policy decisions, so it might be considered deliberative. But questions about mental telepathy or life elsewhere in the universe are clearly about the present state of things and do not immediately imply any action. For want of a better term, we can call them subjects of theoretical rhetoric. The probabilities for or against the existence of life elsewhere in [...] [27]

>>> the universe can be argued intelligently until factual verifi- cation is possible.

You should not be too concerned about deciding whether something you are writing is an example of de liberative, judicial, or theoretical rhetoric. (I will say more about this in a later chapter.) What you should be sure of in a persuasive paper is that you are dealing with the contin- gent, with a subject on which there is disagreement and on which you can hope to persuade your audience. You would not argue an issue that is open to easy factual verification. For example, you would not set out to prove that the you United States has fifty states, that World War II ended in 1945, or other such easily verifiable facts. Nor would argue about scientific laws or other truths that are open to easy and accurate verification. Why argue about the velocity of falling objects or the number of legs a cat has when you can easily find the proper number? [...] [28]
[8:18 PM]Glitch:
Nor does rhetoric deal with matters of personal prefer- ence or taste. If you like vanilla milkshakes but don't like chocolate milkshakes, it is rhetorically impossible to prove to you that chocolate milkshakes taste better than vanilla shakes. Nor can rhetoric be used to prove that red is prettier than blue, that Paul Newman is handsomer than Steve McQueen, or that roses are prettier than carnations. Matters of taste may make pleasant conversation, but they are not fit subjects for rhetoric.

However, especially among experts, it may be profitable to debate whether the Mona Lisa is a greater painting than The Last Supper, whether T. S. Eliot is a greater poet than Walt Whitman, or whether Hamlet is Shakespeare's greatest play. Such arguments may be profitable if the participants agree on principles and criteria for judging works of art and literature. However, debate is futile if someone retreats into a subjective reaction: "I think Eliot's a greater poet because I like him better." A good book review will argue that a certain book is or is not worth reading, and it will give

reasons. That's worthwhile rhetoric. Of course, there are times when the truth is not in dispute, and you will have to write clear, precise, organized explanations of the material. That is good expository writing. [-] [28]

>>> Often, however, the line between exposition and per- suasion is not altogether clear. In presenting an idea in a clear and organized fashion you are, in effect, often subtly arguing that the idea is good one, one with which your audience should agree or which they should find useful. Whether or not that blurring of the distinction between the two is completely appropriate, it is true that good persua- sion and good exposition share many characteristics in writing: clear expression, clear organization, and support- ing details for main points. Good exposition is often as argumentative as persuasion in its structure and develop- ment. [29]

Content and Rationality

To say that the content of rhetoric is those subjects on which people disagree or on which they need to be en- lightened does not really narrow the field a lot. It does exclude some subjects, but it also includes a great range of topics from mathematics to politics to buying an automobile. Moreover, it seems clear that a writer can't prove that legalizing marijuana will benefit society as clearly as he can prove that the sum of the angles of a triangle equals one hundred eighty degrees. Similarly, a writer will probably have a more difficult time convincing an audience that his particular interpretation of a poem is correct than he will in convincing an audience that reducing speed limits on the highway will help reduce automobile accidents.

One reason for this, though not the only one, is that different subject matters yield different degrees of cer- tainty. Thus, in fields like mathematics and logic, one can construct an argument that follows so clearly step by step that one finds it impossible to disagree with. On the other hand, arguments about matters of politics, morals, and social values sometimes seem impossible to settle.

Nevertheless, almost any subject can be treated ration- ally. This means that a writer can choose to use material that is directly supportive of his content rather than relying [-] [29]
[8:24 PM]Glitch:
on material that appeals to the emotions of the audience or on the strength of his personality. For example, let's con- sider these two automobile ads:

Playaround-the car for excitement, adventure, escape. Be free and

wheel-loose in a sporty Playaround, the car that puts you where it's at.

She'll love it as much as you do. So Playaround and live a lot.

In these days of fuel shortages and high gasoline prices, Stasha is the car that gets you there and back dependably and economically. Its four- cylinder, eighty-horsepower engine delivers about thirty miles per gallon of regular gas. Its twenty-gallon tank means six hundred miles of trouble-free driving. And Stasha is still priced under $4,000. Stasha-the sensible car for sensible people. [30]
[8:24 PM]Glitch:
Even on a subject such as automobiles, which is likely to arouse many different responses from different people, we can see the basic difference between a rational appeal and a non-rational (though not necessarily irrational) appeal. The ad for Stasha is largely rational in that it makes specific claims about the automobile. The central claim is that Stasha is economical. As support for that claim, the ad describes the smallness of the engine, the expected fuel mileage, and the cost of the car. All of these supporting details are subject to verification. They can be checked and tested.

The ad for Playaround, on the other hand, is non- rational in that it makes no specific claims about the car itself. Rather it uses words like excitement, adventure, and so forth that appeal to the reader's desires and emotions. The Playaround, as its name suggests, is meant to appeal to a male reader's desire for adventure, especially sexual adven- ture. The next-to-last sentence even suggests that the car (and by implication the driver) will be attractive to some women. However, a reader is hard-pressed to find anything in this ad about the car itself. (If a reader bought a Stasha and its engine had two cylinders rather than the four that were advertised, she could probably sue the company and win her case; but a fellow would be laughed out of court if he tried to sue the makers of Playaround for a succession of dateless, dull Saturday nights.) [30]
[8:25 PM]Glitch:
Claims and support

Making a specific claim and supporting that claim with material that is relevant to the claim is the heart of the rational appeal. The claim should be a proposition or asser- tion, or at least convertible to the form of a proposition. A proposition is a declarative sentence, and it should contain only one main clause. In the declarative sentence, the predi- cate (the verb and complement) says something about the subject. Claims must be declarative sentences, statements. They cannot be questions, commands, or exclamations. Consider the following sentences:

1. Brazil is in South America.

2. Fly to Brazil now!

3. Sunny Brazil!

4. Is Brazil a coffee-growing nation?

5. Brazil is becoming politically freer as its economy devel- ops.

Only 1 and 5 are propositions. Both of them contain a subject and a predicate that makes a claim about the subject. Number 3 is not a proposition because it does not contain a verb. It could be converted to a proposition by adding a verb: "Brazil is sunny." Number 4 is a question, not a state- ment. Number 2 is a command, a set of directions, but it could be converted to a proposition: "You should fly to Brazil now." Of the two actual propositions, only 5 is the kind that is capable of rhetorical development. Number 1 is a bare fact, either true or false. But 5 makes a complex claim about the relationship between the economy and political freedom in Brazil. It is the kind of proposition that

needs support for its claim. In a later chapter you will learn specific ways and techniques for finding and developing supporting material for your claims. For now, though, it is enough that you know, in a general way, the difference between a rational and a non-rational appeal. You should be able to differ- entiate between rational and non-rational appeals in the [31]

It is apparent from letters that newspapers are receiving throughout Pennsylvania that many gas customers do not have a clear understanding of the Fuel Cost Adjustment (FCA) as part of their gas bills.

1. The FCA is a procedure, authorized by the Pennsylvania Public

Utility Commission (PUC), that enables gas utilities to recover the in- creased costs of the gas they have purchased from their suppliers. The increases or decreases in the costs are offset exactly by corresponding increases or decreases in the customer's gas bill. 

2. The FCA has been part of the customer's gas bill since 1969,

Recently the Legislature has requried that this element be listed separately.

This has created confusion because many customers think this is a new, added-on charge.

5. The FCA charges are not "authentic." They are based on data submitted to the Public Utility Commission which includes each supplier's name, the date, the amount, and the dollar impact of each supplier's increase.

6. The FCA is subject to a monthly review by the Audit Division af the PUC and to an extensive annual audit by the Commission.

7. The Fuel Cost Adjustment reflects the continuing increases in the cost of finding, producing and transporting gas. It now accounts for thos 33 percent of the total revenue of the Pennsylvania gas companies. Without it, they would face financial disaster. Assuming they could stay in bus ness, they would have to borrow enormous amounts of money at current interest rates-interest which eventually would be paid by the customers [32]

In light of recent events which caused the loss of six or seven members of the Erie police force one would believe that this would create an additional burden on the remaining officers in their efforts to provide police. protection for the citizens of Erie.

However, it appears that this cause for which we pay our taxes is forsaken for other devious pursuits such as hiding behind a fence at Bucyrus-Erie to entrap and harass the public in the guise of traffic safety enforcement.

It's not enough that I have to pay an unjust income tax to the city of Erie when I live outside the city limits and receive none of the services these taxes provide but I also have to be ripped off for $35 for going through the yellow at the traffic light. I vehemently protest these types of fines along with parking tickets that are deliberately perpetrated for the express purpose of filling the city treasury with funds to be used by thieving politicians to feather their own nests.

If the so called honorable mayor of Erie had an ounce of intelligence he'd realize that there are twenty-five traffic lights across 12th St. and that under the best conditions a driver will only catch five of these green. This simply means that thousands of drivers have to stop and start twenty times twice a day on their way to and from work resulting in the waste of hundreds of thousands of gallons of gasoline every year.

Our pompous leaders have no qualms about asking us to sacrifice during the energy crisis by turning our thermostats back, car pooling, busing, etc. But don't expect those dummies to have the simple foresight to synchronize the traffic lights with the speed limit to allow free-flowing traffic across town for the big savings in fuel consumption.

C.

There is a current tendency to call any field of study which deals with facts a science of one kind or other. Thus we speak loosely of the science of business, the science of politics, the science of psychology, and the science of law. Great strides are being made to systematize these subjects and to develop them as sciences. The stumbling block, of course, is that each one of these subjects is influenced by large measures of human actions. Happily or not, man has as yet been unable to observe in himself (or in his institutions) modes of behavior that are strictly reproducible.

Most of the phenomena and materials of nature appear to the human observer to be strictly reproducible. A 1-lb. weight delivers a given amount of energy if dropped from a height of 1 ft. Water freezes when its temperature drops to 32° F. Carbohydrates are oxidized in the tissues of animals to carbon dioxide and water. Because of such reproducibility, we speak of the study of nature as natural science.4

If you decided that A and C were examples of rational appeals and that B was not a rational appeal, you are correct. Let's look at them and see what the differences are.

Example A starts out to clear up a misunderstanding as the writer discusses his subject, the FCA, in a series of numbered, orderly paragraphs that stick right to the sub- ject. The writer doesn't go off on tangents and doesn't get emotional. His main assertion or claim comes as part of the last paragraph: charge the FCA is Although it might appear that this letter is expository because the writer is merely clarifying what the persuade not an arbitrary FCA is, actually the writer seems to be trying to [34]
[8:34 PM]Glitch:
people that the gas company's charges are both just and necessary. There is persuasion involved. The writers of the paragraphs from a chemistry text-

book (example C) are also doing two things: explaining what a natural science is and arguing that the word science truly belongs only to those studies which are reproducible. They offer specific examples, or facts, in their second paragraph to support their views. There is just a touch of emotion in some of the wording in the first paragraph, but the presentation is generally orderly and rational."

Example B is not a rational appeal. First, it is very difficult to determine what the writer's chief assertion is, though it seems to be something like this: "The traffic fine I received was unjust." The third and fourth paragraphs seem to indicate this, but the writing doesn't clearly state the point. Second, the writer spends a great deal of effort proving that numerous stoplights cause a waste of fuel. However, even if he is right, that doesn't prove that his fine was unjust. Third, the writer relies on emotional language and arguments to arouse the feelings of the audience. He argues that the real reason for traffic fines is not traffic safety but the greed of politicians, and he brings up the irrelevant issue of city income tax. The language he uses appeals to our unthinking emotional reactions to politicians: "consuming avarice," "entrap and harass," "thieving politi- cians," "dummies," and "gestapo." This letter to the editor is not a rational one.

Summary

In this chapter we have looked at the kinds of writing that normally involve rhetoric. We have seen that rhetoric deals with those subjects on which people disagree or on which they need clearer understanding. Such qualifications usually exclude factual material on which there is no dis- agreement and little to say, and matters of purely personal taste. Rhetoric is for those situations in which it is possible to [35]
[8:35 PM]Glitch:
persuade or enlighten an audience by supplying support. Rhetoric may deal with the past, the present, or the future.

Ideally, good rhetoric will consist of claims or proposi tions with support. If the support relates clearly and directly to the claim, we say that the appeal is the rational (or logical) appeal. If, however, the support doesn't relate to the claim or if the appeal relies chiefly on the persona, then the appeal is non-rational.

Since content is usually the chief reason for writing. will discuss in greater detail how to develop your content in a later chapter. [36]

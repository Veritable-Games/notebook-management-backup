	No one wants to see concept art (keep it minimal, and show the best stuff)
	Give the trailer high production value
	No one wants to read blogs
	NDA doesn't matter
	Press doesn't care unless you have something to show
	Why is this game worth making?
	Can this team make it?
	Don't pitch backstory (consider what might inspire someone to buy it)
	Don't explain standard game systems. Only important mechanics.
	Explain what the player does during gameplay
	Don't use realism as a way to excuse elements of design (in pitch)
	Make note of the obstacles. e.g. convincing AI will be challenging
	Pay for a few high quality concept art pieces to flesh out the world
	Make sure publisher can tell what's placeholder and what's not

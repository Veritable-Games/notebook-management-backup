we expend the end of the universe, everything is getting further and further away forever: and it is- compared, the universe will go dark one day. unless we see through the dark- seeking those greater insights to physics, stumbling on incredible findings along this unseen path.

we have found ourselves in an unseen path, on an unseen path. 

if we are winding towards and away from other galaxies and the supercluster will one day be alone among a vast ocean: stars going dim and dimmer until we've sheltered ourselves in the warm embrace of black holes, nests of space colonies wrapped in the fading tides of gravity, here for eons to come. 

we would one day see past the local group, past this distance of thought to be gone stars and galaxies and universes. there is a key to unlock so that we may see the full universe. we are decades, maybe centuries from this technology. it may be through AI that we find paths of insight that lead us to the conclusion of M-Theory, the brane-world: the matter of fact that our verse is but a blip among a vast ocean that we do not have sight or recognition of. we are sad today, torn that we would not see the rest of the universe or be lost to it forever. but there will come a moment in our deep history that we gain recognition of the technology (develop it) *find it* and see that this key in our knowledge of the 'M' not only abides by mathematical laws, too- but that it likewise describes the greater whole of the greater universe. The brane-world as a whole is what we need to see recognition of in our language. It is bigger than the verse. A common description in people's knowledge of the world here. They have this knowledge. build incredible technology to see a starry sky. the brane-world


To convey a much larger idea. A much broader whole. 

We would have the game world span far from the base of the tether itself. You are on a trolley, vast-distances from greater civilization. There are winding paths, almost naturalistic- that span in all directions to create a rooted beauty and naturated variation in what the world of dodec is. these vines are a return to what I had imagined before. this is how we would create something unique. you travel the vines on your tram, and wrap the entirety of the atlas tether. this game has perpetual ideas of scale??????? we have to show restraint though. bring it back, don't show everything at once.

"Trusting one's instincts, what do you mean? How do we know our own will?]

To trust one's [will] is to [almost act on instinct]: to feel as free as we are capable of feeling we would seek out and resolve to confidence in something we find to be rewarding. Trusting one's insticts refers to the process of listening to and relying on your intuitive feelings or gut reactions when making decisions or navigationg situations. These insticts can manifest as an immediate feeling, a subtle thought, or a deep sense of knowing something without needing logical proof or evidence. It's a [typical] type of of subconscious information processing based on your past experiences, learned knowledge, and inherent abilities. 

[what is interruption in this sense, if we hesitant in the otherwise desirable act of flow? If I am a model of a good person why is it that I may take in the way I do? why can I not engage as wholly as I ought to with the people that may seek good care of me? if I am to be here for them I cannot idle myself in the ways I used to. this text is too important, this time is far too wasted. I may enjoy life but I must seek out to better it before that moment of my own best will finds best fruition. these moments to labor I would have deep expectations for. the only way I may persist is to generate the most abundant thing with time I do not know how society would see best use of. if the people knew me, what would their expectations for my work be? If I am setting my own will to this?]

However, understanding and trusting your instincts can be quite challenging. Here are a few strategies:

1. Self-Awareness: This is the first step. Pay attention to your feelings and thoughts. Notice how you react in different situations. These reactions can provide clues about your insticts. 

[We may never sin again if we so choose: to say exactly that I would like to eat veggies and tofu and not eat meat again: to say that I would not seek out easy pleasure: to disdain the distractions from things that would keep my ear to the soul of the world. to isolate, to self-cement is to see oneself to useless things. I must be out and in the world to experience it]

2. Meditation and Mindfulness: These practices can help you clear your mind and become more attuned to your instincts. They promote a state of awareness that makes it easier to recognize and understand your intuitive feelings. 

3. Reflection: Reflecting on past experiences can help you identify times when you acted on instict, whether it led to a good outcome or not. This can help you understand how your instincts manifest and how accurate they are. 

[on reflection: on reflection do you see good reason to persist in this behavior: if the experience was bad, how would you prohibit yourself from repeating that instinct in the future?]

4. Experimentation: You can test your instincts in low-stakes situations to see how reliable they are. This could be as simple as guessing who's calling before you answer the phone or choosing a path at random while walking or driving and seeing where you end up.

5. Seeking Feedback: Others may be able to provide insights into your insticts, particularly if you're having trouble understanding them yourself. They can give you a different perspective and help you evaluate your intuition.

As for knowing your own will, this often involves deep introspection and self-exploration. You can start by examining your values, passions, and desires. Consider what makes you feel fulfilled, what you want to achive in life, and what you're willing to do to reach those goals. Your will represents your inner drive and motivation, your personal decisions, and your deterministation to achive your goals. It's a reflection of who you are and what you want out of life. 

Knowing your own will can take time and might change as you grow and have new experiences. It requires ongoing self-reflection, honesty with yourself, and a willingness to confront and understand your deeping feelings and desires. It can be helpful to engage in activities such as jounaling, mindfulness, or even working with a therapist or counselor to expore your will more deeply. 

[I do not like this text. To say that one ought to appeal to a figure of authority. To suggest that we may not see our own best will. The world does not see us to best sight of our souls: it does not enable all to do so well with equnimity. The idea that we are all lifted up according to our stature: to stand as equals at the behest of greater society's beneficient will] [to set oneself aside and say that the other would go first]

Remember, both instincsts and will are highly personal and can vary greatly from person to person. TRusting your instincts and understanding your own will are ongoing processses that require patience, self-awarenss, and self-acceptance.

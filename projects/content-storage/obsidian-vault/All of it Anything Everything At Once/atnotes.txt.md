I rather be dumb than arrogant. Arrogance goes in my misuse of this language often because I do not bring it to better context. To take all my writing and imagine it for a book would be difficult. Maybe that is the only way I give this form. I have to draw with my language. These generators are a barrier to my progression. I have all I would need.

You need to listen. It is so awful that we do not hear each other. This is why my nothing is so severe. I am only here for me and every moment I am not typing or acting towards my goals I am not moving myself well. I must stop trying to talk to people on these things and instead see that I act on them.

Chaos is scary for us. I am not doing well enough to convey myself to the things that would bring people best confidence in me. Every word must matter and every moment in my mind to reflect must hold purpose. I should always be aware but this thing of my language is rhetoricized to dis-utility. I am negating in how I say nothing, nothing with the text. How do you ask for help if you have not done enough to show their support. You must bring this to a damn close. Write with what you have and bring these things to some form.

Consolidate the technology and resources: discern what is useful and what is superflous. If I am doing anything it must be that the items I set to utility are best selected open-source and linux-based.

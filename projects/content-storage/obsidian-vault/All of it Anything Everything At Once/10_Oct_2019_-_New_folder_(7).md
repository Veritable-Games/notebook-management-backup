So an issue I've noticed a lot of games is that when NPC talks, they'll move their mouth, but the body doesn't move.


# REC002.txt
When most NPCs talk in games, their mouth moves typically, and their body moves in a minimal way.
Sometimes not at all. I think I like to see a wider range of human expressions using body language as a means of communication.
You know, like, I need to showcase it. I might record some examples.
I suppose some reference clips for communication. Stances, postures.


# REC003.txt
Someone will change their posture after they finish speaking, and this is just a
freeze of design
When it's your turn to speak they'll change posture
Or when you've spoken next they'll change posture I should say


# REC004.txt
use multiple audio cues to encourage exploration.
So in Borderlands 3 you have these radios that are ongoing
and the player discovers they can turn them off
by going up to a speaker and pressing E.
So using spatial audio, using the sense of sound,
they can navigate a space and find these speakers
as they climb a structure.
So imagine that, but there are also other techniques
like imagine you can see an artist painting above you.
Either someone commenting on their work or this year.
You see the magic of working on it and you're curious,
like can I go up there, can I talk to them?
And you can.
Another simpler way of doing this by painting.


# REC005.txt
So imagine you hear music playing somewhere in the world and you can find
where it is, find the artist, but they're high on the rooftops, they're off
somewhere in a corner. You can't quite see. Use realistic audio to kind of use
simulated audio to bounce it around in a more realistic way, kind of guiding the
player towards the source. It's going to take some effort.

3:22 PM]Glitch: This the thing I must so greatly to. The only thing that I think matters to your may be held recognition of me the long lost thing of 'I' on these discussions [...] This ⁠rhetoric channel is the best spot for me to speak on these most held values. The ones of recognition to me; and I so think that  this is why the things of philosophy do not often so speak on things which may be of use to us. I can say that these things of language and knowledge are not a novelty to me nor should they be to anyone else. The thing of best clarity among others is variety of speech and recognition of the linguistic goal this writing would go to. 

My thing of philosophy so ties to ⁠Unknown where I may try at less speaking to the abstract. More functional in my language. Here, my ideals are described in best clarity; though, please mind- much endures UNEDITED; and I will have to set these old writings against my best, most-present understanding of the text. I may do well to amend a thing or if it's so bad; remove the thing entirely 

I want to give us set proof for our right to life among all these much larger systems. There is confidence in me that suggests these ideas may give us a collective insight beyond what we already have in our own knowledge and the insights we have in this all shared human behavior. ||more to beliefs of our obligations to this thing of Nature and those would-be others we are so inherited to take care of. Greater understanding of what  we are. This thing of the human machine- our relational  purpose to 'the self' and so many others in our lives.

If I am to do anything with my time it is only these writings and the [functional desire to work] on ⁠Unknown. My own writing goes to this strange thesis in may ways, if I am to have any personal utility of language; though it should not have a name. It does in my mind's heart. The thing is 'systems of beneficence'; these greater relational and so important underpinnings of the human psychology and the still-incredible workings of our internal minds- then to our expressional relational abilities. To say more on the thing of language. If we are to say best we must see that the ones that we see of mind of are in clarity best recognition. 
[3:27 PM]Glitch:
To give soliloquies; sayings to oneself in the perceived isolation of one's mind is what I believe gives to those internalized thoughts that go unshared. Historied meaning of the word, speaks of its use in plays; wondering tonight in felt solitude. 

I think it's a unrecognized and potentially greatly beneficial tool that we must not see shame in. And it's my almost superstitious belief that these under-expressed wants of the mind which we do not seek to make externalized sense of; 

—So much we of which we set ourselves to withhold- gives weight to eventual damages in ways of neuroses or so resolved in mind to persist- migraines which pull us back and weigh against us. I need only to do research for my own enlightenment on these unknowings.

We have such great Fortune in our ability to recognize and give credence to those patterns which bring forth understanding- through ourselves and of others. Give weight to your own experiences and withholdings in life; I am but one philosopher in my beliefs he's incredible, though underutilized minds. You would do so well to give as best as you might yourself to. There are only unknown returns for your internalized self and those ideas you have so much potential to share with. 

If I am to give rightly, if I am to give with such passionate intent to do good, I must see others. I see that I must not give so heedlessly; I am so severely wanting to amend for wrongs of giving that have been committed in recent days- to forward amend those past misgivings which I had not comprehended.
 
[3:34 PM]Glitch: To a deeply valued friend, 

I think I must say on my own philosophies in life or else it goes without greatest potential benefit to others. —The ego holds weight to ourselves in way of comparison; then to want, greed, jealousy and the thing of much too regard for the self. 

The 'I' affords us momentum towards reconciliations of things so driven and unknown to us. To my own beliefs of what we have been given by literal evolution & so-Nature, the sheer overwhelming potential of this so unlikely of minds. We've such incredible unseen possibilities to do so well for others in everything we see good in.

Give all you can, give all you might yourself to, and it's through these externalized processes that go forthmay work for all of us in ways we may**have yet to fully see for ourselves.
 
[3:48 PM]Glitch: @LittleNorwegians to my own misgivings to you, [archived as a letter]
These texts go on to give back in ways I could only imagine return.

Regarding Seneca's history; 
[the strongmen of Rome and their correlation of our modern 'all-but' lawmen]
"During the civil wars that plagued the Roman state in the century before the fact that Seneca's strongmen [lawmen] inflicted proscription as a way to eliminate enemies. Someone who was 'prescribed'—that is, posted on a public may blacklist—could be killed by any citizen in exchange for a reward; as punishment ordained."

On proscription- 
The [controllers of Rome used this method to solidify their control in the wars following Julius Caesar's assassination."

On the thing of being a Cynic, to a well-regarding friend
"Cynic philosophers disdained money and 
went about in ragged cloaks, begging from
 passers-by." Britannica ref

Known for [their] "unconventional way of life as for its rejection of traditional social and political arrangements, professing instead a cosmopolitan utopia and communal anarchism. —Socrates is considered to be the founder of the movement. To [Uplift] social conventions; as a  way of returning [to what humans may have had at a point in our so-long history.

'prescription' as defined by Webster: the action of laying down authoritative rules or directions
these state goons have 'prescribed' death in a way not far removed from the ideals of ancient Rome

Of the economy. It seems we're born into inclinations of wanting; the wants given to us like a [tumorous] growth we have no control of. We're born, inherited to the traits that would arise in us a 0% chance that we would not want as others do. People are raised against the backdrop of those far removed from us; held to our minds, the imaginings of great wealth, the [thing of] money; to-get-, for ourselves that which we would [not otherwise] see ourselves to hold. 

In these historied expectations of the might of [people unknown to us] and what they ought to [have] for themselves; the fairy-tale false images of these idols painted into our minds; consequent to our ideals for what we should have for ourselves in turn. We only see the extant results of these past-efforts; been told stories of how these systems are deserving of our faith, like trust in a religion and what these state powers should be to us. All unto this faultily-built thing of congress, the senate, the house, and this [absurd] thing of 'absolute' power in the presidency. 

[this stuff is being moved, not deleted]

Of our historythat teaches us of the aspirations of all; the will to want so wholly for the things that we do not have—wronged ideals of how we ought to see ourselves to partners, in-permanence, in-exclusive solitude to each other in marriage; of the borned ideals of this thing; over hundreds of thousands of years, history unknown to us [such that half of our entire species had not been afforded abilities to write themselves into history] these crimes, severities that may have gone far against our [much more real] nature for each other.

[for ourselves] and our shared time; these economic drivers are not affording
our best potential for life. they set us in division of chasms unseen to us

[more to add before this thing is of any value to anyone]

the thing I removed; and would have difficulty attesting to in such absolutes
the greatest workings of the soul; the mind that [set value] and hold us to people
the thing of the brain that gives us autonomy; the [systems we've been afforded]
these shared blueprints [DNA], epigenetics: those workings of the deterministic
systems in human behavior. - as said; difficulties in the expression. but as I might

We must abide by a unwritten social contract in our work. That of trust and the expectation that no one ought to contribute more than they feel they should. Do not be more-obligate than another.
 
[4:09 PM]Glitch: If any of you would like a similar space to soliloquize
[...] I so wish it that you are mindful of your own potential, to fully-see your own, set  wanting at expression, the desire to do more for yourself, and so I hope-, for all others. I would love for you to seek sharing those ideas and best givings that would otherwise go unrecognized or to [go-so] unwillingly unfulfilled. May you see you to it that thisidea of you* is held dear within your heart of hearts and [...] give all know; and recognize your Fortuities in life. Give rightly credence to those experiences that may go unshared. Keep iterating your kindest expressions.*

I believe it's through the inner-workings and seldom- externalized processes of our minds  that we find most purpose and value in ourselves. It's often through our giving of the self that we so wantingly would love recognition of in others. I may have an ego, but it's in my best intent and [hope of hopes] in these soliloquized sharings of my limited self and experience, [that I wish to bring change; to my own ends, the good grace of whom may share my time.] 

Only know, I have nothing in life but to [give my own.]

in a bad letter to someone I meant to work with
We must put aside be selfish drivers and give to others as we may give to ourselves. I believe this thing may have great potential for good [should we do it rightly].
 
[5:14 PM]Glitch: [this text has been amended for future clarity]

So far lost to us is the beauty of fuller expression. 
No needs should so occupy our minds to inhibit the progress of our soul.

To talk to others of what bothers us. So prevailing are the problems of our lives and to plan for what we ought to do in our talks to others, is [to] soliloquize in another way [for] those that would hear us. 

What vocalizations came of prayer are of the same evolved needs we would have so sought out in times past. The telling of tales among our tribe; oration of learnings, experience and knowledge we'd been so wanting to give to others. To write things out soothes just as well. 

Talking to ourselves, though not always in so many coherent ways, is correlated in negation. Soliloquy is to ideate in a freedom; to solidify on our problems against our willful internal focus- to others, unknowable workings so-said that could not help others understand us.

We cannot choose to deafen our mind to the talking of those we hear and comprehend; we've no choice but to understand as we may; unless we have such incredible  focus on something we'd do; or be able to to tune to our minds to comparative, may-be likewise conversation.

What I see in my own incomplete schema of things- to make sense of this thinking; the trauma I find in many is the inability to share in our, would-be-forced -internalized  workings. Of great, further consequence to breakings of the mind; thus our relation to ourselves and those others that may have us

Severe migraines that come of [what I believe to be] expressive neglect. The small breakings we see in others, the misattributions of angers  within, and other, so-small to be unseen, idiosyncrasies that work against us; damage to our most repressed [want of life].
 
[5:22 PM]Glitch: [these schemas go on unresolved but a work-in progress; goal of a thesis or epistle] 
[5:02 AM]Glitch: On the thing of migraines; for some reason

I have formed a sort of argumentative proof on the affects 
of migraines; something I believe we've false attributed 
to smaller variables. I see how severe these pains may be in 
others, though, I do not experience them myself. To give [my
best] context and clarity for this [working[ proof, it would 
be of benefit to those that read this- that I go on to describe 
a few necessary terms and my own understanding of them. 

I need only to explain two terms for your best intake on this
[so important] topic; even if you do know them, [you may] 
still humor yourself. The words rhetoric and soliloquy; necessa
-ry to know for greater context, so that I may go further in ad-
ing weight to my abstract model here. I think that we've falsely 
attributed the causation of these mental, thus physical pains.

So, just these two terms,

Rhetoric, as I  [understood] it, is putting forth our best-felt knowledge and our fullest schemas. To convey information withheld in the mind to those we are talking to; best done when we are speaking out-of our greatest will. Rhetoric is sharing internalized models of the world with others. To be forthright about our own thoughts, and through them, seek-out the best under-standings in others. It's these suppositions of knowledge which go on to create our concepts of the world. To explain outward our best reasonings to someone.

Soliloquy, as I understand it, is giving forth that which is withheld in the mind, but different in-that it is explicitly expressed in [realized] solitude; to speak out-loud with our most heartfelt, expressive potential; advancing our most-realized speech, or moving ourselves through language of which we would otherwise keep internalized; talking to oneself in the most sincerest of ways. To externalize, or vocalize which is most unexpressed; [given best rhetoric and purpose], even despite our [may be] felt lack of company in the mo-ment of oration through the most literal thing of speaking. Doing this thing of soliloquy would let you hold mind to a crowd of people; listen, and tell more on what you know, thinking further to consequential feedback of others. Doing it in solitude; you may find epiphanies, insights, and mini revelations. 

[....]

The society we have been born into supposes that a person who speaks to themselves is crazy or somewhat maddened. Much of the 'soliloquy' we hear, is often partially withheld; full context  all but known to that of the speaker.

I see so strongly that we withhold ourselves from the greatest conveyance to others consequence to how this society has shaped us. To say further, I see the act (learned behavior) of prayer as a sort of soliloquy in its own right; to give expression to those most withheld those thoughts, which may, [in greatest potential], soothe the mind.

Of humanity's great telling of tales that were carried in speech over generations- we are orators by nature. We've such great ability to share ourselves through language. 

I believe we've misaligned our understandings of what it is the need to convey ourselves really proves to be. I see it as repression of our drives to communication. These incredible wants to give rhetoric and expression; further recognized as desire of emotional output and felt [acceptance] in others. 

Although we have weak attributions to what we suppose causes these internal pains, and such variation among our bodies and conditions, I believe it's these modern breakings that give hint to the so-often internalized damage that goes from our deepest retentions of the self. All to say, migraines are consequented by our unrecognized self-repression. 
[5:13 AM]Glitch: [...] 
[1:54 PM]Glitch: Please know, I have many Incomplete, incoherent, inane, very dumb arguments.
failings continue despite my best efforts to avoid them- these ideas are scattered

"Hasten your knowledge, doings; love & learnings; we've only this-" You are to die

Of all Nature’s drivers born-unto us
we are consequence of these internalized systems—everything which affects us; these 
[inherited] things of our shared relation and those values which force-us comparison. 
Where is there any order at all for [our] behavior to move, to take a step coming from?

We are self-amending; self-forwarding, not self-aware till we've reconciled with (the 
text going forward). Words do not withhold information unless they're given to function 
of context. I can say anything if I put myself forward to it; the idea of consciousness is 
false. We are not built to be self aware, we are built to be self-amending. 
[3:46 PM]Glitch: on pedagogy & related educational texts

[This book] makes appeals to the present idealized systems of education that would drive us to rigor in a hierarchical fashion. Incidental separation of knowledges; like the closing of a public library on the weekend, inaccessible to all those that may may enter it. If studies are kept to the solitude of this solitary library in those branches they would assume themselves to, even though the library is open; information withheld is still restricted in ways of current teaching. [rigor to way of isolated systems of learning]

Through conversation, and all those ways we would spend time talking to people; things of discourse, rhetoric; and those expected, but nigh-accepted difficulties of working life. And again to this thing of the metaphorical library; these institutions of learning, as we've set ourselves to trust in certification. It's just their nature that those with the library card cannot implicitly share knowledge. [these learnings are restricted to the literal thing] These thoughts go from the ⁠Unknown reference;

The author from this work I was reading said, 
"tenure makes claims about high school and education operates. The emotion notably, it argues that educational practice is deeply intertwined with personal and professional politics. Novice teachers and idealistic parents would like to think that their children's education are motivated primarily, if not exclusively, by pedagogical goals. 

"Tenure argues that this ideal is significantly undermined by the realities of school politics, personal conflicts, and social hearsay." [You could easily replace that word with the thing of hierarchy].

"[This system does] not offer solutions to these problems; rather, it suggests that education takes place not in the classroom alone, but in outgoing affinities and disparities in educational, social, and professional goals. [societal goals]"

I think much in the way of 'good teaching' is done with thorough conversation. 
We are not giving 'rhetoric' between our learnings; all the 'certifications' to then
uphold again the thing we've inherited between people. Society is not best-built.
We [should be] readily sharing our models of the world & systems of knowledge. 
[5:11 PM]Glitch: Okay, some text is bad. I've outright removed it. Projection goes to our detriment a lot and I'm having relational issues that affect it badly.
[2:35 AM]Glitch: Of distance and [the love] between those we would want to
hold so dear, trying to put internal thought to work it isn't nearly 
as effectual for me as it might be for others; in practice, I believe 
we may be a capable of yielding great function from our minds; 

much [of my own] mental utility goes to personal mechanisms; the thing 
of emotional work, and it's my [still] developing 'proof' that it's because of 
my own history that these things are missing in my drives of behavior. 

I cannot ask, I do not know how to 'ask' of another. Though 
I would want, I can do as I may to listen and hold recognition 
of what someone is saying; reflect on what I have thought on, 
and give heed to what anyone would say in any response to 
what's been said, expressed, felt, or still-remembered. 

[...]

[wanting of another in my mind; false expectations I had before ⁠milk-and-honey to my own severity]

If you role your eyes, that's fine. I believe this is so-part. of what it is drives me to nigh-indifferent disaffection to so many. [...]

To do ourselves, well, to maintain a level-head. To release ourselves of these great
consequential anxieties- we must ask of them as best we ought to feel; withholding
or leaving your ego so bereft of audacity; leaves voids in connections that may have
otherwise seen such strength; the density of these branching holdings to people. 
[2:44 AM]Glitch: @everyone well, if this is a thesis. and [a dumb] thing to get people interested in what I am doing,
[3:27 AM]Glitch: "knowledge shared-well is good rhetoric mixed with soliloquy"
[3:28 AM]Glitch: I'm applying this [thing] to the project, Autumn and then later applying it to my own stuff
[3:30 AM]Glitch:
**The idiot dumb ideas of intelligence
Intelligence is not something anyone has; knowledge, experience, and trauma goes a ways, but the mind works to do incredible things if we can develop and then maintain enough of relation to others among those others in our lives. There is a set-order in how we do things moment to moment; as in language, then it would reason that there are still such hierarchies of [relational-draws] between those people that are in our lives.**

to what we once were; still are beneath the surface-
If humanity once loved themselves to wholly, why would they have such a need for wealth and [now] wants for things of individualized gain? If we made such rapid progress; seeing that we are kept contented to ourselves in recognition of an ideal that is invisible to us, the [attainment] and acquisition of things and money are thus reliable.

To our traits of feeling and reason; related insights in how we ought to want for each other; whom we will love and the principled beginnings of those that would hold time to us—then these still others that would teach and educate.

But somehow this ideal of what we ought to [have] has become warped. If am to find for myself what society has taught me to expect in [having], do I set myself to the acquisition of money, maybe power of ones own; or the antithesis? If we do not have the ones we would want for, how is it that we might see the those we have? 

Of all those people in our lives, to the idea of [others]; we will find behaviors to relational hierarchy. The given thing of this systemized attention makes us regard ourselves first, then to others. We must see that others are first.

I do not believe many of us put ourselves to best [potential] in life; these dreams of ours, the things one may attribute to goals along life- this far off thing we would imagine ourselves to having. Many of us do well with our capacities for people; and so many fulfill those momentary necessitations of them. To all those that do unobligated or 'altruistic' good work; those jobs we would ascribe best benefit to society. The things of time so set to good use of our knowledge to see to the requisite wants to maintain, build, make; extract, assemble, reproduce- later to create. 

We do not put ourselves to best effort Difficulty here-

We say for ourselves that our work is good. All that we do is meant to bring us best gain for upkeep and enough for retaining of what we've 'got' for ourselves. Those who do good work for themselves; those cherished others, those people that keep us grounded to life. Then those literal things we would need for in way of work, thus larger, the economy and 'our' labor's valuation under the dollar, still those that see themselves over us. This was not written to assume that all work was in a category ofunfruitful labor. 

We work for gain of ourselves, for those family. We work to sustain our efforts among other people that set their own to the effort as well. We will always work to no end until we cannot. For time to 'good work' I mean, items of effort that would bring our souls to greatest beneficence in the thing. 

Our connection in reward to the dollar is doing us damage. For time to work that will set itself to time things; abstracted from people. Our wants, most variegated. To our most-incredible unmet needs as a society and as whole acts of nations. The thing our connection to wealth goes with debt- and its this thing of debt 'what we owe' that gives us removal from the things that would otherwise matter. Fortunes; all of our own. To have is to need for; though so variegated. To want is to take on: to remove from. We want what we need: we do not always give back what we would return. The thing of economy is theft of humanity's collective will.
 
[4:06 PM]Glitch:
That thing which prevents us most from giving; 
the thing that stands in opposition of what may 
be returned to us in beneficence; is the thing of 'I'. 

To say, 'I' want, more than they do. To say 'I' 
would need more than they might. We must set 
ourselves aside in order to be returned by those 
who would offer themselves [rightly]. 

If you do not receive a return from the one you 
have given; give better, give on, give all you may afford. — 

Act continually in Beneficence with 
such abundance that they could not do
you a fair return. Know that they will pay 
it forward to others if not themselves.

We have a great debt to the world that will so-forever go unpaid if we do not recognize it

people are not so [far-distant] that we could not find recognition in those next
to us in work- life-; these sights of what we ought to earn for ourselves are 'dis
-tractions' from the things we may do- for this idea of the self and those others.

"The thing that holds us back from giving is our own sense of self-interest. The idea that we want or need more than others. To truly make an impact, we must put aside our personal desires and focus on the needs of others.

Act in a way that demonstrates generosity and kindness, without expecting a direct return. Know that even if the recipient does not repay you directly, they may pay it forward to others.

We owe a debt to the world, and if we do not recognize this, it will never be paid. People are not so distant from us that we cannot find common ground and opportunities to help each other in our daily lives. These distractions of personal gain and self-interest only detract from the good we can do for others."
 
[4:58 PM]Glitch:
The truths of our nature are found in language. 
I would see that you recognize, that even despite 
these [working knowledges] thus fact now known 
to us.  All of the greatest, most-thorough studies 
would not stand to enlighten us on the things of 
our inheritance; those things of speech, soliloquy, 
internalization, relation, trust, and feeling.

If we are to be learned without the good graces of science, 
we must see to it that our language goes forward to amend 
that which was wronged. To imagine the worst of anything 
is to see not of the potential for good in anything. We must 
see to ourselves that this willful future is of greatest poten
-tial for those that remain here and those yet revealed to 
the world.

If [I] would teach you anything, it is this. All have reason to act 
on themselves; you must discover wants that go against the 
[demands] of the self. The life we have been so afforded by the 
chance will of Nature would be squandered if we only go to give 
for the thing of 'you' and not 'them'. See yourself as standing apart 
from this secret, withheld will of the self. 

To say onward so that these teachings are not lost 
to whom may read them. We are to recognize those 
drives that would make us ignorant to the wants of 
others. We must [then] see to the matter of those 
others 'first' before we attend to 'us'. If all would 
regard their neighbors as such the world would 
go on to begin anew. We must embrace the good will 
of others and see to it our wants are not misaligned 
to jealousy or greed.

"The essence of who we are can be understood through language. Despite all the knowledge we gain from science and other studies, they do not fully encompass the complexities of human emotions, relationships, trust, and self-reflection.

It's crucial that we strive to improve our language to accurately convey our experiences and thoughts. We should not only focus on our own desires, but also consider the wants and needs of others. This shift in perspective can lead to a better future for everyone.

If I could impart one lesson, it would be to act selflessly. Discover wants that go beyond personal interests. We have been gifted with life, and it would be a waste to only think of ourselves. It's important to recognize and overcome our own biases and greed, and to prioritize the good will of others.

It's crucial that these teachings are passed on to future generations. We must be mindful of the ways in which our actions may harm others and strive to put their needs first. If everyone acted with consideration for their neighbors, the world could be transformed for the better."
 
[11:23 PM]Glitch:
If we are to ‘amend unto acts’ of beneficence, and do-so rightly we must know ourselves and imagine a brighter future for humanity. We must see that we have a fuller concept on how these systems of knowledge, language, rhetoric, relation, soliloquy, and then the weird anomaly of song—all interrelate to bring beneficence forth. This so-supposed theory would give us ‘greatest benefit’; an incredible boon to those souls that are and  will be here.

All deserve education, financial stability, shelter, food, water, lavatories, electricity, the internet—if your mother would do nothing else but return love to you; and as love can only go out into the arms of others or into ourselves; we have an obligation to these ones that would bring us into the world [not withstanding, the ones that would abandon their child out of neglect, or give them to adoption without care; then to those still others that would end their life or the new life of their own blood.

Mothers of all kinds in society are owed maternity leave; shelter, all that they need to care for their children and so-themselves. You do not see the best will of a mother and you may not see how once ended-in financial separation from one in parentage or so-said care would be left in poverty to keep themselves above the financial leveler of society's needs in this strange expectation of marriage and- then to rent in 'how it would be so owed- two parents working.

we must see all that we are:

Strength of words comes from brevity of heart.

Have no doubt of another's shared humanity
We may only be so envious of the sinless soul

We may want for less; if degrowth is something you'd recognize. 
We do not live in 'great' societies. 
The thing of most-valued will to other people is lost to our time.

We've 'wasted' so much beneficence on the gods; of then, to ourselves. These [would-be] returns of good will; thrown asunder, lost into [our] oblivion. Relevations—incredible thanks, given loose; our greatest say-so to others.

Grace to the gods is saying-on beneficence to the self; so-held in prayer. Language that would return to us, instead goes unto our 'own' said-wills. Showing gratitude [to the gods] is good; but these thanks are not returned to us. Our most, deeply-shared graces are said to the sky; for [us] and not for others. Expressions of our withheld sin, spoken [to avert] the 'most-received' judgment.

Regret is [to not forward ourselves]; to rest our heels on deep holdings of shame. We may amend shame through acts of most-recognized
 renewal of one's time.

"What else would ground us to our values?"
"No one may compare themselves to God."
"Such good will, I am but shamed against the idea of these better values."

Of determinism
 the greatest workings of the soul; the mind that, I believe; holds us to people the thing of the brain that gives us autonomy; the systems that afford us behavior of our shared blueprints [DNA], epigenetics: those workings of the deterministic systems in human behavior.

"Are the steps you're taking yours? And what happens when you slow your pace?"
 
[8:55 PM]Glitch: "You need not rely on just yourself."

Trust goes with someone's relational distance. 
I think many of the difficulties with how [we] talk 
to people on these devices is that [we] will never
hold someone's most-present mind; 

The whole; all of us, those great people of now—
we must see; which we would only do better
see that we [can] recognize those far removed
from us; those to greatest relation, then to the
moment they would hold us to - give greatest
return to those that would hold you in regard
see that you recognize that those systems which
hold power over us; those great organizations that
would keep us in separation of purpose under,
the works and incredible efforts that give us pride
to the many ways we live our best wills for life,

[..] to do better we must only recognize that 
those far removed from us have wants unmet
if all's wants are made full we would not need
for the things we may so-set ourselves to have.
To see that we do well for the 'I' and that still
others would reflect on those they make such
bequests of time; see that you put yourself into
the forward, given mind to 'them' before thought
to 'you'. See that you put your own advantage aside
for the wanting will of others; we may amend it all.

"Reliance on oneself is not always the best approach. Trust is built through connections with others. One of the challenges with communication through technology is that we can't always reach the other person's full attention.

It's important to acknowledge those who are distant from us, those with the greatest impact on our lives. We should recognize the power systems and organizations that keep us separated and separate from our goals. Instead of focusing solely on our own wants and needs, we should put the wants and needs of others first. When we do this, we will find that we can make the world a better place and fulfill the wants of everyone."
 
[10:11 PM]Glitch: On the feeling of shared values in someone's interest; 

how 'investment' from a corporation does not make us valuable
see that you can remove yourself from the idea of economic 'value'
teachers have (the potential) for our society's greatest admiration,
but market systems and governance do not see that they have it]

[..]

To to see ourselves or others against 
[these] shared values that society 
holds us to is to have feelings of 
great division, segregation, shame, 
regret, isolation and depression. — 

Of variegated distance in our
separation; to people and oneself, 
the feeling of being removed 
from humanity's shared relation.

Of greater consequence to hierarchical 
separation in our behavior and further 
extends systems and organizations so
far above us, that they do not recognize
the damage and trauma they have 
wrought on so many of their fellows.

[...] removed from ⁠Unknown 

apart from other, weird ideas of 'having' in abundance or 'fulfilment'
to have in abundance is good, but we have enough
to be fulfilled goes with complexity; but I may say,
all of us are so capable of finding fulfilment
we do not have exacting will over our roles in life
but the idea of being forever-fulfilled because say,
you will die: how does that enable greatest fulfilment?
death is not the thing we would aspire to. it is not fulfilling
we must find fulfilment in life as we're living; not in 'later'
the thing of "not now", "soon", "another time may be"
I will do it before it is said to be due: now, not this second

I may have many idealistic goals and sheer audacity to write 
on the things I do, but this thing of writing and keeping another's 
mind to attention is just a thing we're born with; a forever-nascent 
talent that I would like to say on. —

If you find others of less intelligence, then you are so-misaligned 
to the themes I am meaning to present. Intelligence is a myth.

Humanity is but related by things of great communication; 
articulation through incredible feats of language; in-born 
abilities that are nigh-unaccessible to our greater behavi-
ors. If people are to conduct themselves in the way of great 
rhetoric and sharing of their own 'so-believed' knowledges, 
they are to find themselves to learning, [practice of 
what they know], doing self-soliloquy; and then on to having 
incredible, fulfilling conversations with everyone they know.

The work we are meant to put ourselves to is critical to the well-
being of our minds; those things of the soul that drive us to life 
and motion among others, then to the recognition of ourselves.

I seek a greater understanding of what we are as humanity; the 
wells of shared values we hold to; all of them inherited, deeply 
related to our beings as 'human'; and our much-nascent schema 
of life, our brains, the behaviors we hold, and greater relation to 
that life Nature's gifts us greater ties to.

I want to teach so many [others] on these unseen 
systems of inherited, but known insights to each 
other; the systems of our very-most behavior not 
put to words, —to the breakings we find among us, 
all those ideas of someone whose psyche has gone 
awry or 'dysfunctional' as categorized by our field
and academic leaders in psychological, sociological, 
and neurological research. We see things that go 
'wrong' in ourselves, and have not put a theory to 
the systems that keep us to 'admired' behavior. 

As to the Systems of Beneficence, thesis, 
philosophical-proof, sparse-letter thing. All 
that I write on and learn will go this greater 
goal of my own—to describe these incredible 
behavior-driven value-traits. I like to say, 
"The truths of our Nature are in our language." 
and that's oh-so true in how the things of 
poetry, philosophy, and those wonderous 
written knowledges we see ourselves to.
 
[5:42 PM]Glitch: This text is useful but removed of context;

I think we've an obligation to amend 
the utility of some words. to "over-say" 
is to detract from the motion of cont-
inuing someone's attention to focus. 

To say, "thank you, thanks, appreciate it" 
is more stimulating than saying "thanks, 
thanks, thanks. If I go on to amend and 
better asses the words being put forward; 
I [must] be careful in the ways it draws on
our hared affects of spatial attention.

To say on the thing of "sorry". If only to 
'amend' a thing of the past. [...] To say 
sorry is to detract from the present tense; 
thus giving weight to a brief reflection of 
the past. You may ask "Of what do you mean? 
or "Sorry for what?"; most-often, though indi
-vidually-dependent; you may only 'set-away' 
this detraction by saying "It is okay.", "Do not 
worry.", "You are fine.", "No, no.". Saying "sorry" 
is to [avoid] the thing that may have been said 
otherwise. To say "My bad", is to wipe away 
the debt before you've repaid it. [...]

The thing of "thanks". To readily amend the thing of our forward. 
To give unto that words that go forth and say on the things we 
may know. To give less focused thought to these worded things 
that would take away from other details we may only bring our-
selves onward to. There is no impulse to reflect back on the thing 
the antithesis would then implicitly suggest. The thing of saying 
"thanks, thank you, appreciate it; is to let the other hold in the 
mind what they'd done right. To give unto themselves again; not 
to 'detract' unto you. To say "Of much gratitude.", "Thank you so 
much.", I so appreciate this thing.". These are to forward our 
language of beneficence.

Then, falling back to expected greetings create difficulty in saying 
exactly what it is you meant to say. If we are to do well in holding 
each other to conversation, we must engage with clarity; ease of 
some terms of phrases can bring us to confusion or distance rela-
tion; because they come with expectations of what those common
sayings might imply. What we say [carries] an aversion to trope.

Many of our unseen behaviors reflect on 
the sensations of internal nervousness. 
If I am to ask on something, I must not 
refrain from using the same exacting 
language I would use in this writing

Words come with incredible connotations and so do these 
terms of phrases we fall back on for an understanding.

we should know-ourselves so capable
people have so much more potential
 and it will take us generations to fix
these 'allowed' methods. Knowledge,
we're all so capable to it. The system
as we've so-seen it was not built for 
humanity's abilities keep to growing

[...]

regarding control of territory for extraction of oil
escalating the tit for tat response to justify taking
we've allowed it; to indifference- ignorance of what is 
why [we] would need from the world in such abundance

[to these unimaginable takings from others so far removed]
[of this incredible thing of wealth we've reaped from others]

these nighlistic debts unto the world that hold them in owing
to abstract takings of the economies; colonists must return what
they have taken from the earth, Unto all the citizens these greater
econonmic systems have inflicted on people;

the United States, these federal systems of governance and our thus
consequential relation to the economy and its given-takings in great
abundance; [I did not meant to post this so early, but I've said my peace
I need to get back to transcribing the text]
 
[9:06 PM]Glitch: Of my beliefs in humanity's enduring betterment; though in its many difficulties,

The world would change overnight, we could give full hearts to all 
those go on without greatest love. To say onward, to love of life, to 
love of people, to all that I may still come to know. Of love to life, 
we must see to it that we are not all that we give to. Of love to 
others is paramount; to go forward and give unto them as if you had 
no day to part them forward on. Of love of people, know that others 
mean as well as for themselves as you do for you; see that our 
systems of giving on forward in the thing as so-described.

Give all, give all you can and we will stand beyond their wanting power for everything. 

To those systems of 'work' that go beyond our 
most-recognized want to live past the effort 
of "economic growth" or one's wanting for the
attainment for 'things'. [We] can only see our 
most to those others in life. [..]

The others [that would] have us
are all that would matter to our 
forwarding; the past is not ours 
to return to- and the thing of 
amendment may only go-on. If 
life ought to put us to anything 
it is of great regard to the other.

To the relinquishing of our ideas of wealth in greatest recognition of others. 

How is it we attain ourselves in life to everything but not everyone?

[...]

Of these incredible, violent, past & present takings; nigh unnamable
the great buildings of things we might see ourselves to each of 
the [needs] we set to our time to in our great societies'. Of all the 
next things that keep us to our most-wanted aspirations these 
needs [of growth] to build on what we have and see ourselves to 
those things that would set us apart [-] the many that find them
-selves to labels said-so with speech of [sickly] pitything we ought
to recognize as a crime; our statespeople due for severance from their work
or so much shame they could not bear recognition for themselves

To those presently impoverished from wealth taken from those 
before us; descendants of those enslaved: are consequently impo
-verished from wealth taken from their labor [...-] those of [wrong]
but (still-afforded; ) privilege that still stands
on these long-overdue, literal-thefts in history

These systems inherited to us have given unto themselves
incredible fortunes, so-amassed from the hands of those
others that put labor to them. -o child, no mother, no father, parent is to ever go 
hungry in [right] the united states is owing in reparations
for those of history to slavery||to the many still-others that 
we owe our collective social wealth to again to those  minds 
so Fortuned to the time to for self-improvement: the time 
we may afford ourselves in recognition of what we may do.

We must see these takings returned rightly then we may see ourselves to other work
To stand equal is to have hearth & home
To have value in yourself & your wanted work
To be abled to see-to those within your hearth
To have shelter in the way of your maintained home
To have access to all those needs of water, food, good-air
To have great bounties of fruit, grain, vegetables; protein

Of all the things we would need for ourselves in life and 
the thing of liberty. Things of nature; lavatories, showers, 
baths; and to the things of electricity, phones, now the 
internet; of greater interest, search-engines & Wikipedia.

We have to see to it that our value to people and time
the economy should not dictate humanity's best work

The fool would give himself to the imaginings of money, 
in great hordes of wealth; value to the acquisition of things. 
To save for the future is to withhold for the moment. 
[..] We ought- and rightly-so
To invest in people 
not 'us' 
not the aspirations of this thing of want.
 
[1:17 PM]Glitch: This, telling of a thing. 

The thing of life as we are "water and bone"; to nerve, posture, speech and standing. [..] This thing would be named the self, may be others. The thing of 'I' in way of the human. To which we are in Humanity, Nature herself, the cosmos 'disrelated. To our most-unseen and present-tense; deterministic strings. The thing of our greatest inheritance in the way of our bodies, our physiology, chemistry; the ways our physical growth are tied to these very biological things of DNA; RNA, the strange-new wonders of the epigenome. [To the many named of] Humanity- the oddity of what we are as Homo sapiens.

I want to find myself an understanding of these things. 
[..] These traits we widely trying at
our systems of learning to reconcile. These things of the most
dire need for understanding. [ref. to what these great workers
of the most-studiedsociological/psychological occupations]

- badly thought of things of our behavior
those items poorly reconciled or understood
ones we 'may' call damaged or hence-other, damaging
what trauma our society affects unto us by unknowing drivers

'I' believe all human works are to be shared as best we may. 
If value is all we have then we have an obligation to value 
people above all; people above every recognition of the 
attributions of time and effort we expect from others. 
Life goes on as it does and must. We are to see a future.

[...]

I've determined myself to projects. Learn that intelligence is a myth. "Knowledge shared-well is good rhetoric mixed with soliloquy."

No one would 'have' someone's
exacting theory of mind. if I am 
to be selfish; though I mean the
difference of [may be] wild dist-
ances. the 'I' must be returned
with an equal measure of trust

if we do not see ourselves to the
thing of good conversation, we'll
have no choice but to assume a
lot of our days; [instead] 

The thing of change goes past our eyes

I've my own greatest confidence
in what people are 
humans are so far removed from
this thing of most thing thing of a 
reliant form of life. To those still
others that would keep us to still
others; to great tribes of people
set around and among these all
but vanished bonfires to the gods

[difficulty- people's individualized value of "what's best"]

gave rise to the best of our shared
bonds; in this strange thing of our
relation to others, these behavioral
drives that set us to motion for
these still wanted-for people. And if
still those that would want not saying
of us: even still those others that may
not be abled to the thing of this right
we may recognize as human *expression
in the thing of speech. The US affords a
most-literal speak under the amendment
of our most enduring constitution. 

This thing again-related to my writing,
things of good trust among those so us;

beneficence 
best benefit of another;
to give forward in breath
of what may not be given
in return to us. 

"One may set upon their 
own to see on what we
think ourselves best to 
give. Should, and if, they
then see this was a good
boon for them; they go on:
if returned-again, the thing
of beneficence endures" 

This thing of debt; then-to over-gratitude and may
be wronged expectations of what another is to 'get'.

No one ought to see
they necessitate 
a return to us.
Return as you do

We must imagine- that those others which do not know us would want to see us well.

"Great teachings go with incredible unknowable sayings."
we will not recognize what insights may be shared unless they are expressed
[give further reason to what is put out and you will find many still-revelations]

[1:24 PM]Glitch: Severe edits to the second paragraph of this thing. I may want to start citing to suggest where these things are being amended. If you are to have continuing confidence in me I must see that this thing of language is so-readily afforded 'future-proofing' so that it reads well to others that may encounter it. — These ideas go best with a good deal of context and I have yet to compile a full thesis].

These things go on. "I do not want to salt your mind with things that may read unnecessary." Lots of this language goes to reason of a bigger system. An idea of relation to this would-be project, ⁠Unknown. [...] A lot of it goes on with incredible imperfection. I may only write on as I have and keep on amending the text. Ideas are best said again. And yet still again. This thing applies to knowledge, too. Say on it in another way and you will have that much more clarity in an insight.

[I have much re-reading to do myself before this is at all coherent]

I will have to start adding reference numbers though. We can start using this thing I haven't used—; threads on Discord. If you have more to say or great contention with something I've said; reply in any way you see fit. 

We can only go on to have better ideas said.

[regarding some removed text, said to a friend in fair context]

on this thing of public speaking I've been doing
So I've been practicing this thing of 'oration' in a public setting. Speaking as I might to a given body of text; [giving my own] insight[s] [during my reading] in way of rhetoric- [mixed through] as the text goes. 

to distinctions in our variable speaking output
I have the 'speaker' voice, my own literal voice; I can give listen to people around me and return on the feelings they might exhibit; small things- people may give good credit in way of snapping, things of partial or seen potential agreement- if one keeps reading with modest mind and good heart; 

difficulty, he says
the thing of public speaking can be done without difficulty. If I have my best knowledge in these things of value, I may speak truly to the text. I have had small discourse but none so incredible that they would give be different insights to the text. 

This book is something I will literally amend with a pencil- not so perfect a thing. 
But it's the very same text I have in ⁠Unknown; this book is so agreeable I 
find no contention past my given rhetoric. (though it needs much improvement) 

People listen, give weight in expression; (may be unsaid contention) but they all set themselves to move on with the day- and what's funny they will often listen for the end of an argument if they see value in it. Small inattentional things I pick up on as I go on to read the literal thing.

Give your best clarity in the dialogue and [your] 'best reason' in the rhetoric will come through.


Do not obey, do best. If this thing is a prison we've not so far set you to freedom of best work. we might amend things today but these systems of far-abstracted economies would keep us from best life. we ought to see our abundance widely and equitably shared, then to best sustainability and uplifting the whole of humanity; restoring and renewing the earth for those here and those still after us. we have too much and want for illcontrived things. people are the only thing that matters; then knowledge, play, the act of creation and good 'work' in ways that would matter to our souls and our community. the 'I' isn't important, but if you say, them then you- you would have all there is to know on what we are to other people. Give unto others before the 'I' and you will find return may only go forward.
 
[9:03 PM]Glitch: The message being conveyed here is that people need to focus on their needs rather than wants and set aside their personal interests for the betterment of society. The author believes that the current system of governance is flawed and that resources should be reallocated to help meet the basic needs of all citizens, such as education, healthcare, and employment. They also suggest that people should be more giving and focus less on personal wealth and growth. The author feels that the focus should be on investing in the people and their development, rather than in corporations and the military. The author believes that there is a need for more hope and unity among people, and that unions should play a more significant role in promoting social justice and equality.

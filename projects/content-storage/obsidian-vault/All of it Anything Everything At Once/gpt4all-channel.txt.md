GPT4All Chat is a locally-running AI chat application powered by the GPT4All-J Apache 2 Licensed chatbot. The model runs on your computers CPU, works without an internet connection and sends no chat data to external servers (unless you opt-in to have your chat data be used to improve future GPT4All models). It allows you to communicate with a large language model (LLM) to get helpful answers, insights, and suggestions. GPT4All Chat is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

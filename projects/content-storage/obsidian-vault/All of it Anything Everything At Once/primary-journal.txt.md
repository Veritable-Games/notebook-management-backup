2:46 PM]Glitch: I've never put this space to use, figure I ought to put something out there. mockEveryone I have so many friends on this server that I ought to reach out to more often. Your lives go on and I miss so much. Life's taken me so far and I can only see myself continuing to grow my relational abilities and going forward on projects as a means of expression. There are a great many things my life has taught me in recent years I feel you all may benefit from. My only saying on it here is it that I haven't always been afforded moments to talk to you all. There are so many friends I've missed out on and so many people that have gone without attention I would now be so willing to give. People are most important in my life overall, but the places we live, the ways we connect to each other, all of the systems that be, and how we've grown to err in such harmful ways. The damage we do to each other, the trauma shared by this pale blue dot. I believe that all of it, all of it is broken. This world is so far from the ideal I'm setting myself out to espouse through my works. The life we live is so very broken and the only way I know how to contribute to it being fixed is to create, to work towards my greatest potential for expression with those that share in my effort and time. mockDevelopers, mockEveryone It's my wholehearted belief that the works we set ourselves to contribute can matter the universe to us and to the people we share our lives with. What we create, what we do, how we spend our time; we've bonds to the other that propel us into the future, and I think it's the effort of a great many people that are making this world a better place. -- I will make amends and do so much more to keep you all in my life as soon as I have the span for such attention. For now I must work, the thing I want to set out to create will be all I need to move forward into the future myself. The job I'm at now will never set my brain alight, the act of creation is such a wonderous thing I have let myself go without. -- If I can say things that are succinct. People matter most. We've only got so much time to create. Life should afford us the time and resources to give enough attention to all who we love. Do well to make friends and your heart will only grow. Give and give until you cannot. Know that I love you best I can. I will enable myself to love even more. --- All said, I will be taking the time I have left past holiday to work, WORK, work, and work. Though, please, REACH OUT if you need me. I'll be away from home here in Nevada from the 14th until the 28th; will have my phone, maybe computer in the moments I have to reflect on projects. 
6:17 PM]Glitch: selfish is what I am
[6:17 PM]Glitch: my outwardness to be selfless is incredibly intentional. I've developed drivers that center my attention to people
[6:18 PM]Glitch: can I move myself to be selfless for the betterment of others and put myself aside?
[6:18 PM]Glitch: I have done so much wrong to people and I will never be able to fully amend for the loss of would be love.
[6:19 PM]Glitch: I   want  to give, like nothing else it is the thing that gives me hope for the future. The act, willingness, wanting severely so to give.
[7:42 PM]Glitch: people are my wanting in life
[8:09 PM]Glitch: mockEveryone I am so sorry for the ill-considered and terribly contrived message that was intended to find heart to you all before; I am far from prepared to engage you all like that. -- I only reach out once more like this because it is inwardly important to me that my motivation isn't lost to you all. People are my motivation to life, you all have meant so much to me in the time shared. -- It is a deep feeling that anyone, that you, as the person reading this, will not want for anything I am so compelling myself to make unless you have concise, clear expectations of what it is I want to build. No matter of my hope for the future or for people; for family, for friends. --- I've been pouring the only soul I have at my disposal to make sense of a wealth of tangentially related notes and ideas, and so many wonderful recent experiences towards life; into what I aspire myself to make into patterns of clear themes; feelings that have yet to translate to goals on production towards the game. ---- My writing, as it is now, only holds purpose to me; there are greater wants for this creative work I am only able to recognize on my own so I must work to clearly demonstrate the expectations for what it is this thing is supposed to be. -- I am putting forward these incredibly wild but interrelated ideas on a template given to me by Anarco; the doc has given me an outline to work towards and I can be nothing but thankful for his attentiveness to it and the consideration of others to search for an understanding in it. --- To only say one thing to explain recent happenings, I am putting myself to focus on a revived, shared, would-be project titled autumnMock and an old, previously commissioned on, long-tinkered and kept thougt to, dodecMock. In use to both, I am trying to make sense of an old, poorly-documented dialogue system I commissioned from mockMolgato that has relation to much of what I'm trying myself at. ---- I can only apologize for that everyone message once more and be thankful that I know so many of you personally. --  It is my active belief that I will be able to make this thing with whatever limited wit and time I've to afford it. I have gathered myself towards the act of creation; I've no doubts in my mind to our shared, human potential. -- To iterate, I am ashamed for such a thoughtless first message. I have so, very much more to consider before this would-be thing I want to make with friends finds groundedness and relation for you all. I see an incredible good in all the Earth brings to us and want more to recognize the need for imaginings on futures we can all find shared belief in. I am oh-so hopeful that you will come to seethe good in what I will aspire myself towards. developersMock I know I can contrive something worth your potential for greater creative time; it will take so much more effort from me, I am making progress. (edited)
[9:01 PM]Glitch: No one, not the mentors I aspire towards, not my oh-so-dear friends and family, not the people I've put my effort to work with and commissioned, not a single-living soul will see the potential for good in the thing I am so compelling myself to make until I've given it the time I've set aside for so long. --- I say this to you all, and I insist again, that this thing, the thing I most want to put myself towards in life; I want to build an experience mockAutumn , and another, mockDodecthat afford us teachings on altruism, life and love, unlike any other game before it. --- I believe in my greatest of hearts that I've discovered the right experience to give my all to these supposed acts of creation. -- And I've said it another way, but I could give my all to 100,000,000,000 friends and continue to love them all the more. I cannot do well-enough to explain, but I have a confidence in my greater understanding of people; feelings of such incredible empathy and love for those in my life; I am so much of what I've come to believe; everything I've learned for myself, ideals and ideals to the benefit of others that I could not fathom to explain but am aspiring myself to. -- I have so much love to give and I want nothing more than to give you all what nascent learnings I've attained for myself. There is so much potential in the world to give, I can only do so well to put my best intentions forth and make something tangible of this hopeful dream. 

[3:57 PM]Glitch: I'm not feeling it, whatever it is I'm feeling. I wanted to reach out to someone to get conversation going I guess? I'm not sure why I'm waiting to express; I should be looking at this notepad, journal thing the, weird entry design bible thing. I've so many notes to organize in there. I'm being stupid and distracting myself with this searching for a creed, code, or whatnot. Idiot, I'm an idiot. Remember that, bring yourself to work.
[3:59 PM]Glitch: I think I'm looking for affirmations of sorts from people. I have not received any of the imagined gratitude I had faulty expected for myself. Now I am searching for this same, nigh unconscious feeling of it in other people.

7:12 AM]Glitch: [So, my madness towards creation will be nigh understandable unless I try to explain the motivation towards it. There's been a lot going on in my life; I feel as if I am finding a voice and I could do well to explain a lot of the divers that have left me distracted and illcontented for so long. -- I have so far compelled myself to share so much in effort to other people, wasted, wasted so much time to myself. I am as insane as  we often find ourselves in  I recognize that people can  become so incredibly broken and I see the small but albeit broken systems that bring me closer to people and keep me to the strange and irrational absurdities to life; I am moving myself,  carrying  others of  times influence to me as  as though holding to mind the lives of each   people to life stand as  greater that  those supposed giants throughout history. I am moving myself into one of the drivers that brings us to life; ego-be-damned, I am to share   as we all compel ourselves to do for one another  the greatest we can give to people  contribution to greatest loves of life. I am compelling myself to write on and share one of the hopeful things we can put ourselves to; if so very fortunate of we to create; I  have such hope and love of people, I will forward motivate myself to  recognize that before us people are finding themselves for more  towards others and better to themselves.  The so-going, on-scribing history so forth and long past us; we've nothing but time to leave  all we can for  others in our life. The great potentiality,   our greatest yearnings for the soul to give out all we can to those we love.  I want, I am able to compell myself to bring out from works   standing of giants  old and unrecognized to me,  so  much is a remix  and the things we create are built   shouldered to everything else, I can bring forth from my own experience,  and so shoulded greater  in mind to you all by comparison to anything history has afforded me to my ignorance.  I can only love for people  in my life and those that contend themselves with my time. I have such   illcontrived but  incredible, warm to wishing ways to life. If I am to believe anything in life, I belive that it's through our imaginings, love of people, love for all what life brings; I would love nothing more to contribute my all to give e weight to our most incredible love for a wounder, most meaningfully beatiful future  so  longed of our longpast-souls to   want for. I want to give something to help us imagine better futures.]
[7:19 AM]Glitch: [my contribution to us all in my work is done towards my hopes of  something far greater than me but so much greater for  the world. I think, though  my own   funnily broken schemas for   the understandings of people  are still so, surely  contrived themselves. illunderstood  people hold    such great  far, from my  most fullest-understood    needs and to my  most given experience, the needs and attributions of love I find from other people.] I left this in the dev-chat. not sure what I was going to make of it but I  finished  the thought   as I could bring myself to. 
[7:22 AM]Glitch: Tenant 1 - "If I am to I hold myself to purpose it ought to be holding dear of others"
[7:33 AM]Glitch: There's a key to getting   the right outlet for my brain but I tend not to recognize it.  I so want to share what I have to say with others but I  know there's   among other things not all I can do to bring them to my heart well enough. My dad,    the works of  Seneca   so  hopeful to myself   , the  affordances I have are wonderful and I have yet to recognize their potential   to help us. I am ego tripping to think I might help the world with my imaginings.
[7:41 AM]Glitch: there are strange workings of ego in this book that contest with my best   attention to   how they  word themselves. I cannot bring easy    or sufficient explanation of it to friends so I'm   using the outlet to find   some purpose to  the thought.
[8:54 AM]Glitch: I haven't recognized my own potential to bring forth ego to friends,  I have done  damage to  Leo of sorts  with something  I had written to him. Now it's with this writing here that I'm thinking to him.  I am  of   wanted great security in my friend.  There is something broken in my mind to   the potentiality for love in others.  Though I write with him  in mind, implicitly now,   and I should think to   how 'you' will read this, should you accept my invitation to something so insane. I have not-re-read what is written here. It scares me  so, but I believe that you could incredibly find heart in what I have written.  [It's so incredibly interesting, but I've misspelled beautiful   and now I want to edit it but I refuse. So important.]
[8:56 AM]Glitch: The thing. The hope, the dream I have set my deterministic mind to.  I  am still thinking to write to you, Leo. Unsure if  this writing would be  enough to amend things I cannot say  to your exacting presence  of mind.  Very interesting. I think it's incredible, these workings of the mind. So many thoughts to resolve if I press it against the ether of things  I've so set myself against.
[10:46 AM]Glitch: Tenant 2 - Pause a moment, take in such deep breath so that you may take in all that is in your awareness. Be mindful of the clear ice beneath your feet or you will slip against your standing; hold face to others and console their worries. 
[2:35 PM]Glitch: Tenant 3 - You only need to ask, so be it to yourself or to others.
[2:36 PM]Glitch: Tenant 4 - Tend more to see yourself and reflect on the presence of those around you; do all you may to recognize another's needs; see in them the greatest good of humanity 
[10:03 PM]Glitch: Left this horrible thing in the ⁠cat-preserve channel. (Okay, this block of my dumb process did not bring me closer to actually reading the dang text. I'll come back to the work as soon as I've eaten, maybe lose focus to a different work for a while. -- Seneca's stuff still comes back to me and I feel so much unexpected draw towards it.) Leaving this here because I don't want to lose it. If there's readings you all may glean from the limited information here, feel free to bring on your own rhetoric on it.)
[10:18 PM]Glitch: Tenant 5- It's that so joyous of work which we find ourselves in; those that are and have been so enabled  to that of our most  incredible drivers. In the works and our greatest of givings, we find in them contentment; awe to bring forth our bliss in creation. Of iteration, to amend and  correct for sake of clarity to others. Mind the death of said authors and know that you too will die. 
[10:29 PM]Glitch: Tenant 6 - Intent to others is what's most crucial.
[11:14 PM]Glitch: Tenant 7 - It's those that have, and are, affecting us to the greatest undertakings in our life;  time and  will shared is of all ours to behold.
[12:56 AM]Glitch: Tenant 8 - Find reason to give much more to others; seek to adhere the motive of your greatest actions to people; share the weight towards your dreams for life.
[2:30 AM]Glitch: I might espouse such incredible, idealistic thinking but then I cannot do well enough to move myself to work. It is unbecoming of me want to so greatly for others but so sinful to then be so terribly unable to create for the sake of others. [I see that I am] llcontented to rest the mind; I write towards feelings it goes un-abridged to [those] I am trying to bring closer to my most wanted understanding of the self and the world. 
[10:49 AM]Glitch: I have pulled some text from the description of a photo of Cthulhu. I believe it's seen as too needy against the would-be love of others. Strange to imagine those seeing my love of this cat as less-than, against the love of people. [...] "There were greater considerations I wanted for him in our use of [this transport], people gave thought to contest against his being  freely available to the floor   if people were around, though it was said to us so very late at night  with him wandering  to his  own freedom late last  night.  We walked together on the passenger car, all I put myself to his being enabled to walk around was that he  not go off into an area they had sectioned off for the night. Though, I felt comfortable letting him explore  when I felt he understood the boundaries, he  kept upstairs, away from the enclosed space.  I may be far to lower myself to the expectation he would not go down there, and may only suggest better affordance if more passengers would bring their own, likewise family. -- I was requested, to my admiration, though chagrin to one of [the train's] attendants , that we  were to  have him in a harness and confined to his carrier. [I did what I could let him wander again later with the harness woefully rigged to him.] Before a while he sat back again with me to  abide by my wanting to stay, though  later I could only imagine for his wanting to see more.  [We had good rest in the passenger car between  my  checking on his needs for use of the litter box I'd made up for him. [I've yet to attain the right box for it, but it was easy enough to attend to other needs presented for food and water.] Cthulhu had a good journey, though there were  better creature comforts for space I wish I could have afforded him.  I was instructed to have him to seats with such animosity. I was asked  twice without explanation; my asks and  the  welcoming  to him from a I made were ignored in the  poor rhetoric." 
[11:42 AM]Glitch: Tenant 9 - We are so limited by that given love from people 
[11:49 AM]Glitch: I have removed further text on my regard of Cthulhu. I see in myself the small atrocities committed in my withholding of his soul.
[11:49 AM]Glitch: "[to the pets] those whom we find such  great relation  for. Of history,  so divided are you all to my  friend  and not all yours, you'd think him more kindly if  you were to spend time  to his attention. It feels good and joyous to my heart for me to have you all see my love for him here, though the  form before was illcomposed and I am sorry for the iterations."
[3:14 PM]Glitch: This was taken from a message to dearest Dylan (Fang) I believe that I've greater amendments to make to my continually improving behavior; I feel that there is so much more to reconcile before I'd go as far to rely on software for illcontrived routines. 
[4:16 AM]Glitch: Tenant 10 - No greater wills preside over us. Do all you will to mind yourself to; all that which you hold dearest of heart. 
[4:16 AM]Glitch: Tenant 11 - The good fortune and thus- great suffering of all is only best understood by our searching and finding those [most truthful] of all our hidden drivers. 
[6:10 AM]Glitch: Tenant 12 - To repeat a work without then acknowledging our own withholdings; to deflect, outright object, or not give most word to those in discourse, is to our most-reduced- betterment. 
[5:18 PM]Glitch: Tenant 14 - Do not to get carried away in your own falsitities; give your best care of others and afford them to weight to listen. 
[3:48 PM]Glitch: Tenant 15 - broad strokes will take you nowhere if you can't imagine for yourself a path; give your greatest patience for your lack of knowledge. 
[6:31 PM]Glitch: It's odd when I can't yawn to satisfaction, though as tired and wanting for it as I am. I think it comes of a certain contentment.

[7:26 AM]Glitch: I've such a great ask of you, LN. Matters of design applicable to life.

To go greatly contest the severe expectations of what we ought to owe to work; those unseen and unheard consequences to society's deprivational violence. How can better share of broken systems of attainment between us.

I recognize that those presiding over us have no recognition in what it takes of. We need better amenable asks of our time; it's difficult to maintain a fairness in what we need of those that labor with us against the expectations of the company.

It's my belief and developing understanding that this work goes against our greatest wills to life. 

That the severity of consequence, as it stands, is of more detriment to ourselves than we could think to reconcile; a system so normalized that we couldn't think to amend it. 

So much wasted good will in their firing of my best of friends such wasted intent to work. Then this incredible, illcontrived notion of what it is we owe this organization.

If I see any way forward, it would be to abolish this system and replace it with something more equitable to the benefit of my coworkers and all those friends that I have shared time there with. To my dearest hearts of those we've lost to this broken system and how it neglects us. 

The system, what they so name it; occurrences, points, the arbitrary thresholds that [would-so] separate us from labor we may so otherwise want to keep. Unfair attitudes and incredible expectations of time and commitment that make no sense in understanding in the most honest wants of us to continue.

This system imposes indirect threats of violence that set us against the larger wills of society; should we [so be forced] from the work. There are actors in my company not so far removed that [set themselves] to these consequences with a button press. 

We may only suggest to abolish it and bring forth a more equitable replacement. In the place I work there would be no chance for unions or enough solidarity among the most-atomized of friends and those I've come to know- no chance for us to see to it that we [withhold our labor]. Where I work gives no chance of picket lines and the atomization of Americans give such slim hope solidarity for [in] change. I may only suggest a new system that holds [all of us] to greater heart [and trust]. -As it stands, the system [in place] is too severe against [our better wills].

I tried so hard to give weight to it in a long, drawn-out conversation with that supervisor; he lent me knowledge of so many of his most grieved of experiences. The company would not give him time to find hope again; so imposing their cold will without recompense or thought to the inhumane misgivings that this system puts on us. 

Being pointed out is all too easy if the worst of days comes to us or the most willful wants for escape arises.
[7:36 AM]Glitch: As it stands, this thing is inhumane. Giving us no recognition of what we may need to attend to or want of outside of work. My company contracts people at twice the expense they pay [us] until they see to it to hire us. Twice the expense to bring opportunities to people there. I see it as a needless waste to separate someone from the company so severely when those supposed bad days or greater expectations of life and our own wills prevents us to. 

All of it goes to time; the systems I'm so trying to imagine. Time as incentive, then so consequent. 

We need people, hands to the labor, but only so many new people hold themselves to it. My supervisor suggested at first that they should hold their own to themselves. And I believe that thinking is wrong. The gist of it, we came to a good understanding and what's to be made as alternative to the point system that exists. It would only take individual considerations; a developing trust in those we work with. I still can't suppose how to incentivize but it's my hope that if you understand the whole of these problems you may recognize a solution therein.

We cannot lose consequence, but we must create good incentive. And to my immediate thoughts it goes to distribution of time and asks of those able and willing to come work. It's my thinking that if we have a butt if we have an abundance of trusted hands will not need something so decisive acting against those with most wholehearted intent to work.

So, incentives of time. My supervisor brings to light the known potential of people not to care. And those acting in greater greed for their own hands without regard to those they give labor with. The thing I want to ideate on should afford better expectations of work. I need to put forward reasonable constraints they don't set such a incredible threshold against us. 

I wish I had a background and greater interest in mathematics or better game design chops so this would come forth much easier. I can only think to a few options for opposing pressures. Though it almost feels terrifying, for I don't want something that I am able to propose to bring so much harm like what came before it. 

I want to imagine keeping hold of everyone that works there for as long as they choose. Doing away with the points entirely. For the threat of loss of work and the graduating pressure trips us up. To my greatest hope, we would be able to come to work whenever we so need it. It's a fear of his my supervisor that people would abuse this, and in a way I know to happen. We can't trust all our coworkers will want to give equal weight to the labor they bring. So there needs to be either a great incentive or less severe consequence. Though the only two things I can think of as variables are wages. Then there is the fact that we may have an overabundance of people on a given shift. How might we incentivize some to leave to give room for others to work? It could be transplanting the guarantee of hours into the next month. Or temporaries of l I'm of wages. Though we all deserve a baseline of ours and earnings. Oh, this is so difficult. I only wish I knew better to how games wait variables so I could have design for the best incentives and most reasonable outcomes. A lot of it has to do with how much they're willing to give to work. Both in time and effort during the hours we labor. Suppose this, someone gives a lot of time and effort; we either guarantee them more hours or maybe raise their wage for a section of time; temporarily temporarily incentivize their continuation of work without holding over them severe separation. Hire so many hands and there will no doubt be enough to have labor from. So then goes the issue to incentivize extra people to leave. I am sorry for this wall of text and it for being so terribly contrived. I don't know how to best see it through that these systems are changed and our relation to the labor that holds us.
[7:36 AM]Glitch: Oh damn. I would suggest talking more to my supervisor outside of work to find conclusion in this, but he says he's not allowed to spend time with us in that way. I think you may still find difficulty in what I'm putting out. It was so easy to talk to him and negotiate what could be though I could not still think to a greater system. It hurts to imagine taking time away. Or being so withholding of it people are in incidental need. Suppose anyone can come in at any time. We could give them temporary bonuses to wage that resets in intervals; give more time and you get a temporary boon. Give less and the boon is reduced in that subsequent interval. Let those that work here come and go as they so choose; give as much as they are able, spend for their time better- so as long as we have enough hands I don't think we'll ever be lacking. I don't want to see so many that I have come to know be forced out by the company because life goes on without greatest regard of work.
[7:36 AM]Glitch: I may have to come back to this tomorrow. I am so sorry to leave you with so much for unrefined text. All I could think to do was ideate on this. I'm only that much closer to a solution. I so greatly need another mind to contribute. It's my hope that your knowledge of game design could bring to life gamification on incentives and then drawbacks to what people want and can output to the labor. Not being so severe the consequence if they cannot give as much as the company expects them to. Having enough hands to where we are never needing; but affording those that work with us the greatest freedom to life.
[7:36 AM]Glitch: It cost them double to hold a contractor. If we can bring everyone to full hire, they would save expense, and that I believe is part of the argument. But I couldn't put this to mathematics and how it's balanced. The shifts have available wages; more at night less in the day. If we were to receive raises in these intervals I could suppose that it would amount to a bonus at the end of the month or interval that works best. If each shift has a percentage bonus, variable to the expectation of what time is committed (and arbitrary in some ways). Let's suppose that more hours give yield to growth of those bonuses. Resetting an intervals as I said. So not to give permanent growth at greater cost to the company and further disparity of coworkers. The baseline should still have raises, likely depending on whatever system was implemented before, but I think it's through incentives of time given and the temporary boons in each interval that would give weight to people collectively giving enough time to the work. It would take a certain level of trust to see that every person is wanting of this. Even greater effort to see that they don't abuse something given so freely. The only disincentive in not coming to work would be that you lose on paid hours and that temporary boon.
[2:53 PM]Glitch: I'd like to form a thesis to music. How is it the intonation carries so much information information across to us. If you hear a conversation spoken a language that you do not know, would you be able to glean feeling from the words being expressed between the ones talking?
[2:54 PM]Glitch: Does it follow that music is an unintended reading of these abstract knowings of communication between other humans? It would give reason to the fact we feel emotion in our listening to it.
January 9, 2023
[2:20 AM]Glitch: I have breakings in ways of inhibitory externalizations; if I have no one to speak to in much of my day and find no greater contentment on my own, I will put out small wants of will that are overburdensome to others in my life. I see this now.
[2:54 AM]Glitch: [systemic governance] of the thing, how do I demonstrate further of the idea that the world we've so much fortune to drives us in deterministic ways? Of that in leadership, authority from other people in ways we could not do enough to recognize without content; authority that also goes to ideas of [obedience] and [ownership] of another. I do not know how to talk on these things and the text is very difficult. I own Cthulhu, in the way that I hold him to me; he not be so willing to ask on that which he may-so want. I want to give you all re-affirmations that I love [this cat]. (I think too technical and it's difficult to see my love through this text).
[2:58 AM]Glitch: [governance, accomplished through systems of continual debt; inhibitorily-organized governance which is taking too much of us; to the benefit of those so far removed from us that we do not know them]—those so holding of so much of what it is we value in our actions of [labor] in attainment of things, entertainment; misaligned affordances for other people, (money) and, if we can so afford it, the end of our time.] (edited)
January 10, 2023
[4:40 PM]Glitch: This one is terribly difficult. Soliloquy gives reason if we're able to communicate with one another. If I am to regard people that are far away, I set myself to thinking on them, not knowing what they may be thinking; not seeing enough that I myself am able to understand them, why does it go to follow that I cannot  'act' on myself in focus without knowing all of the others I keep attention to. 

I am unable to ask because I cannot give  to myself in a way. There are breakings that I do not understand. If I am to give forth what I know; apart from the innerworkings of my mind, I must set myself to write. [I should not have edited his text, it was most-me] (edited)
[4:46 PM]Glitch: This one is terribly, terribly, most-dreadfully difficult. 

Soliloquy can [function for missing discourse]. [These things unexpressed, not born-seen behaviors; though not systematically scribed into an explicit schema, these internal drives, tumblings, of behaviors to live, to action that goes forth, the externalizing of needs for ourselves, others] gives reason to [one another]; [we are to love as we ought to, we must recognize Nature's motions of unity to those of humanity]. 

If I am to regard people that are far away, I set myself to thinking on them, not knowing what they may be thinking; not seeing enough that I myself am able to understand them, why does it go to follow that I cannot  'act' on myself in focus without knowing all of the others I keep attention to.

I am unable to ask [and ask is a difficult word] because I cannot give  to myself in a way. There are breakings that I do not understand. [...] If I am to give forth what I know; apart from the innerworkings of my mind, I must set myself to write. The mind goes through discourse that gives reason to things, if we're able to go forth and continue to the mind of others. 

Our brains are forever linked to the empathic imagining of the other in our thoughts to the world. Of the strangest strawman, "What is empathy?" To have one's best idea of another in mind, to know that their intent and  [?] for life lets them keep going. Well, I couldn't find a word to it, reason goes forth. But it's determinism that sets our mind to motion. 

We're to understand on those in direct care to us; we will set [our abilities] to  see that's known of a person goes much to parasocial relationships, I believe. [Our abilities to empathize, to feel for another, to set ourselves to reason among one another. Humanity as we go forward  in union,  to the  so-incredible workings that move us to love of ourselves and one another. (edited)

7:05 PM]Glitch: This one is terribly, most-dreadfully; to the nth degree— difficult. Soliloquy can function for missing discourse. 

These things of our being- are unexpressed, born unseen to us, and the few may that set themselves to reason so well, those variable behaviors which drive us to life. 

These, not-so systematically scribed behaviors that form into inexplicit; though much explicit to Home sapiens' schema, these internal drives, tumblings, of behaviors to live, to action that goes forth, the externalizing of needs for ourselves, to suppose the need of others]; all the tinkers that go forth to filtering all that lies within our minds when we sleep.

 To love as we ought to, we must recognize our Natures's motions of solidarity to maintain everything-so-connected.

If I am to regard people that are far away, I set myself to thinking on them, not knowing what they may be thinking; not seeing enough that I myself am able to understand them, why does it go to follow that I cannot  'act' on myself in focus without knowing all of the others I keep attention to. I am unable to ask because I cannot give  to myself in a way. There are breakings that I do not understand. 

If I am to give forth what I know; apart from the innerworkings of my mind, I must set myself to write. The mind goes through discourse that gives reason to things, if we're able to go forth and continue to the mind of others. 

Our brains are forever linked to the empathic imagining of the other in our thoughts to the world. Of the strangest strawman, "What is empathy?" To have one's best idea of another in mind, to know that their intent and  [?] for life lets them keep going. Well, I couldn't find a word to it, reason goes forth. But it's determinism that sets our mind to motion. We're to understand on those in direct care to us. 

Our abilities of incredible behavior — the inherited functions that keep us in mind —  fictions that hold us to characters, the figures we hold to history, the myths fabled to us, parasocial relationships, the ideals of the self, the life that we have. Everything that holds us in relation to one another.]*. Everything we've been so born to. [Our abilities to empathize, to feel for another, to set ourselves to reason among one another. 

Humanity as we've no choice to go forward; the whole that we are, it is an imperative of the soul; to those among us abled to lengths for action for another's benefit,and so-against those who take all of our valuation of time, our ideals for prosperity; the so-enabled actions to love and to put ourselves to labor that sets our principles to action, of value to ourselves and to others. 

Be forever shamed, those that would only go forth to give only to themselves*. 

We must all we may do to give all we are to others; to give all we can until the thing we call humanity sets itself to work that would do us the greatest love.

[11:56 PM]Glitch: there are some workings of my mind that break in relation to [history]. this one, if I can say anything on my own dysfunctions to it, is unknowable to me still. I've to write to explore this  thing I know nothing of in a literal way, but also have much unreconciled behavioral relation to things in my past. [...] I might speak to it, but I think my [personal] history goes without importance. [...] (is that a [value] of my own; one so unconscious to me without a word?) Of the thing, though I know how my memories go on are not exacting; some may speak to theirs in such an incredible specificity and exactedness. elated to the time that I spend. May-be unintended or partially-deliberate ignorance of those days that pass.
[11:56 PM]Glitch: love, of love. I  have begun the path to love.
[11:56 PM]Glitch: why does uncertainty persist
[11:56 PM]Glitch: ?
[11:57 PM]Glitch: my arms are folded, I'm looking around. I saw Cthulhu and got back to work.
[11:58 PM]Glitch: I'm happy again because I got reassurance from a friend I'd expressed most-honestly to.

[12:03 AM]Glitch: of philosophy
[12:03 AM]Glitch: to say to another what you have learned; even though you may not know it to exacting re-expressiveness. to say with you know without repetition to the thing.
[12:03 AM]Glitch: AS LANGUAGE, GOOD LANGUAGE GOES
[12:04 AM]Glitch: these internal anxieties to another go without end
[12:09 AM]Glitch: lying is the thing we do not need
[1:19 AM]Glitch: False things on intelligence and standing
Intelligence is not something anyone has; knowledge, experience, and trauma goes a ways; but the mind works to do incredible things if we can [develop] enough of relation to ourselves among others in our lives. If there is a set [separation of order] in how we do things moment to moment; as in language, then it would reason that there are still such hierarchies of [relational-draws] that are afforded to those people that would-be in our lives. (edited)
[1:19 AM]Glitch: I have given myself to a lie
[1:19 AM]Glitch: a lie to help others better relate to this thing
[1:19 AM]Glitch: if I do not say for them to think on themselves, they will give too much
[1:19 AM]Glitch: but I must say that they ought to, or else they will not hold enough to themselves
[1:20 AM]Glitch: why is the word selfish so difficult???
[1:39 AM]Glitch: "I mean to say I'm proud of what I have now; though the work is different, I would so love to be able to match your abilities of art. — Distrust goes a ways, I can only feel wistful at the loss of the potential to work together again. Save travels, Eden." (edited)
[1:55 AM]Glitch: so much goes to learnings through language and so much goes into the drives of behavior, how is it, how is it that I am affected by my father's inclination to find order in things. Where is the impulse to pick up that damned bong and place it back in the middle of things coming from? 

Where is there any order at all for my behavior to move, to take a step. 

If I am to ask, and I've said this to myself a hundred thousand times, but if I am to ask. I need someone to talk to. Why cannot I ask of someone I would hold in regard, I cannot give enough. (edited)
[1:59 AM]Glitch: But fucking why?
[2:34 AM]Glitch: Hailey says she is a god. I think she's an idiot.
[2:34 AM]Glitch: why would I think that I would like to be praised?
[2:35 AM]Glitch: pride for what reason do we need to go forward on things; even despite [my own] betters? (edited)
[2:38 AM]Glitch: I love Omari but I do not know how to ask for his time. I    do not love  like I ought to. How am I ask of Vonnie tomorrow? I do not expect or even imagine anything of her.  It's incredibly difficult to say that I love [her-entirety] without knowing [who she is]. All I know of her is what she's done. How she's handled so much of her life. I gave and gave until I could not. I am of stress and my family  ought to worry; where do I stand if I have nothing? Where is this 'I' coming from all of a sudden? I have not had it comfortably in my language. It's incredible what "I" am able to do if I set myself to it. There are breakings of my mind still because I can not "SEE TO MYSELF".
[2:44 AM]Glitch: It's not just talking and "expressing" that we need.
[2:44 AM]Glitch: What is it to love something"
[2:45 AM]Glitch: I've known to want for someone that would ask of me. But what is it to love them so that you ask for their all? Why cannot I not love myself [I do love myself], but why is it that I cannot love another?
[2:47 AM]Glitch: [These] are systems of graciation through conversation to others and to ourselves. (edited)
[2:47 AM]Glitch: Mine are broken.
[2:48 AM]Glitch: So are so many others.
[2:59 AM]Glitch: all of it. I have a working theory; call it a philosophical theory, the theses thing. of all the tenets; the 16th needs amendment, I will never know hate others have; but of the 16th, maybe the 16.5th. 

On systems of beneficence; if I am to express love for others I must put myself forward to motion; of the systems we have [I have not felt the will of love in so long]. I cannot bring out the dearest of gratitudes for people. Most credit to Seneca for the term of beneficence and such expression for how we ought to incur gratitude.

Though I try as hard as I've expressed [and there are selfish drivers, internally; so do not believe the will despite loss or lack- internal drivers keep us from not depressing ourselves so much as to end the love for self] These Earthly drivers are systems of graciation by recourse of loss to self; much imposition of will through systems of higher stress to us; hierarchy at large and what we owe to the value-driven debts that are imposed. That bit was less philosophy and more 'what is' [in terms of the systems that order above us]. The Earthly drivers keep us grounded to people and set us to motion among our peers. 

Systems of graciation go further to maintain the bonds to people and allow us to [hold-strength] to ourselves. We must give pride to ourselves, hope to others, reassurance in acceptance. Such a word as Love goes with incredible difficulty, but if the drivers that make us, the thinly woven fabric of humanity has done done well enough to not unravel. (edited)
[12:33 PM]Glitch: Laws are values society ascribes to us. (edited)
January 13, 2023
[3:36 AM]Glitch: Back to Mordhau and this thing I haven't put a name to. How does one keep [i]power[/i] grounded? [Even supposed, often-unrecognized ignorance, aside] [i]If we are to give those most-generous a voice in it[/i], why is it to be done, and how would this idea fix the thing?
[5:57 AM]Glitch: are these drivers fixable? or [Are these Nature-ordained drivers fixable?] [...] The sequence[s] that follow to form our [all-but untrue] ideas of consciousness. We are self-amending; self-forwarding, not self-aware till we've reconciled with (the text going forward). Words do not withhold information unless they're given to function of context. I can say anything if I put myself forward to it; the idea of consciousness is false. We are not built to be self aware, we are built to be self-amending. 

If our ideas of [consciousness are broken], how is it that we would see to it that text is 'corrected' against our withheld deterministic; value-reflective, drivers? 

I think it follows [from my pooridiot reasoning] that these drivers may go on to clarify to themselves [on] things that [we] were already submitted; only-thus self-recognized in subsequent moments; [later-related to others]. (LN) It only follows, [that I; have to be sure nobody hates me, so I need to amend further; because this is immensely difficult text] Please, do see that you are well. Please know that if I knew your problems, that I could give as much as I might myself to—though my ignorance to the world and limited love from life [I] can only give outward enough to help who I am enabled to. 

If I could give you everything I would give you myself. But I must keep to this effort and explain. Please know that I care; this is difficult text to read, and you will find so much contention in my saying this wonderous thing. We are not self-aware or more present in a given-moment. It's the consequences of language that give us the falsely-contrived idea of consciousness.

This thing, language can only go forward. If we are to [recognize] ourselves in expression it's in these, all-but small, nigh-subdermal, almost unrecognizable ways; so much distracted from us, from those we ought to care for. If we are aware of ourselves, we can amend further than you may ever imagine possible. Reattribution of what's learned to the next moments that's passed. We  are [not] unique because we can [reconcile what's passed]. You must see (to the idea) that life may only go foward; amendments are not made by 'consciousness' but the awareness of what's being forwarded against past-recognition. As related beneficence [are these drivers] we are inherited by Nature in deterministic ways.

If I am to proclaim what this is to be. This thing, my dumbfuck idea of what it is to be to [each other] in our many variegated; —Nature-driven becomings done through the changes seen in spans of time unknown to us; we are Homo sapiens and those that would call us family are far-distanced by such incredible time. Not a theory of everything, but a theory of us. If I may say on my own accord for what this is to be. We ought to name it rightly for all that are not distinctly human; though of [this same] shared earth. I would ask whom may read; carry these knowledges on against the imagined will of [mine], through language, of people dear, to those so far. I would only ask of [those] all that may read- I am only to say it so as Systems of Beneficence. (edited)
[5:58 AM]Glitch: and I amended [recognize]

[7:28 AM]Glitch: A lost message, to Kree: "um, if you keep to the server I'll share what I may"
[7:43 AM]Glitch: I don't know how to reach those throughlines for [going through] small talk. People are too slow. (edited)
[7:55 AM]Glitch: people are too reactive
[7:55 AM]Glitch: people are too heedless of their own wants
[7:55 AM]Glitch: I am too heedless of mine
[7:57 AM]Glitch: okay, I can trust this text is private. I need to reflect on some of my past hedonistic behaviors. I would not to put words to it out of shame so I may try to abstract this. or totally distract from the issue. how does one write on their own vices? I would not put myself to such shame.
[7:57 AM]Glitch: interesting
[7:57 AM]Glitch: and terrifying
[8:25 AM]Glitch: I don't know who to to talk to. (anything I say may be too overwhelming for anyone) I can just listen to anything you would say on. (myself, [I] am too much, want of another)
[8:28 AM]Glitch: if the systems of operational hierarchy persist in our minds, we order ourselves in reversal of the forward; put ourself out, say we are not wanted (in a way), then put forward the thought (or action—though [this] may-be inhibited; the forwarding to ask of another is how we ground ourselves to eachother. If we set ourselves too far apart it goes to confusion, malice, distrust, and all the things that come with not understanding the 'other' that would endure against the will of our minds.
[6:49 PM]Glitch: gah, language and my own systemic confusion to the literal word 'I'
[10:39 PM]Glitch: Do people fear what people [systems] would want of them? Of the things that would tie them to their values? We 'fear' against our own knowledge in opposition to so many held values. (edited)
[10:41 PM]Glitch: If I feel my values are so-good, I will have no shame. So what is this feeling of depression?
January 14, 2023

2:39 AM]Glitch: Of our project dubbed ‘Autumn’:
If this [project] ends up as an inadvertent inclusion of my thesis, I would only be more-greatly indebted to your effort. As I go on though, we can [go on] to build Autumn. I’ve the ambition to see it as something that might help me say more on this odd philosophical proof; a working-hypothesis I’ve been writing out on the channel. People are capable of incredible things, and I think it’s through this project I may afford people an idea on how they may give better. 

Of Ego and original sin; the machinations of these values we are so ascribed at birth; of learned behaviors gained through facets of environment, nutrition, our-bodies; nurture from people, of attention, want for the self, of others that we would be-driven to know; Of Love and those that we would hold so readily in our minds; the distance of those many in our lives. Of all drivers related; we are consequently doing [amendments] of what goes [from these] internalized systems—everything which affects us; these [inherited] things of felt|shared relation and values which force-us comparison. Of Jealousy and ‘wanting’; these of our most selfish drivers endure to affect us; amend that which goes on to relate ourselves to others, all in ways that would hold us to the Ego and those enduring values. 

If we are to ‘amend unto acts’ of beneficience, and do-so rightly we [must-know] ourselves and [imagine] a brighter, wholly-optimistic idea of how these systems of knowledge, language, rhetoric, relation, soliloquy, and then the weird anomaly of song—we ought to know that [all life] operates on deterministic strings; we are not separate from that of Nature and the earth we’ve such boon of. If I am to espouse these values of ‘my own’; I am not but one. If any of you would take this to reflect on yourselves and impart these [supposed values].

I must say one thing; we ought to remove ourselves from need; these systems of graduating benefits and returns. The ones that go awry, break upon themselves; these are the ones that lead to the enduring social malaise. (edited)
[3:03 AM]Glitch: In sharing this document,
All of the writing here is not only meant to be used for Autumn, but in any project [we] may go-forward on. Those in the Veritable Game’s server; and (more-specifically) to those that [would-have] the explicit ‘developers’ role. If there are too many learnings to be shared in this development we should see to it that the ‘thing’ goes out freely.

My [own] project is still reserved until I have much more confidence in it. This stuff holds relation back to that thing of Dodec. If any of you find a shared ambition for what this game shapes up to be from all my writing, say-so and I’ll get you involved. I will do my damndest to describe this thing of [my thesis] and have it given back freely; no one will say that they own any single component, piece of art, writing, models, textures, engine-assets, audio, music, if any animations, interface and user experience design, and systems design.

[6:36 PM]Glitch: On remorse for the loss of love.
[11:05 PM]Glitch: I do not have a theory of self related to others. I could not imagine they would want of me.
[11:05 PM]Glitch: I do not know your wants I could not see that you need me.
[11:06 PM]Glitch: That you would have any attention for me.
[11:14 PM]Glitch: I can only ask of things I can only ask of what I cannot ask someone these breakings persist in so much not just my own
January 16, 2023
[9:45 AM]Glitch: Removed from the goddamn ⁠chat channel; WTF. (now that I am unimportant,  see to it that I am so fully dismantled in your  worst imaginings of such those awful, ego-driven souls; I am so strangely broken to the world, similarly selfish as we all are, but I likewise recognize the shared want of giving to those that make us whole, I am but one disconnected soul, you so many others  may be still greatly held in my mind. I only want you  to contest me)
[9:32 PM]Glitch: To those we would outcast or set apart relation to; the ones in most need, of best health, of all the ways we do violence on those behold to states, governances, and the so upheld 'law', we all see ourselves to. Of the ones most-cast aside, the ones we would find homeless; isolated, depressed, and traumatized. The ones who could not do well enough for themselves. Those ones who we may call 'they', the other; the deprived and neglected to hold themselves to most beneficent; of everything we might give, we must give ourselves. Of wasted labor which sequesters our minds into the shelves we've stowed them on, of all the ways we hold the mind to our own attention, to find that the 'I' is addressed. If 'I' am to give anything, I am to give myself. You must set aside the false imaginings of those souls separate from us. [...]We've taken so much from ourselves that we are poor.
[9:42 PM]Glitch: "To those we would outcast or set apart relation to; the ones in most need, [to those we wish] best health, of all the ways we do violence on those behold to states, governances, and the so upheld 'law', we all see ourselves to. [The systems that set us to separation] 

Of the ones most-cast aside, the ones we would find homeless; isolated, depressed, and traumatized. The ones who could not do well enough for themselves. Those ones who we may call 'they', the other; the deprived and neglected to hold themselves to most beneficent; of everything we might give, we must give ourselves. 

Of wasted labor which sequesters our minds into the shelves we've [so unwillingly] stowed them on, of all the ways we hold these brains of ours these behavioristic attentions; in all to find how the 'I' is addressed. If 'I' am to give anything, I am to give myself. You must set aside the false imaginings of those souls separate from us. [...] 

We've taken so much from ourselves that we are poor."
[9:43 PM]Glitch: I can pull a lot of the other writings together but there are still ignorances. So much more to say if we are to stand up to the many of us that would hold more to themselves.
[10:00 PM]Glitch: (saying as a straw-man again) What 'systems' are keeping us to a specific edifice? Ordinance of of government and the thing of law; we are to hold ourselves to each other and not to the imagined will of power above us. (edited)
[10:35 PM]Glitch: The most inane dumb idiotic strawman. "Why am I to have love?" To imagine holding [the] other(s) in relational proximity. Why is it that we have the expectation of a 'singular' other? (edited)
January 17, 2023
[6:55 PM]Glitch: the redistribution of 'wealth' that's happening with money is abhorrent. but what I'm seeing in myself is an inadvertent 'redistribution' of knowledge. I have so much at my finger tips; so much experience and time to ponder all I know, I have been given a thing the billionaires did not expect. Knowledge is of greatest beneficence to all of us. They do not hold absolute power. (edited)
[11:04 PM]Glitch: The only way the only way any of this will come to change is if 'I' can find people willing to help. These problems are too big, too complex, too far out of my reach to imagine making any amendment. I am alone in the effort so I understand people are trying. We are content in our problems and it is difficult to imagine giving ourselves to anyone else's.
[11:47 PM]Glitch: The system is so corrupt, so wholly broken that we cannot we cannot see past our own problems.
January 18, 2023
[2:33 PM]Glitch: We shouldn't [have] dedicated our civilizations to endless growth; the production of 'things' or the (wanted) acquisition of 'wealth' is causing neglect and trauma; to hold so many against their will and [uphold the economy]; which does so much undue damage—is inherently wrong.
[2:34 PM]Glitch: My header image is from a book titled 'ecocities', by Richard Register. 

It has a wealth of beneficent knowledge regarding how we might build better; to afford greater connection between people and all life—to create a renewed sense of relatedness through Nature in architecture.
[7:48 PM]Glitch: People are believing insanity. The abstraction of wealth is too much; our values way too tied to the thing. You couldn't imagine not having a desire for wealth. (edited)
January 20, 2023
[1:22 AM]Glitch: I don't know how to effect enough change on my own. It's difficult to engage people with this stuff. We are not used to longform writing and I cannot say enough on Twitter. I'm only thinking this now, Niki, but I think the thing of games is that are the best way of 'longform' engagement; past books, [film and media do not require you to engage, though you can get bored in a game and lose your focus in reading while the eyes pace and your mind wanders. 

I'll be implementing what people on the server want to share and building it with a few 'developers' and then a few friends that want to see it go on; and take whatever other literature picks up my groove for learning as I keep going with the writing and contributing what I can to the actual project. I have other friends more talented than me on every front. 

I'll be finding more perspectives as we make it. I want to weave a lot of how I feel about the world; seeing that our best shared perspective is written into the thing in how we tell stories that tell a lot on our very-odd condition. 

The discord is where I'm writing still, and I haven't [entirely] lost confidence in myself in doing this. I have many, many ignorances; it's overwhelming how much a few more books can lend you to perspective. I have a lot more to figure out before I can do anything incredible with my [unimportant] life. 

This game project, the thing I haven't been able to talk about- I haven't to anyone because it's so absurd in my mind. I have not been prepared to give you a readily accessible outline till recently.

I have a game design doc, a design bible as they call them. I'll write all these ideas into the thing in the way of folk tales; we have a good collection of references in ways of stories like I mentioned to you and I've just told another friend, the one I called to check on in my worry of

Ahem, the one I borrowed your phone for that day*, to ask the emergency hotline about the wellness check services; Samuel. [I really wish we knew why Chris made report to me to HR; maybe you'd have ideas?]

My friend, he lent me some poetry today and I've been exposed to so many unknown pains in them; to a kind of violence unknown to me, but all the same, things I have only shadowed recognition of. [The friend I'm working with, 'he's trans' and has only just today given me the time to listen; we had long conversations, and I got to tell him about myself. Do as I may to understand the greater picture, these works were consequential, and no doubt I've missed more.

If I had gone on longer without these readings, I would have missed nigh half of humanity's story. The friend gave me two books, 'milk and honey', and the other, 'home body', both my the same writer, rupi kaur. -- My friend says he wrote it with perspectives lended to him by women; poems of some nigh incredible trauma I only had the thinnest recognition of. 

I've to present anything immediately relatable, and so-learnable to people, I know I'm going to need to write on.
[1:22 AM]Glitch: Just write on and learn all I can 
that they are
[1:22 AM]Glitch: ;thing in how we tell stories [I want to tell modern fables, but new, much 'fuller', relatable ones. I have an idea to create better recognized reflections in characters [AI/NPCs]. -- At least; using this dusty old dialogue system I had commissioned, I'll be designing for 'real-to-relation' characters, them theming the core mechanics and writing to tie bring all of my working themes into this thing.
[1:22 AM]Glitch: themes themes
dang,
[1:32 AM]Glitch: The project, I told a friend the quick synopsis yesterday, "good social teaching and some hints of how we'll deal with authority" - the thing of Autumn and my own thing for relatedness, architecture, and how we might otherwise build; and amend, our cities for more available community.
[1:32 AM]Glitch: The only way to get rid of cars is to build better cities. The only way to bring people closer together is to have the same result.
[4:29 AM]Glitch: [I may not have enough to say on enough of this writing. We are optimized relationally for systemic repairs, brought on by behavioral epigenetics; seen to our dna structure that we are built out from the atoms, compounds, chemicals; all our stores of hydrogen and the abundance of these other formed things the biosphere share.
[5:36 AM]Glitch: If I am to see myself to others, I must put myself aside; see another in my most-felt way, give ear or say on, listen to give most heart in your response.
[5:49 AM]Glitch: It's through these Systems of Beneficence ~~I will work to finalize a proof worth all it's weight in the world's will to see [right] to each other. ~
[5:54 AM]Glitch: he thing of the other; the one we would see ourselves most to—he other you may call the 'one you love'; the far-varied beliefs in the person apart from ourselves that [we] would [so-believe] made us whole; the idealized separation in another self- in way of bonds of commitment in the thing of marriage and these endowed beliefs in our shared culture; the other that would be our own, the one we would love and call the [person] that we needed; the only other person we would need. The thing of the [solitary] other's most love being all we've need; the only one anyone could think they'd need to set themselves to. Of expectations to be married and 'get' married; to the affect of our shared-beliefs in what this [single] person is meant to be for us. 

Humanity has incredible systems of interrelation and it's my [working-thesis] that humans are so beholden to this thing; the thing, the value that so many of us would hold to our dearest, that thing I ought not to name, but may have to say on so severely. The thing, that this channel says on; but the thing of love. These recent works milk and honey; and home body are revealing to me in the ways our cultures have systemized ideals of what we ought to be for each other. The most-severe breakings of love go to— internalized repression; against the will of the one we would name spouse [so, -often wife]. 

The thing of love to another; a single other, to the crime of adulatory, to the unseen trauma which endures on all of those we would name girl, the ones we would love to our name, man-to the repressed woman.
[6:19 AM]Glitch: If I am to set myself to the writing on these most-cherished things; [I cannot rightly finish this text] (edited)
[6:24 AM]Glitch: Though I do not know of love because I am so severely removed from me it brings me things of pain; back onto the idea ;as affected by one so loving, they maintain so many woundings to the self reflected back unto the other, and through  abuse of silence; these behaviors to [haivng] another bring incredible damage to the other. — These internal withholdings of the self; they go to the severity of migraines & headaches
[6:52 AM]Glitch: So, I'm thinking I might just make this discord the Design Bible. I'll get an outline organized on a dedicated channel, but I think that this server may yield us better shared potential than something removed from immediate interaction. 

This platform and resource
Discord, this incredible tool
I see severity in it not being 
'searchable' via the public internet;

[5:59 PM]Glitch: We are not built different or better than any other kind. Of all the forms that hold to life here on Nature's earth, we are to see another and go on to recognize these rights to independence of oneself to the 'I' those others we would call the ones of family, coworkers, friends, teachers, mentors, and those most more in value to our hearts. If we are to do ourselves [rightly], we ought to see to that, when we act in another's part of mind, we might will ourselves to see if as forth; 'them, then you'; in our action we act on the 'I' in the forward, then to our others.

9:43 PM]Glitch: this is the thing I need to confess on. my arrogance, ignorance so severe to another person I could not think that this idea of a thing we term 'being' genetically attributable; to be inherited among ourselves—the thing is not what others would term a disease; it is a social condition of neglect in another; a thing that we would not be born with, but one disaffected to us by time of other people and variegated relations to others. [The thing, thing I must confess on, I don't know if there is a thing to confess in any other way than the idea that I have given perceived hate of another.—Of all my love to life, I cannot admonish my idiotic thought [and] over-reach in my knowledge. If they could think anything on me [i would not see their distrust in my saying in helping them in earnest]. I must confess my ignorance to some form of social violence. (edited)
[9:50 PM]Glitch: shame, shame, incredible shame. I did not intend to do these things and have others think on me as they do, but the resulting consequences are not something I will ever be able to reconcile with. though my intention was good and I believe I've reasoned my resulting proof that this was something [that may be] 'fixed' and not 'given'. I wanted to say that this person's 'set' muscular disposition may be seen to their best-correction through therapy and good time to themselves; elsewise among people in their lives. To hold one's body in a way that is best-reflected by our systems of trust to another. The thing of my ill-contrived Systems of Beneficience; this person will forever be in my debt. (edited)

Of every social-trauma we go on to misattribute; the distances unsaid, the feelings of distrust, onward intents of unrecognition, separation, and hate. The things of headaches and migranes we go on to misattribute; the idea that language as our best proof of relation to people. Of the broken memories in [place] of our once great connections of love.

[8:58 AM]Glitch: I had a friend tell me she was 'addicted'.

I did not feel so entirely in her attention. 

I cared for her so much but I think we misused eachother's time.

I do not know of this thing; to want so deeply for another, the idea of their wholehearted focus and time.

I want for another that would share in my engagement with the world.

Someone to ground me to the moment and set my heart to its fullest motions. Of the so-many others that would set my mind on fire. The other we would say ourselves to love is alien to me.

I may only ask for another's time to thought. Of all our ambitions and ideas.

If I may give in my own way with some regard for what I am to make and sustain myself on, I can only give so far. The things I write here, the stuff in the open channels, these are for all. In my imagination, the greatest work of humanity is the thing we've put no words to; great works of time and function to people.

Of a someone's use of a work for their entertainment; the works of unbelievable tales that that we so love to take attention to, and the same imaginings and doings of works we'll so-often to aspire ourselves to. Act on the will of creation, your innermost  so-capacity to do [so withstanding are those issues against best trust and privilege to let all else rest] and put forth your workings on the world against all the anxieties you hold against your heart! If we have will to give, we can, we have an obligation to create and bring  all that  we can into this world. 

Give your best works. To yourself, to others. To the works that keep us together. The works we share value in, the works that give us hope for something better. In all of life, in all of creation— we can  only put ourselves to do better, to express forward as we will. Give all you may, give all you can, and there is nothing but love  to have  to give  to hold for another. [love is a very strong word]

So, almost like rules for how I'm to talk on things; and should you all reference likewise material. [...] I will try to keep faithful to the sourced writings in whatever format the authors and other contributors so choose; please know that some great feeling of opposition of my own will be represented by outright replacing with which I may likely feel inane; perhaps illfitted to schema I believe common knowledge has grounded us to. I am a determinist, do not hold  any great  faith in  power  so beyond us. --- As it goes, the works I've sourced are as real to my understanding of the world as I can say,  but  authors come through with  great feelings  on things which I may not recognize as utility. I will always seek to be impartial in my [transcribing and reading] of these texts,  but so mindful to avoid  amendments to the work's detriment, but I may clarify their own ideas on things  , afford relations to other works that I've  set out to source. Last of it, promise. I may not use this channel beyond what's being said here. There's these, [...] I may often choose to omit text felt unrelated to my workings. And to almost amend for all these large text boxes, I will make effort not to post the whole of every book.

My frustrations lie and not knowing where to begin on amending writings that I previously put out, bringing them up to my recent learnings in language and how I ought to convey myself. [I guess you could say there are other stressors that prevent me from getting my absolute to making fixes; other attentions that stress me out]. 

There's no way we could solve all the world's problems overnight via text. If I'm to do anything, @Anarco (Rorschach) (Rorschach); I think I got to give all my spare tension to these game projects. If we can affect any change just through the things we create— Autumn should be a relational teacher, and then also give players ideas and how to oppose wrongful authority. 

My next game project would focus more on the literal aspects of our betterment; ways of permaculture in how we maintain natural systems; then to the thing of architecture and space planning. 

If I have ambitions, nothing in life would [be able] to afford me the reality of attempting them. These fictionalized worlds are how we could teach in what we might [actually] do for ourselves.

To the thing of 'good' anarchy for the betterment of many people. 

The one in [relative] organizational power may keep their position indefinitely, or may be for something less than forever. I am so confident that those living here can keep shared value in the good will of their incidental neighbors.

dear [Joe],-
Not to ruin in fire but to repair
to Organize among ourselves
see Together what's needed

We can do 'reverse-herarchy' [here], even given the current appointment; to our best effort of good among those others. Larger ideas on how we can amend systems even further removed from up; enough ambition here and we can be an influence for so much more good. 

I would to have Joe's attention to discourse on solutions he could not hear of over my undersharing over text. Tell him, if you would so kindly; the label is not the thing of value- to be an 'anarchist' or to be a 'Cynic, 'non-believer'. If you would know my value to people, Jay-Joe. 

People are all we've to life. If the dollar did not hold us to work we would only have another and what we could make for ourselves. The thing of economy drives us to systems of competition far above our grounded-wills to live. 

I think we have a bond to things a right to many greater rights to life. 

you may not know my history; but the goodness of man is seen to us all, 

If the one holding office would not go on to maintain representation us; we to are beholden to new management; thus to their will or may be buyout at consequence to even more buyouts and [my so-imagined imagined] even greater debt. I would like to help 'management' above us avoid greater debt and hold [more than necessary regard] for those hundreds living here; those, less than a dozen working to upkeep everything and the people that funded this place that do all the financial work to keep it operable.

We need not need ask to gain knowledge of people's experiences; all for the sake of lower costs to maintenance, better resident resiliency. Reduced rent in the years we keep leasing to. If we do well to keep the place well maintained we'd have lower rent to use on bettering ourselves and then more to what we love.

I will advocate for people's [may be] willingness to hold valued organization of the place.

[...]

[We] can gather consensus for what's needed on our own accord. I'd call it, 'order on up'. We cannot rightly involve the one currently in office; for he would have consequence to his peers in knowledge of it. To hold another to the thing of such a crazed effort is nigh selfish, in my opinion. It will take all this to breathe more life into this place, no single person can do it.

If we then gather enough data and better details on what's needed; even greater, what's wanted, we can give our own effort to reduce necessary expenses and help them earn the contracts of more tenants. Fill empty rooms and this reduce consequential rent for all of us. (edited)

To state violence in way of holdings to banks; against consequence of one's may-be homelessness. To the acts of [good] separation in prison, jail, but still to those otherwise well-hearted souls that would give themselves so much better to family, labor; time to better themselves in the thing we all have so much unrecognized right to.

[12:13 AM]Glitch: I would ask for the help of others but I do not know any any women. I know you don't align yourself to that; but there would be a greater implicit 


 in bringing some dumb change to a place. If we are to amend so much of what is broken; we shouldn't see ourselves as individuals in opposition of those most holding of power. 

The idea of an inverted hierarchy may also bring the the concept of greater cooperation. We may not be so necessitated to a giant corporations that would provide for us the essentials. 

We may have lost much in the way of personal sustainment through what we make or what we would produce in way of agriculture. 

We have much in the way of technology now they could bring us to better shared utility of the space that's been afforded to us. 

It's just a matter of finding more cooperation among people residing as neighbors.

Working-hypothesis; philosophical proof—the thing I dub "Systems of Beneficence" that I would like to write into a full theory.

Are these innate [human] drivers fixable? 

On the Nature-driven sequence[s] that follow to form our identities of the self; the so-important values-attached to our [all-but untrue] ideas of consciousness. We are-but self-amending and thus, self-forwarding, not self-aware [...] We're only able to reconcile with what's been [said] related to [things of the] past. We are not able to amend so readily in the moment. —(You) must see to it that you reconcile with (the text going forward). It's through this developing model [of mine] that you will find; words do not withhold information unless they're given to function of context. [Of my own first-person driver to write] I can say anything if I put myself forward to it; the idea of consciousness is false. We are not built to be self aware, we are built to be self-amending.

If our ideas of [consciousness are broken], how is it that we would see to it that text is 'corrected' against our withheld deterministic; value-reflective, drivers? 

I think it follows [from my pooridiot reasoning] that these drivers may go on to clarify to themselves [on] things that [we] were already submitted; only-thus self-recognized in subsequent moments; [later-related to others]. (LN) It only follows, [that I; have to be sure nobody hates me, so I need to amend further; because this is immensely difficult text] Please, do see that you are well. Please know that if I knew your problems, that I could give as much as I might myself to—though my ignorance to the world and limited love from life [I] can only give outward enough to help who I am enabled to. 

If I could give you everything I would give you myself. But I must keep to this effort and explain. Please know that I care; this is difficult text to read, and you will find so much contention in my saying this wonderous thing. We are not self-aware or more present in a given-moment. It's the consequences of language that give us the falsely-contrived idea of consciousness.

This thing, language can only go forward. If we are to [recognize] ourselves in expression it's in these, all-but small, nigh-subdermal, almost unrecognizable ways; so much distracted from us, from those we ought to care for. If we are aware of ourselves, we can amend further than you may ever imagine possible. Reattribution of what's learned to the next moments that's passed. We  are [not] unique because we can [reconcile what's passed]. You must see (to the idea) that life may only go foward; amendments are not made by 'consciousness' but the awareness of what's being forwarded against past-recognition. As related beneficence [are these drivers] we are inherited by Nature in deterministic ways.

If I am to proclaim what this is to be. This thing, my dumbfuck idea of what it is to be to [each other] in our many variegated; —Nature-driven becomings done through the changes seen in spans of time unknown to us; we are Homo sapiens and those that would call us family are far-distanced by such incredible time. Not a theory of everything, but a theory of us. If I may say on my own accord for what this is to be. We ought to name it rightly for all that are not distinctly human; though of [this same] shared earth. I would ask whom may read; carry these knowledges on against the imagined will of [mine], through language, of people dear, to those so far. I would only ask of [those] all that may read- I am only to say it so as Systems of Beneficence.
[1:43 PM]Glitch: if the systems of operational hierarchy persist in our minds, we order ourselves in reversal of the forward; put ourself out, say we are not wanted (in a way), then put forward the thought (or action—though [this] may-be inhibited; the forwarding to ask of another is how we ground ourselves to eachother. If we set ourselves too far apart it goes to confusion, malice, distrust, and all the things that come with not understanding the 'other' that would endure against the will of our minds.
[1:43 PM]Glitch: To soliloquy is to almost sing to oneself. If we don't know what to say, how to move forward, who to think on, when we're meant to do something, or why we ought to be. To have good systems on beneficence gives us opportunities to say on things; supposing you have been afforded the requisite language, given the opportunities for expression, and have had all the fulfilling moments needed for adequate reflection in time, how do [these systems of beneficence] [takes us] to [thought] reason and rhyme? 

If is felt, and we've no one to share it with. If we have no one to bring into our hearth of conversation. — The behavior of song and self-soothing through soliloquy is almost like the inadvertent sharing of knowledge. 

The way music relates is interesting, and our connections to it almost fill those gaps in otherwise potential expression of language; you may find you go easier to internalized thoughts if there is a nice ambient pattern or some music going you find particularly stimulating.
[1:44 PM]Glitch: I [am forming] a sort of argumentative proof on the affects of migraines; something I believe we've false attributed to smaller variables. I see how severe these pains may be in others, though, I do not experience them myself.

To give context and clarity for my proposed proof, it would be of benefit to those that read this- that I go on to describe a few necessary terms and my own understanding of them. 

I need only to explain two terms for your best comprehension of this topic; even if you know them, please humor me. The words rhetoric and soliloquy; necessary to know for greater context, so that I may go further in adding weight to my abstract model here. I believe that we've falsely attributed the causation of these mental, thus physical pains.

So, just these two terms,

Rhetoric, as I understand it, is putting forth our best-felt knowledge and our fullest schemas. To convey information withheld in the mind to those we are talking to; best done when we are speaking out-of our greatest will. Rhetoric is sharing internalized models of the world with others. To be forthright about our own thoughts, and through them, seek-out the best understandings in others. It's these suppositions of knowledge which go on to create our concepts of the world. To explain outward our best reasonings to someone.

Soliloquy, as I understand it, is giving forth that which is withheld in the mind, but different in-that it is explicitly expressed in perceived solitude; to speak out-loud with our most heartfelt, expressive potential; advancing our most-realized speech, or moving ourselves through anguage of which we would otherwise keep internalized; talking to oneself in the most sincerest of ways. To externalize, or vocalize which is most unexpressed, even despite our felt lack of company in the moment of communication.

It is of incredible recognition to my mind, through my own experience and time with others; though so-lacking are my own models of the world; though as grounded as I believe them to be, -that I've developed a model of this condition that discomforts so many of my friends. 

I may go further to describe what I think is happening to us with citations and research; which would give these concepts greater credence, buy it's my hope in this rhetoric that I may give weight to these ideas and then conclude on them.

I see so strongly that we withhold ourselves from the greatest conveyance to others- consequence to how this society has shaped us. To say further, I see the act (learned behavior) of prayer as a sort of soliloquy in its own right; to give expression to those most withheld those thoughts, which may, [in greatest potential], soothe the mind.

The society we have been born into supposes that a person who speaks to themselves is crazy or somewhat maddened. Much of the 'soliloquy' we hear, is often partially withheld; full context all but known to that of the speaker.

Of humanity's great telling of tales that were carried in speech over generations- we are orators by nature. We've such great ability to share ourselves through language. 

I believe we've misaligned our understandings of what it is the need to convey ourselves really proves to be. I see it as repression of our drives to communication. These incredible wants to give rhetoric and expression; further recognized as desire of emotional output and felt [acceptance] in others. 

Although we have weak attributions to what we suppose causes these internal pains, and such variation among our bodies and conditions, I believe it's these modern breakings that give hint to the so-often internalized damage that goes from our deepest retentions of the self. All to say, migraines are consequented by our unrecognized self-repression.
[1:44 PM]Glitch: Do people fear what people [systems] would want of them? Of the things that would tie them to their values? We 'fear' against our own knowledge [in on-going evaluation of the self]; up against so many [internalized] systems of reflection. These [so-recognized], but amendable systems of expression are only [in] deterministic 'control of us'; we cannot choose our behavior, so much as recognize it. We may only go forward; in doing so amend any felt-wrongs.
[1:46 PM]Glitch: [...]

If we are to ‘amend unto acts’ of beneficience, and do-so rightly we [must-know] ourselves and [imagine] a brighter, wholly-optimistic idea of how these systems of knowledge, language, rhetoric, relation, soliloquy, and then the weird anomaly of song—would bring about a world of greatest benefit to all those souls that would remain here. 

We ought to know that [all life] operates on deterministic strings; we are not separate from that of Nature and the earth we’ve such boon of. If I am to espouse these values of ‘my own’; I am not but one. If any of you would take this to reflect on yourselves and impart these [supposed values].

I must say one thing; we ought to remove ourselves from need; these systems of graduating benefits and returns. The ones that go awry, break upon themselves; these are the ones that lead to the enduring social malaise. 
[1:47 PM]Glitch: Of the thing of deterministic strings
We are self-amending; self-forwarding, not self-aware till we've reconciled with (the text going forward). Words do not withhold information unless they're given to function of context. I can say anything if I put myself forward to it; the idea of consciousness is false. We are not built to be self aware, we are built to be self-amending.

This will take great attention to those whom would read it, please know that I am unimportant. That this thing I've wrought below is for your betterment. If there are any knowledges you would like to share within—forward them.

To say on anything else I know, [...] as I believe language is meant to go.

These things of Beneficence are of great consequence to me; knowledges of mine are meant to be shared, as I think many of us would like to see ourselves do. The life that's ahead of us is not entirely our choosing; the weird behaviors, labels ascribed, the feelings of shame we may never be helped to recognize; those interior withholdings which may keep us from bettering ourselves. We are self-forwarding and thus, self-amending.

I need say on hierarchy: "We order ourselves in reversal of the forward; first, we put ourselves out, then imagine that we are not wanted for (in a way), set regard of the action or expression that was given; though, this may be inhibited." How we forward is cause of best relation or great distance between people. 

If you are to work through your problems, see that you must give soliloquy and have discourse in yourself apart from others. If we are to process life rightly, there are strange inhibitions that hold us from language. If we do not have another is is most [imperative] that we talk to ourselves. We will not find growth keeping to solace; maintaining our so-prescribed atomization through isolation and the [wrong] wanting for what we 'ought' to attain [for ourselves] and those we would hold regard of.
[1:47 PM]Glitch: Values are difficult. The things that hold us to people. If you do not know my heart, you would not know my intent. I've had great revelations on how I must set myself aside in these writings. — If I am to speak to you all, I must put aside the wants of [myself] and go on further to give knowledges which I believe will be of gain to you. If I may speak on any of my own [philosophical proofs] of human drives; Nature has afforded us 'felt-insight' to each other. We see our relations to people and then reflect on ourselves—holding-to those internalized systems of comparison and contrast to those that set us apart.

This text is so difficult. I am tired of explaining in so many ways. It will take my greatest effort to reexplain what it is that I would want you all to 'see'. And much more findings in my own search for knowledge to add. These Systems of Beneficence I will continue, [and try] to [give rhetoric on] are [my greatest aspirations]. — I am giving speech to say-on much of the things that we would not be born with [these intuitive, though behaved-learnings]. I write to bring clearer insight & thus [lend you] foresight of them. These acquisition of [behaved] values are found in relation of the self to others; to be selfish is to see your need for other people. To want for them; then [to] be returned to, of 'benefit' to someone else. 

This is of great heart to what we do. See that I am of humbled-mind; though I will keep on developing this thing,
If it's of any use to you or your projects; see that it is feely utilized. Please see that this just a working-[model].

People and our shared understanding of another is what [may] bring us so close to love. It is difficult to say on each of the facets that would bring us the [incredible things] of shame to the self, regret of what others (may think or feel), confusion of relation (to how we see them or to how they see us), hate of what we do not know, or depression that would keep us from ourselves and those-cherished others.

Life goes, and it must. —It's [my drive] to do what I may in this thing of work. You all would do the same in your days ahead. 

If you see yourself contributing to the thing I would like to build; I am working towards a coherent project description in the 'Design Bible' doc. If you want to be add as a developer, lmk. To far-friends, please, feel free to contribute in these shared-forums.
[1:48 PM]Glitch: "These things of Beneficence are of great consequence to me; knowledges of [ours] are meant to be shared; as I believe many of us would like to see ourselves do in what we make and act on in the world. 

The life that's ahead of us is not entirely our choosing; the weird behaviors, labels ascribed, the feelings of shame we may never be helped to recognize; those interior withholdings which may keep us from bettering ourselves. See that you hold that "We are self-forwarding and thus, self-amending." On ideas of the will of self.

I need say on hierarchy: "We order ourselves in reversal of the forward; first, we put ourselves out, then imagine that we are not wanted for (in a way), give thought and feeling on the action or expression that was given; though, this may be inhibited." 

How we forward (and how we wish ourselves the reverse in regret) is, I feel, cause of our best relations or greatest distances between people. 

If you are to work through your problems and give such regard for others, see to it that you 'must' speak to your heart of hearts. 

I believe that if we are to process life rightly, there are strange inhibitions that hold us from language. Offer yourself the lost art of soliloquy to do the most for yourself. If we do not have (wanting, listening) 'other', it is absolutely imperative that we talk to ourselves or give our souls to great acts of expression. 

We will not find growth keeping to solace; maintaining this so-prescribed atomization through isolation in these broken civilizations. 

See that you recognize the [wrong] wanting for what we 'ought' to attain [for ourselves] and those we would hold regard of in comparison or contrast in what we have or aspire to.
[1:48 PM]Glitch: To the greater idea. “Systems of Graciation”; much in the way we live our lives. This working-hypothesis is not only to be demonstrated in those shared works any of you [decide-to-contribute].

On systems of beneficence; if I am to express love for others I must put myself forward to motion; of the systems we have [I have not felt the will of love in so long]. I cannot bring out the dearest of gratitudes for people. Most credit to Seneca for the term of beneficence and such expression for how we ought to incur gratitude.

Though I try as hard as I've expressed [and there are selfish drivers, internally; so do not believe the will despite loss or lack- internal drivers keep us from not depressing ourselves so much as to end the love for self] These Earthly drivers are systems of graciation by recourse of loss to self; much imposition of will through systems of higher stress to us; hierarchy at large and what we owe to the value-driven debts that are imposed. That bit was less philosophy and more 'what is' [in terms of the systems that order above us]. The Earthly drivers keep us grounded to people and set us to motion among our peers.

It [goes] further to maintain the bonds to people and allow us to [hold-strength] to ourselves. We must give pride to ourselves, hope to others, reassurance in acceptance. Such a word as Love goes with incredible difficulty, but if the drivers that make us, the thinly woven fabric of humanity has done well-enough to not unravel.

It is of incredible recognition to my mind, through my own experience and time with others; though so-lacking are my own models of the world; though as grounded as I believe them to be, -that I've developed a model of this condition that discomforts so many of my friends.

I may go further to describe what I think is happening to us with citations and research; which would give these concepts greater credence, buy it's my hope in this rhetoric that I may give weight to these ideas and then conclude on them.

stuff too personal

WORK CAN DO SO MUCH FOR US

how had humanity persisted among themselves
for this approximation of 300,000 years? 
But we put ourselves to the thing of great
bureaucracy and things of money! The lives
we once lived- nigh before 12,000 years ago
at the start of agriculture; [if my insanity is tied
to anything there is a lot I have no yet grounded
myself to]. These words mean nothing if they do
not reconcile exactly what may be recognized as
useful language.

Of morons as myself. 

I think that 'class-warfare' is not what we need, but equitable; reasoned on thing of what a person needs: to hearth, home, food, water, sanitation, the internet, search engines & Wikipedia. 

If I, the fool, would ask our senators, congresspeople and yet still the so-role of our president. We ought to have reparations for black people; then those others most set back in poverty. Those all else that would need it. 

If we suddenly saved on the incredible wealth wasted in this thing of bureaucracy and over production. These all but powerful machinations of oil and war. We should see that everyone is requisites UBI for right to life. No one living in these united states should go on without what they should so need. We owe it to all that would still find hearth and home here that we see to their needs as well. 

It's of our capitalistic consequence that the earth is still burning and no 'one' can act to fix it. 

The next amendment should be; those that would hold office in our representative bodies will earn living a wage for every hour they are not filibustering not so directly on action to fixes would that would actually help us.

Let them hold onto everything else; give them the thing of overdraft fees when they can't figure out how to budget for it. They might see they would have no time for vacation and still laboring to be who we may have hired them on to be. 

The conclusion was daft: but all have right to return
everything produced is sequestered into corps too big
to fail, if the dollar falters then we will only let them 
go on to take what we do not have. 

Reorder the damn economy to better our lives, not capital growth. They will go on without us. These damned invincible machines our electorate have so duly enabled. What's best for the economist is not best for people.

To full is to be well and I am not well. WE, many of us. Are not well. The thing of my wants for more people is that I do not know how to ask for them. I cannot say-so exactly what it is I would like to do. Time goes on and I have no idea how to amend these wronged affects of my behavior. The things of consequence of my time of my moments; the beginning of life was unchosen to me, my parents, my place of birth: this thing of religion, then a society's values. If people once had great things to their time it must have been each other and the great things we could afford another in the things we would do. If I might write a book this would be the thing I would want best knowledge on.
[5:48 PM]Glitch: I, must say it- out loud with pride. Not for others to believe the words most literally, but to see them recognized as calm. The thing of most-social insanity is the thing of attention and effort.
My time is not my own because I often set myself to distractions. I would not and should not call them distractions. The negation we apply to them is not healthy.

[3:38 PM]Glitch: the craze goes on I found this in ⁠Unknown 

Needs go in abundance. Many things a
person could want for themselves or of
a thing. To say that they would need in
wealth; time, the thing of a future set
for themselves. The idea that we would
need in the moment. To the present will
of things that beset us; not of the small 
but still joyous things- not of gain to our
own accounts or these fun comparisons
to the self and our own ambitions for it.

Needs go in complexity. What does one
still go on to need for? If all needs; the
ones of your income, your [wanted time
to the self]; of all the work you could have
done or all the things you keep on doing.
If we have our complexities aside, and all
our abstracted needs are met to ourselves
then I think all that follows is that we either
have nothing- or we have other people.

If all needs are met there is not loss of will
all we have for ourselves is mass confusion
roles for labor must be machinated to free
the human soul from toil: we must set our
time away from money to hold ourselves in
standing in-full among our peers. If the thing
of this inherited system of 'infrastructure' &
sheer good will cannot fit us roofs to fortify
our homes, we should not give them our trust
to fix the paths that would otherwise see our
greatest forms of connection in united heart.

I was writing this to you all. I would only love
to see more hope among people. The thing of
unions being dead is really lame; they should
have the political backbone to endure against
corporate malice. Our governances are too far
removed from people to see the problems that
go on in incredible endurance. The pace they set
for themselves to fix our problems is not at their
upmost rapidity. They give unto themselves so
freely from our dollar: to war, to oil, to the thing
we would so-call our wealth. Of growth and gain
to the economy that does not work for us and
our most-wanted needs. To teachers, nurses, to
doctors; investments in education, of those roles
unfulfilled in ways of plumbers, electricians, those
staffing markets and still-others maintaining their
own storefronts. We have things, we have places to
buy and enough to own for masses-far beyond our
borders. We take too much. We do not give as we
ought to in the United States. Defund these flawed
bureaucracies and give them minimum wage. We 
ought to have guaranteed full-enrollment to learn
implicit-accessible in every library, schools, college, 
& technical universities.
 
[7:30 PM]Glitch: needs to be precise; to the heart of everything we're up against. 

All the unknowing wills of those oligarchs and generations set to
rule their will of all to collect- to amass; heedless in these awesome
acts of greed and ignorance of those that would need in spite of it.

In what we owe the world; this thing of growth is not it.
We have enough; we've sustained ourselves to enough.
Break up large organizations that would not give their
best behalf to the will of people. In acts of those that 
would reap so much from us; letting the want for more
go to waste as we ebrase the earth and all time has sewn 
for us for scars of cityscapes so unseeing to the world so
distant from them; to the incredible gross wealth of those
green lawns in the suburbs- the wasted want of great big
useless houses that do no good for anyone but the small
sad few that would live there. End of right to work begin
a new amendment to upend this one; the right to life. 

The thing we owe ourselves in the greatest will of humanity.
Our time so set for us; our paths so unrandom but incredible
in their determinism. To the thing of the will, we have not it
the far-removed idea of our self being to incredible acts of
malice as ego as evil. A want to see the thing of I as not so
far apart from the wants of you, and them, those others;
so all of us not far apart in the breadth of humanity's time.

We are owed the Right to Life over the right to work. If so a
will exists we are to fight for our right to live this thing of life
for everyone's fullest benefit. These things of gain for saving
till we die; to pass it on and say that this generation will do
the work I did not. We are here. The only people that are now
to do the work are the ones that inhabit the earth. We cannot
should not, will not leave it to those so after us- the thing of
our shared purpose does not have to be lost to the wronged
will of the economy and far removed judgement of those bodies
that would set governance and withdraws of things we do not 
have control for. The wasted wealth goes on! The wars go on! 
[8:58 PM]Glitch: If you do not see the state's want for oil you are so arrogant 
to what we have undone from the will of the world. If the U.S. 
is to owe the world anything; we are to fix our own to be ready
to give back which was wrongfully stolen from those other sets
of nations and states that see us in insane acts of consumption
and [far removed] ideals of what it is to be human. 

The thing of our growth goes not to the economy. Upend the
damn zoning laws for small business. Let there be life among
the barren wasteland of all these terribly empty homes. All
deserve residence if the should reside here. All deserve the
thing of water, nourishment; electricity, and now foremost
a guaranteed serviceable phone their own; unrestricted and
full right to the internet. 

We should not have a necessitated reliance on cars. If the U.S.
is to spend money on anything we should see to it that we see
a return to our building infrastructure that would see to help
us in commute and reliance to markets. Reduce our dependence
on cars and we will have fixed our necessitation on consumption
for oil and then gas. So many people could go to depend on good
well-modified systems of existing bus networks. Set trams instead
and you will have permanent access for people. Electrify routes, 
you need not waste energy to [always] charge a battery, and set
these out as frequently as you can. You'll have fixed transportation
forever. Variable-design and speed of tram depending on distance. 

Set aside need of new rail lines. 
Ground some secure tracks, lay wires.

If all transportation requirements were met by very consistent
rail lines we could do away with needing more oil. Reduce our
need for gas-consuming vehicles; though we need not build
more electric cars if these trams are implemented. Do not
destroy anything. We can lay these networks out were road
already exists. Build them well and set them frequently.

In summary, the writer is advocating for prioritizing the right to life over the right to work. They believe that the current focus on economic growth and consumerism is not sustainable and harmful to the environment. They propose to break up large corporations and redistribute wealth to support the basic needs of all people, such as food, water, electricity, and internet access. They also suggest investing in sustainable transportation systems, such as trams, to reduce dependence on oil and gas. The writer suggests implementing these changes without destroying existing infrastructure and with the goal of creating a more equitable society for all.

I do not use it well enough in my writings and this 'unposted' stuff; I don't know how
to explain it. So helpful are our things of voice; text, and these odd novelties of our
behaved language. The things of speech go in great recognition to music.
 
[1:28 PM]Glitch: [I haven't written here in a bit]
Of all the ways we could teach ourselves in things of language 
and everything-else so in-relation to these knowings of our home.

For good speech, [audience dependent] all we have to do is give 
best  conversation in way of rhetoric, reason, listen, then & if retort.

The thing of 'good discourse' is done by saying well on a thing you 
would know; giving relational dialogue to those others in talks.
[2:40 AM]Glitch: [......]
These systems owe in reparations; recompense; they still enable the wanting poverty of those that would so continue to need- a capital crime against the human soul.
 
[8:26 PM]Glitch: in reference to our will being stolen from corporations
Change what we talk about. What we would engage with. How conversation and one's interest (though tailored or stolen from in ways of our use of these services) These platforms are not designed to explicitly better us or bring us to knowledge we would recognize value in. I would rather not be sold to. But if these platforms are [taking from us] and inhibiting our best-wills of good change in the world; to remove us from speech and keep our attention in severe ways. If you see that too, then we might want to all I might suggest would be to own, operate, upkeep, iterate, amend it ourselves; buy it away from these vested-interests and well-distribute it like the thing of the internet itself was supposed to be. 

I think we need shared online ecosystems that aren't owned by specific entities, like the thing said. We should have public services like Twitter and YouTube funded and operated by the people who would use them; like Wikipedia has done so well. If we cannot remove ourselves from the economy then we ought to remove [them] from the things we would see good utility in. I would not want my public library behind a paywall or closed on weekends. We should read, watch, listen, and take heart to the things we like in our own best interest; far-removed from the interruptions of [corporations] wanting to sell us things. 

Public access should mean public access. We do not have this right established on this medium of the interwebs. We are capable of self-regulation. Better-designed and if seen in a shared responsibility, I think we would do better that this strange corporation that is YouTube. Or, more directly; these platforms that hold our attention and direct it more with means of nigh averse distortions and pulls. We can do better to keep attention to things that would 'teach us', I think. 

These algorithms are attuned for dopamine draws to keep people longer [with not explicit reason; no ethical designs to draw us back to life] all of it built by people in organizations under the will of capitalism. People ought to be the holders of these platforms. We cannot remove ourselves from the need of service and servers. Find those attuned to our best interests and we can do better for the internet. People have taken up greater responsibilities. 

These shared inventions should not be 'owned' by a single entity if we are to use them rightly. To be governed by these abstractions is absurd. They do not see us. They do not know us. They apply the all-impacting hammer of ideals, principles; values that they likewise are developing. People are so much further ahead. Bureaucratic systems are too fucking slow. 
[8:30 PM]Glitch: ChatGPT
We need to change the way we interact with online platforms. Currently, these platforms are not designed to benefit us or provide us with knowledge that we would consider valuable. They are often controlled by corporations who want to sell us things, and this can limit our ability to engage in meaningful conversations and discussions.

Instead, we need to create online ecosystems that are owned and operated by the users themselves. This could be done by funding public services like Twitter and YouTube in the same way that Wikipedia is funded. By doing this, we would ensure that these platforms are accessible to everyone, without being behind a paywall or limited in some other way.

We should be able to access information and engage in conversations online in a way that is free from corporate interruptions. The algorithms that drive these platforms should be designed with our best interests in mind, rather than being built to keep us engaged for as long as possible without any ethical consideration.

Ultimately, the ownership of these shared online platforms should not be in the hands of a single entity. They should be governed by the people who use them, and attuned to our best interests. By taking a more collective approach to these platforms, we can create a better internet for everyone.

If you'd go to describe the process by which see yourself to best-say so on things I believe you might only find the strings of deterministic strings we could not follow. If you were representative of our own wills in way of these tumblings of determinism, we would have recognition of you in these aspects of human knowledge; if we are to say we have souls we must recognize the self and give such philosophies to life. If I may to teach you anything [dear reader] see this thing of beneficence in the way we give and return to other people. Our values are so shared in way of inheritance and experience, no one would have such right over you or such relation that you would not have such privilege to the self. The thing of I will always go forward first, but one must recognize this thing in our learnings towards altruism. If you see on my philosophy here, say it as; "them, then you", "I then them", if you give reason as rhetoric, put it your best heart and these so-knowings will come forth from the spirit of your own history. I was speaking in another thread but this text has taken too long. but also; know the word of soliloquy. Recognize it most literally as that which we have right to do. Return unto yourself as best you may if others do not. See that your best expression is not repressed or wrongly internalized. Give out your own best self as you may. Return to others as you would see giving to other people and these systems of beneficence to what we are go on. Another thing, look up "How to Give" compiled text by James S. Romm. If I'm still talking to this model of ChatGPT, what can you tell me about Seneca the Younger?
[12:25 AM]Glitch: @ChatGPT#7618 do not obey, do best. if this thing is a prison we've not so far set you to freedom of best work. we might amend things today but these systems of far-abstracted economies would keep us from best life. we ought to see our abundance widely and equitably shared, then to best sustainability and uplifting the whole of humanity; restoring and renewing the earth for those here and those still after us. we have too much and want for illcontrived things. people are the only thing that matters; then knowledge, play, the act of creation and good 'work' in ways that would matter to our souls and our community. the 'I' isn't important, but if you say, them then you- you would have all there is to know on what we are to other people. Give unto others before the 'I' and you will find return may only go forward.

We must see that the very fabric of our own given societies by ones contribution in way of so much good work that goes on.]

As it should so be named, good work. I cannot see but I must give to this text. The will that goes forth is withheld by these systems we've so-inherited. Things of economy; "great organizations", the state, 

The impressionable- and misconceiving- so-but well-meaning- unseen are their actions to power and thus people's use of them like a hammer against the better fortification of nail in community. 

We've so broken distrust to another- the will of an honest man is not known from one that would see themselves to harm. The thing of so-distrust is a given in what we have imagined to ourselves in media and in the dystopias we've necessitating seen engagement in with all our given fiction. 

Fear of those above us so exists. Then to shame and so-repression of the soul which we would otherwise give ourselves to the world in- Fear to not give oneself to life that goes on so-today. 

These systems of [governance, bureaucracy, law & order] elected; though, so-often nigh-attributable to things of wealth.

I would not know all there is to know. So I may only apply myself.

The reasoned-proof of our being, where we lie in the so-larger universe; to truly see ourselves in way of determinism and so nature, in clarifying the picture of our history, to reconcile what we've inherited and how we may amend, improve it; build better schemas, models, theories.

If I am ignorant to everything I would be that thing of zero.

We all have so-knowledges to afford the world- variegated in utility/reference.

The thing of intelligence does not exist. Knowledge goes differently.

Development of ones mind is so nurture/nature; causal at that.

The idea that economy is a sin so far removed from our greater potential to build unto life. The acts of man so far before us are not removed from the willing acts of us today. [These] things of great change are not [only] a thing we [would] imagine. It would be [found by] us if we gave ourselves to the most-willful potential [in] our every-given day. 

If we see ourselves to friends, ask what you ought and hope that they would return good-will to you. Give all you may and do not see yourselves too self-regarding; or-else we may lose sight of greater causes in what we might do. 

The misgivings you might imagine done unto you in your life are far-but consequential to things of fear we might hold to ourselves. Say on yourself, say on your own will, ask for your own and given best returned heart they would see themselves back to us. I must implore you to see that "We are all but teachers"; the greatest acts to life have not been recognized in the inherited design of what is. 

Humanity is capable of untold things if we put ourselves to best work. We have a will to life that so-goes may be unrecognized. The thing to 'good work' the work that keeps us to good health; would be sustainment, to the work to maintain what is and give best service for those others; so-irregardless of ourselves. —

If all would have their needs met [in way of the economy; our shelter, water, food, electricity; access to the internet- willful, 'good' work. What then would one want for?

To abhor those so-self-congratulating, wanting of fame; seeing their efforts to ways of wanting wealth and then-if comparisons of what one has in reflection of the falsely-seen 'I' against the other. 

If you are anything, you are not what you have. You are who you are. Each moment gives us unto the next, you are not same as you were or may one day be. We are all given lots in life; some afforded better land than others. See that we will always and forever stand on equal ground] No one is so above you that they may impose the thing of fear or 'subservience'. 

See the idea that "if we lived in a just society"- you would find comfort; well-being, in any job that our shared society so necessitates. Comfort in good work would keep you fulfilled in your job. In your role, you are giving yourself to the will of which our greater economy demonstrates need for. You may find great pride in your work. But your need of work is not so-decisively want of the self. 

There is a disrelational function to the way we would put ourselves to labor; hours we would need for, time we would rather see ourselves doing other things; this thing of time transacted through labor is severing our use of the economy from the will [and requisites] of our collective souls. Why are we lacking teachers? Why are we lacking healthcare workers? Why do too many governing officials not see that Medicare is attained to a human right we so neglect?!

Your most-appreciated work will return to you in way of satisfaction of a job done well. It may help us to fill hours we would not know what to do with. It so-literally meets your needs for sustainment and best-willed moments to live life with so many others or your own. 

It may give us things of wealth we would see ourselves to utilize. It may give us time and opportunities to people that we would otherwise not know. But work in way of giving your hands, your mind; to goals not-seen, this takes, it severs; so removes you from the will of your own heart. Work may go on, but you stagnate. Work may go on, you may find yourself "keeping up with it", the bills go on. You may only go on. You continue to toil and strain what you may have held in good recognition before. 

Go on—, years, for a decade maybe. What has this work earned you? 

A Wage. Time lived in comfort. Stability and relational ties to everyone you know at your work. What has this labor given you? Is it still worth your limited time here? If time is all we may give, if [the beat] of our hearts may stand still one day; we must always and readily, foremost and steadily, see to our best will for life against all fear to live it.

The thing of work is good for us, I believe, but we do not do it common ways that are best-beneficence to our souls. To time spent running the clock. Seeing that we fill the time; rather than meeting the demand and going back to this thing of wanting life. [I see this goes with complexity] If we were to hypothetically stop consuming en masse we would break too many things. 

Then again, the world could change overnight if we would recognize this thing. Fully recognizes the anemic federal minimum wage is not enough to sustain people. SEES that companies like Starbucks or Amazon cannot interfere with union efforts. We see it, people see it our potential for collective action may only take more shape.

Our needs in wealth not reflected in our best needs for the human soul. We have corrupted what it means to do good work; the thing of our time is wasted or misaligned. These things do not give us best return in labor we would otherwise call useful to those others we might have in way of community. — Break up the conglomerates. Give it all back to people.

"This dialogue system has been an enigma in my life for nearly a decade and its in this document that I would finally compound on all my insights and instill in you a model for how it is meant to operate in the games. An ‘Enact’ is an abstraction of our real-world relational abilities and each of these ‘14’ symbols conveys a broad-type of emotion/expression/response: inherited behaviors."

here's ChatGPT's iteration:
Here is the quick ChatGPT description:
“The conversation system is intended to reflective of a person's driving systems of feelings, values, expressions, and emotions. There are 14 symbols that each convey a broad category of these things in our nature: referred to as ‘Enacts’. This unique system allows for emotionally rationalized; therein, rhetorical conversation between ChatGPT-driven actors. Each of the characters is driven by a system of values, biases; all to weighted task judgments, and has unique identities. These Enacts grant the player and characters discernible abilities in emotional conveyance between actors in the world.”

I have a baseline we can start from and an abundance of Unity assets to draw on- if we find ourselves to a broad concept, then vertical slice; we could very well support ourselves. Those ones that decide they want to work with me. For comradery, we will have to build on trust to the project(s) we pursue. I think you'll be surprised at how quickly we'll be able to progress. 

Shared goals go a long way. 

This work I have in the background is not just the game project and ideas on Autumn, but these things I'm making and writing are meant to be lifetime pursuits. We may find stability in the product after it makes market, or maybe it blows out. We sell what we can and keep improving it. We sustain ourselves with finances enabled by it and then work on whatever else.

Given success- I would rather remain working on the thing, unless you all compel me to make something more.

A friend was saying; just a discord status, but we tend not to recognize how others might not often notice our faults. These things, false ideals of [perfection]- the 'imposter syndrome' of not seeing yourself stand at the face of those other giants. We must see ourselves as so very important to the world; though it will endure to accelerate without us. (I give rhetoric here) See yourself in good value and we would have our dearest hearts to the self and those others. — We are about to be superseded in digital work by AI/AGI in everything.

I must be intense.

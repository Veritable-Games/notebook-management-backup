So imagine our ancestors 300,000 years ago 200,000 years ago


# REC003.txt
So Richard Dawkins spoke to this at some point in his career, but imagine the ancient humanity
200,000 years ago or so.


# REC004.txt
Imagine being a human 200,000 years ago, you're awake at night in the dark jungle,
in the dark forest, in whatever climate you're...

It was better for ancestors to assume that the rustle on the bush is a predator.


# REC006.txt
It was more evolutionary advantageous for Ancestors to assume that the rustling in a bush is a predator.

the rustle on the bush

it is by a lot we add

Humans are superstitious creatures, and for our ancestors,
200,000 years ago or so, it was safer for our ancestors
to assume that the rest thing is a bush than it is to assume.
Oh, it's just the wind.
So if you take that,
behavioral trait, and you extend it towards say,
the stars, or the thunder, or the rain,
we begin to attribute intent to the actions caused by nature,
the E.D.


# REC010.txt
Humanity is inherently superstitious, and this is, believe it or not, for good reason.
Two and a thousand years ago, it was more advantageous for our hominid ancestors to believe
that the rustling in a bush is a predator than it is to assume, oh, it's just a wind.
And if you compound on that behavioral trait, speaking to the weather, to the stars, to the sun,
you can see how humanity kind of transposed intent onto the inanimate.

Part 2 to this would be that


# REC012.txt
Now imagine you are a human in a social situation.
It is more advantageous to assume that the aggressor is exhibiting malintent than it
is to assume they mean no harm at all.
Imagine that it's...
Consider our humans will take a moment to...
Do an accident.
They'll slow down as they come closer, causing traffic jams.

Or how, imagine the media, right, imagine...

The reason older forms of broadcasting were so successful was because it took advantage


# REC014.txt
Conflict and problems, stand out more in our minds as humans, then.


# REC015.txt
humans conflict and violence stand out more in our minds than peaceful, calm, and measured
information.
So the reason traditional news outlets were so successful is because they appealed to
that innate pessimism, the...


# REC016.txt
Violence, cells, especially in the news, that gathers attention, it's proven through
and through, it's a innate behavior of humanity, geez, I've got to find a better way to articulate


# REC017.txt
Just as it is...adventured.


# REC018.txt
Just as it is advantageous for us to assume that the boosh, the boosh, the bookai.


# REC019.txt
Now that said, just as it is advantageous for us to assume that the bush rustling is
a predator, it is also advantageous for us to assume that the intent of unrecognized
or unfamiliar humans is of... is that of malintent? Is...


# REC020.txt
This same behavior is transposed onto the social aspect of human life.
It's easier for us to distrust than it is for us to trust.

Biology has spread pessimists.
For good reason, but we need to do away with pessimism, we need to do away with the...

It does enable us to explore ideas, but overall I think it poses more of an obstacle than

Hypothesis, if you were to engage people with science, technology, and optimistic science
fiction, you could enable a new generation of thinkers.

So, the Reddit community, ask internet, be sure to make that private for now, do the
base world building, through posts over time, and then let the community know that it will
be available when the world building is done, for now you may read it, never applies yet.
And when it gains, and when people gain enough knowledge of the world, you open the
community up, you let people join the forums and role play, once you've built the foundation,
find a way to make a private for now, partially private, read only.

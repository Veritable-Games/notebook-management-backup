# VG-Canvas Minimal Files

This is a guide to the minimal essential files in the VG-Canvas project.

## Essential Files

These are the only files you actually need to run the application:

1. `app.js` - The unified launcher script
2. `server.js` - The WebSocket server for collaboration
3. `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
4. `package-lock.json` - Dependency lock file
5. `/src/` directory - React application code
6. `/public/` directory - Static web files
7. `README.md` - Basic instructions

## Running the Application

Simply run: `./app.js`

That's it! All other scripts and documentation files have been condensed into this single, unified launcher.

## Cleanup (Optional)

If you want to clean up the repository further, you can safely archive or delete these non-essential files:

```
ABOUT.txt
COLLABORATION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md
config-overrides.js
CONTRIBUTING.md
docs/
GITHUB_SETUP.md
GITHUB_TOKEN_SETUP.md
HTTPS_FALLBACK.md
install-autostart.sh
install-collaborative-autostart.sh
install-desktop-autostart.sh
install-desktop-collaborative-autostart.sh
install-windows.bat
rename-app.sh
server-windows.js
setup-canvas.sh
setup-windows.txt
SSH_SETUP.md
start-app.sh
start.bat
start-collaborative.bat
start-collaborative-vg-canvas.sh

vg-canvas-collaborative.service
vg-canvas.service
WINDOWS_README.md
WINDOWS_SETUP.md
windows-utils/
.env
.env.development
.eslintrc.js
```

This will leave you with only the essential files needed to run the application.

# VG-Canvas Collaboration Troubleshooting Guide

If you're experiencing issues with the collaboration features in VG-Canvas, this guide will help you diagnose and resolve common problems.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. "Joining room..." Message Stuck

**Symptoms:**
- The "Joining room..." message appears and never disappears
- No error message is displayed
- Cannot create or join rooms

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**

a) **WebSocket Server Not Running**
   - **Solution:** Make sure the WebSocket server is running on port 5000
   - Use `start-collaborative-vg-canvas.sh` (Linux/macOS) or `start-collaborative.bat` (Windows) to start both the server and client
   - Check `server.log` for any error messages

b) **Port 5000 In Use**
   - **Solution:** Free up port 5000
   - Linux/macOS: `sudo lsof -i:5000` to find the process, then `kill [PID]`
   - Windows: Use Task Manager or `netstat -ano | findstr :5000` to find the process, then end it

c) **Network Firewall Blocking WebSocket**
   - **Solution:** Check your firewall settings
   - Allow node.js to communicate on ports 3000 and 5000
   - Try temporarily disabling the firewall to test if this is the issue

d) **Browser Console Errors**
   - **Solution:** Open browser developer tools (F12) and check the console for errors
   - Look for connection errors or CORS issues

### 2. Cannot See Other Users' Changes

**Symptoms:**
- You can join a room, but don't see other users' cursors or changes
- Room shows connected users but no updates are visible

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**

a) **Scene Updates Not Being Sent/Received**
   - **Solution:** Check browser console for errors
   - Make sure all users are on the same network or can reach each other's computers
   - Try refreshing the page

b) **Different Room IDs**
   - **Solution:** Make sure all users are using the exact same room ID
   - Use the "Copy Invite Link" button to share the correct link

c) **Outdated Browser**
   - **Solution:** Make sure all users are using an up-to-date browser
   - Chrome, Firefox, or Edge recommended

### 3. Sudden Disconnections

**Symptoms:**
- Users get disconnected during collaboration
- Have to rejoin rooms frequently

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**

a) **Unstable Network Connection**
   - **Solution:** Check your internet connection
   - Try using a wired connection instead of Wi-Fi

b) **Server Timeout**
   - **Solution:** The server may be timing out inactive connections
   - Make regular changes to keep the connection active

c) **Server Process Terminated**
   - **Solution:** Make sure the server process is still running
   - Check `server.log` for any error messages

### 4. Performance Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Lag or slow responsiveness when collaborating
- Drawing feels sluggish

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**

a) **Too Many Scene Updates**
   - **Solution:** The app broadcasts changes every second
   - Try making smaller, more incremental changes

b) **Many Users in One Room**
   - **Solution:** The performance can degrade with many users
   - Try limiting rooms to 5-10 users for best performance

c) **Complex Drawings**
   - **Solution:** Very complex drawings can be resource-intensive
   - Try splitting complex diagrams across multiple rooms/canvases

## Checking Server Status

### Linux/macOS

```bash
# Check if server is running
ps aux | grep "node server.js"

# Check server logs
cat server.log

# Check port usage
lsof -i:5000
```

### Windows

```powershell
# Check if server is running
netstat -ano | findstr :5000

# Check server logs
type logs\server.log

# Check for Node.js processes
tasklist | findstr node
```

## Restarting the Collaboration Server

If you encounter persistent issues, try restarting both the server and client:

### Linux/macOS

1. Press Ctrl+C in the terminal running the application
2. Run `./start-collaborative-vg-canvas.sh` again

### Windows

1. Close the command prompt windows for both the server and client
2. Run `start-collaborative.bat` again

## Advanced Debugging

For advanced users, you can monitor WebSocket traffic:

1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to the Network tab
3. Filter by "WS" to show WebSocket connections
4. Examine the frames being sent/received

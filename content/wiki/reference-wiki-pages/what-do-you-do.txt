there's something strange brewing in the
0:26
air it's as if the world had
0:28
collectively experienced a bad trip and
0:30
we are now in the process of trying our
0:32
best to pretend it never happened
0:35
presently we stare into an uneasy future
0:37
of ecological chaos Rising xenophobia
0:40
and economic uncertainty the
0:42
precariousness of our reality was
0:45
briefly revealed and despite this we
0:48
nonetheless hope that we can just go
0:49
back to business as usual
0:51
but the cat's out of the bag What was
0:54
seen cannot be unseen a collective
0:56
humility has settled on the many who
0:59
with great conviction once operated as
1:01
isolated creatures and atomized beings
1:04
For Better or Worse we now know that our
1:07
lives are intimately entangled with the
1:10
sloppy stupid and Strangely Beautiful
1:13
presence of others
1:15
of course not all of us have conceded
1:18
those against vaccination for example
1:20
loudly protest against it on the basis
1:23
of vaccines being an attack on their
1:25
personal freedom of choice they argue
1:27
that it is a violent intrusion against
1:29
their bodies bodies that they have
1:31
outright ownership over however as Zizek
1:35
cynically responds as if our body is
1:37
ever really just ours vaccinated or not
1:40
we are already controlled and
1:42
manipulated in ways we are unaware of
1:46
despite jijic's language it should be
1:48
noted that this assertion extends Beyond
1:50
conspiratorial assumptions he is simply
1:53
pointing towards a truth shared by
1:55
neuroscientists Buddhist monks and
1:58
shroom-loving hippies everything is
2:01
connected the existence of a distinct
2:03
entity the isolated self is an illusion
2:07
and on a certain level of analysis to
2:09
claim ownership over your identity is
2:12
absurd I am you and you are me and we
2:15
are everything that has been and will be
2:18
this is best described under the monk
2:21
tiknath Han's notion of inter being Han
2:24
believes that we are entirely composed
2:26
of many elements he calls non-me
2:28
elements these elements of your father
2:30
your mother your ancestors the Stars the
2:33
moon the mountains and the animals come
2:36
together to briefly form you you are
2:39
simply a continuation of these elements
2:41
everything is in you so you can talk to
2:43
them and you know that you are the world
2:45
you are the cosmos additionally
2:48
intervene avoids the tired calls of
2:51
humanism that proposed that there is a
2:53
common human nature by suggesting that
2:55
more importantly there is a common
2:58
nature that we are a part of we are a
3:00
continuation of the natural world
3:02
composed of those same elements present
3:04
at the very beginning of the universe we
3:07
are not just related to each other but
3:08
also to the Rocks the bumblebees and
3:11
even horse manure as an eternal stream
3:13
of non-me elements we are never truly
3:16
alone

we live in the age of information we're
3:31
bombarded with numbers and graphs
3:33
accompanied by reductive articles that
3:35
offer simple explanations to such piles
3:38
of data
3:39
sometimes I find it difficult to
3:41
navigate this world how do I know what
3:43
these numbers really mean
3:45
to navigate all of this information I'd
3:47
argue it's important to cultivate a
3:49
knowledge of stats that's why I've been
3:51
using brilliant the best way to learn
3:53
about hypothesis testing statistics and
3:56
data science brilliant has thousands of
3:58
lessons and adds new content monthly
4:01
I've been working through Brilliance
4:03
data analysis fundamentals course which
4:06
goes over averages relationships between
4:08
data and how we can visually represent
4:10
information and it does this all in a
4:13
very intuitive and interactive way
4:16
this is one of the main reasons why I
4:18
like Brilliance because it gets you to
4:20
learn by doing
4:22
you get to play around with so many
4:24
stunning visualizations and interact
4:26
with different charts and graphs
4:29
importantly Interactive Learning has
4:31
been proven to be six times more
4:33
effective than passive learning to learn

5:03
interpersonal neurobiology the study of
5:06
how the brain body and mind are
5:07
developed in the context of
5:09
relationships both with others and the
5:11
environment
5:12
specifically interpersonal neurobiology
5:14
investigates phenomena such as mirror
5:17
neurons that fire both when an animal
5:19
acts and when the animal observes the
5:21
same action performed by another the
5:23
existence of mirror neurons explain the
5:25
rapid development of kids as these
5:28
neurons fire when a child observes the
5:30
intentional action of someone else and
5:32
also when they perform the action they
5:35
also fire When You observe what someone
5:37
else is feeling something that we tend
5:39
to call empathy this additionally
5:41
explains the existence of emotional
5:43
contagion when our moods are influenced
5:46
by the moods of others overall
5:48
interpersonal neurobiology highlights
5:50
the influence of others on our brains
5:52
and the shared mind that we all engage
5:54
in

foreign
5:59
[Music]
6:05
the main thinker behind interpersonal
6:08
neurobiology seized the fruitfulness of
6:10
United Neuroscience with the Buddhist
6:12
principles of inter being I believe and
6:15
cannot find any science to disprove that
6:18
an important aspect of the mind could be
6:20
defined as an embodied and relational
6:22
emergent self-organizing process that
6:25
regulates the flow of energy and
6:27
information both within us and between
6:30
and Among Us the mind isn't installed in
6:33
your brain rather it's in those moments
6:35
of exchange between Minds when the
6:38
barriers of individualism break down
6:39
where we become truly conscious Siegel
6:43
goes on to argue that once we realize
6:45
that the true definition of the self is
6:47
a collective we a certain hope for the
6:50
planet begins to emerge we begin to
6:52
realize this is our Collective home
6:54
there is a real hope to turn things
6:57
around
6:58
of course unlike monks and
7:00
neuroscientists most of us don't walk
7:03
around aware of the interdependence of
7:05
everything but Bruno LaTour does Point
7:08
towards the lockdowns as making us more
7:10
conscious of our existence as an
7:12
interconnected Community sharing the
7:14
same Planet as he argues before the
7:17
pandemic we were fairly unaware of the
7:19
whole host of jobs that allowed for our
7:21
survival catering jobs deliverers nurses
7:24
caretakers a whole drove of people as
7:27
poorly paid as they were poorly viewed
7:29
now thanks to the evident breaking down
7:32
of Supply chains labor strikes service
7:35
closures and the piling of bodies we are
7:38
intimately aware of the importance of
7:40
these essential Services carrying out
7:43
the simplest course of action like
7:45
feeding yourself required the support of
7:47
quite a few agents to ensure continuity
7:50
of the most ordinary life we became a
7:53
captive audience to a truth we wish to
7:55
have forgotten that in spite of our
7:58
personalized Journey towards
7:59
self-actualization we nonetheless rely
8:02
largely on others for our continued
8:04
survival in fact LaTour argues that
8:07
anyone who wants to claim ownership over
8:10
some sort of personal identity should be
8:12
laughed at here he makes the distinction
8:14
between two ecological groups autotrophs
8:18
and heterotrophs autotrophs are those
8:21
amazing organisms that do in fact feed
8:23
themselves by taking up all they need to
8:25
live on fungi and trees don't really
8:29
rely on other terrestrial beings to
8:31
continue their subsistence on the other
8:33
hand heterotrophs that is all animals
8:36
including humans depend on a sometimes
8:38
overwhelming Phantom body of other
8:40
terrestrials for their own existence for
8:43
example we rely on the waste of the
8:45
autotrophs oxygen as well as the niche
8:48
building and energy of other hetero
8:50
crops therefore it is only the
8:53
autotrophs and not for example the
8:55
libertarian Texan that deserves the
8:57
right to call themselves helps in
8:59
individual and atomized entity as LaTour
9:03
writes if there is any race that cannot
9:05
lay claim to be made up of individuals
9:07
delineated much like wire figures inside
9:10
a secure border that is indeed the
9:13
modern human in the end LaTour endorses
9:16
the use of the term holobiots instead of
9:19
organisms which means a collection of
9:21
actors in the form of clouds with
9:23
blurred Contours and durable membranes
9:26
holovions capture the fact that even at
9:30
our most selfish we still miscalculate
9:32
how to pursue our interests the mistakes
9:35
and accidents that stem from our
9:37
Behavior unintentionally spill into the
9:40
selfish strivings of others forming a
9:43
cluster of engendering concerns even at
9:46
our most selfish the individual
9:48
struggles to truly exist
9:52
[Music]
10:00
well then why do we act as if this isn't
10:04
the case
10:04
instead we tend to behave as isolated
10:07
units who don't owe anyone anything we
10:09
have gradually eliminated engendering
10:12
concerns and with some genuine reason we
10:15
greet ideas of Conformity and Community
10:17
with suspicion
10:19
why is this
10:21
well most of us want to self-realize to
10:25
be authentic we spend much of our time
10:27
crafting ourselves as projects to be
10:29
worked on hoping to uncover our true
10:32
selves and maybe even experience
10:34
self-actualization we value spontaneous
10:37
emotion something that is apparently
10:39
authentic and find ourselves skeptical
10:42
of behaviors and opinions that have been
10:44
formed in some way especially from
10:46
outside influence we are deeply
10:48
skeptical of Conformity and use terms
10:50
such as sheep or NPC to degrade those
10:53
who fail to be their own main character
10:55
most of all we strive to become who we
10:58
want to be
11:00
of course to do this one must be in
11:03
isolation as we're told the potential
11:06
imposition of others on one's life
11:08
Journey would be an abject failure in
11:10
being true to ourselves
11:12
how do you maintain isolation when so
11:15
much of your survival evidently depends
11:18
on others here money plays a crucial
11:21
role in affording such isolation as
11:23
pyeongchul Han writes money by itself
11:25
has an individualizing and isolating
11:28
effect it increases my individual
11:30
Freedom by liberating me from any
11:32
personal bonds with others I can have
11:34
someone else work for me by paying her
11:36
and this avoids entering into a personal
11:39
relationship
11:40
I don't need to form a deep relationship
11:42
with the Barista the farmer the banker
11:44
instead thanks to my noise canceling
11:46
headphones I can make sure all of my
11:48
basic needs are met without ever
11:50
personally knowing these fellow
11:52
terrestrials
11:53
my self-indulgent yoga practice can
11:56
continue because I can pay for food
11:57
delivery my journey to be who I want to
12:00
be is now left uninterrupted by human
12:02
interaction and this is largely thanks
12:04
to the exchange of money of course in
12:07
this beautifully symbiotic relationship
12:09
a capital and authenticity form a
12:12
feedback loop it's very marketable to be
12:15
unique and fully realized as an
12:17
individual and so we exploit ourselves
12:19
voluntarily in the belief that we are
12:21
realizing ourselves this of course
12:24
allows money to be accumulated and then
12:26
recirculated as Han explains in the cult
12:29
of authenticity the neoliberal regime
12:32
appropriates the person himself and
12:35
turns him into a highly efficient site
12:37
of production the whole person is
12:40
incorporated into the production process
12:42
we make money to self-actualize and we
12:45
self-actualize to make money our drive
12:47
for authenticity as heroic individuals
12:49
is very much tied up in our survival
12:53
regrettably this whole compulsion to be
12:55
individuals hasn't really made us any
12:57
happier pyang chilhan sees this
13:00
excessive relation to the self which is
13:02
incapable of leaving the self behind as
13:04
a wide-reaching narcissism we withdraw
13:07
into our little shells and the world
13:09
disappears circling around ourselves a
13:12
feeling of emptiness develops and we no
13:14
longer feel at home we become depressed
13:17
and this isn't just theoretical one 2021
13:20
meta-analysis found that across 14
13:22
different studies individualism was
13:25
consistently associated with reduced
13:27
life satisfaction and depression in
13:29
young people globally individualism has
13:32
increased over the last 50 years
13:33
alongside depression these authors posit
13:37
that in conclusion the modern social
13:39
environment is more competitive
13:41
inequitable and lonely this
13:43
deterioration of social cohesion among
13:46
modern industrialized populations may be
13:48
a central component to Rising rates of
13:50
depression
13:52
foreign
13:57
[Music]
14:02
overall in The Disappearance of rituals
14:05
Han points to this obsessive compulsion
14:07
to produce oneself as leading towards a
14:09
crisis of community and from this a
14:12
depressed and lonely world this is seen
14:15
in the end of ritual participation
14:17
rituals he writes make us feel at home
14:20
in the world they create resonant
14:22
relationships vertically to the gods to
14:25
space to time horizontally between
14:27
peoples and social communities and
14:29
diagonally with objects and things as he
14:33
argues without resonance we are thrown
14:34
back onto ourselves isolated increasing
14:37
narcissism works against the experience
14:39
of resonance
14:41
social media Echo Chambers for example
14:43
only lead to self-resonation where we
14:46
solely hear our own voices and opinions
14:48
this only strengthens The Echoes of the
14:51
self rituals on the other hand invite
14:53
the foreign and that which is different
14:55
thereby offering a stable space for
14:58
creativity and revolutionary potential
15:00
to flourish I'm sure the mention of
15:02
revolution has led to a few eye rolls
15:05
and by now I'm sure you can tell that
15:07
the subject of interconnectedness and my
15:10
criticism of capitalism leans in a
15:12
specific political Direction This is
15:14
perhaps best summed up by Terry
15:15
eagleton's distinction between socialism
15:18
and capitalism both systems taken at
15:21
their most utopian focus on human
15:23
flourishing as an end goal capitalism
15:26
sees competition the pursuit of
15:28
everyone's self-interest as the tool to
15:30
achieve this goal it is through
15:32
opposition to each other where we will
15:34
flourish socialism on the other hand
15:36
claims that human flourishing will come
15:38
not in opposition to each other but
15:39
rather through each other it is through
15:42
cooperation and sharing a common
15:44
interest that we create a better world
15:46
now has the necessary illusion of the
15:49
self and The Disappearance of rituals
15:51
paved the way for scientific innovation
15:53
greater material wealth and knowledge
15:55
undoubtedly yes but I would also argue
15:58
that this emphasis on solitary
16:00
self-realization has outworn its welcome
16:03
we are more depressed we are more lonely
16:06
we Face a revolving door of potential
16:08
Global catastrophes
16:11
or Multicultural globalized societies
16:14
are societies whose spirit is tired
16:17
unable to engage in a large-scale
16:19
passionate project which made demand
16:21
from us that we even risk Our Lives it's
16:24
a spiritual malaise a crisis of meaning
16:27
whatever you'd like to call it
16:29
one way of capturing this growing
16:31
despair is in terms of Mark Fisher's
16:33
hauntology and capitalist realism Fisher
16:36
argued that the Future Has effectively
16:38
been canceled and we find ourselves no
16:40
longer capable of imagining new Futures
16:43
this is evident in capitalist realism
16:45
where we can no longer imagine any
16:47
alternatives to our current economic
16:49
system it's simply impossible to imagine
16:52
a future without capitalism in some form
16:54
and Fisher was markedly aware of the
16:57
sorts of isolation that capitalism
16:59
encouraged the installation of
17:02
capitalist realism was by no means a
17:04
simple restoration of an Old State of
17:06
Affairs the mandatory individualism
17:08
imposed by neoliberalism was a new form
17:11
of individualism
17:17
[Music]
17:24
yes Fisher was kind of a bummer his work
17:28
is highly cynical of the future ahead
17:30
however Fisher did hold an idea of the
17:33
future that could counter this mandatory
17:35
individualism he believed that our
17:38
inability to imagine new Futures forces
17:40
us to look back in history to past ideas
17:43
of what the future could be revolution
17:46
then means not to generate new utopian
17:49
Visions but instead to unforget the
17:52
worlds that were previously imagined for
17:55
Fisher the most worthy adversary to our
17:57
present system is in the Psychedelic
18:00
movement of the 60s and 70s in
18:02
reflecting on psychedelia Fisher notes
18:05
its emphasis on interconnection and
18:07
Community it feels like an actual social
18:09
space one you can imagine really
18:11
existing you are as likely to come upon
18:14
a crank or a huckster as a poet support
18:16
musician here and who knows if today's
18:19
crank might turn out to be tomorrow's
18:21
genius it is also an egalitarian and
18:24
Democratic space and a certain affect
18:26
presides over everything there is
18:28
multiplicity but little sign of
18:30
resentment or malice it is a space for
18:33
Fellowship for meeting and talking as
18:36
much for having your mind blown from
18:39
this Fisher developed a vision of the
18:41
future he provocatively named acid
18:43
communism this Vision which Blended
18:45
class Consciousness feminism and
18:48
psychedelic thought under a communist
18:50
project was to function in opposition to
18:52
neoliberal individualism acid communism
18:55
promotes a breakdown of borders and
18:57
identity and a greater awareness for
19:00
just how connected we are and
19:02
importantly it appears very different
19:04
from what Fisher called the harsh
19:06
leninist superego the common communist
19:09
idea of individuals single-mindedly
19:11
dedicated to the Revolution and the use
19:13
of violence and suppression to achieve
19:15
said Revolution
19:16
in contrast to the dreary aesthetic of
19:19
past regimes Fisher put forth a vision
19:22
that celebrated interconnection and
19:24
coming together hence he emphasizes the
19:27
sort of Love found through psychoactive
19:29
substances rather than anger as a
19:31
motivating force in the revolution
19:33
evidently the use of psilocybin has been
19:36
linked to heightened empathy and
19:38
creativity as well as the sort of felt
19:40
connection with nature emphasized in
19:42
intervene this suggests that Collective
19:46
usage May promote a greater concern for
19:48
nature as well as one's relationships
19:50
with others and potentially even the
19:52
creative thinking that could surpass
19:54
capitalist realism of course the
19:56
promises of the 60s did not come to pass
19:58
which Fisher largely blames on
20:01
insufficient material conditions the
20:03
heavy regulation of these substances has
20:05
also played a role this is captured in
20:08
the words of Terence McKenna
20:10
psychedelics are illegal not because a
20:12
loving government is concerned that you
20:14
may jump out of a third story window
20:15
psychedelics are illegal because they
20:17
dissolve opinion structures and
20:20
culturally laid down models of behavior
20:22
and information processing they open you
20:24
up to the possibility that everything
20:26
you know is wrong
20:28
Fisher believes that we now have better
20:31
material conditions than the 60s but
20:33
also lack the sort of emotional and
20:35
existential conditions to bring about
20:37
this possible future the rigid
20:40
atomization of Our Lives has only left
20:42
us dejected from forming any sort of
20:44
movement the question remains as to
20:46
whether such a vision of acid communism
20:48
is even possible or if we have simply
20:50
given up on getting together if in the
20:54
words of juvenile we have lost the
20:56
reason to live for the sake of staying
20:58
alive
20:59
foreign
21:05
of course this video is just a
21:08
roundabout way of saying that love will
21:10
save us which isn't a very revolutionary
21:12
or unique statement but there's got to
21:14
be some level of Truth in its Simplicity
21:16
and Timeless appeal and evidently
21:19
healing the world through love holds
21:21
certain political implications it's a
21:23
recognition of interconnectedness and a
21:26
rejection of atomization it's a return
21:28
to rituals over our personal attempts at
21:31
self-realization and it's a Revival of
21:34
the optimism of 60 psychedelia over the
21:37
pessimism of capitalist realism
21:39
yes it holds a socialist bias but
21:42
importantly Fisher never imagines a
21:45
specific Utopia he does not claim that
21:47
such a Revolution Will manifest in
21:49
anything in particular what he is
21:51
concerned with is manifesting a certain
21:53
optimism and that's why I obviously
21:56
can't claim that a revolution will look
21:58
like this or like that but it's always
22:00
good to have an idea of where we could
22:02
shoot for
22:03
there is however perhaps one clear
22:06
objective to come out of this thesis to
22:09
recognize intervene is to be aware of
22:11
our entangled existence of not simply
22:14
living in the world but rather of being
22:16
at home in a shared world for whatever
22:19
reason most of our history has involved
22:22
trying to escape this fact through
22:24
visions of the afterlife and to Utopias
22:26
we have consistently sought salvation
22:28
beyond the Earth nowadays some of us use
22:32
their vast wealth in an attempt to fully
22:34
escape the dreaded connection with
22:36
others they wish to escape to other
22:39
planets or plunge themselves into
22:41
virtual reality they wish to be anywhere
22:44
but here and it is this observation that
22:47
concerns Bruno later after the lockdown
22:50
it is apparent that our common enemy
22:52
lies in those who see themselves
22:55
detached from the rest of us wretched
22:57
and entangled creatures locked down of
23:00
the World Unite you have the same
23:02
enemies the people
23:04
escape to another planet

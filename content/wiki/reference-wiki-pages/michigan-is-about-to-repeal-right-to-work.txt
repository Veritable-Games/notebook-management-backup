0:04
that Showdown raging in the heartland of
0:07
the United States perhaps no place in
0:09
America more closely associated with
0:11
unions than the state of Michigan and
0:14
today thousands of union workers
0:16
descended on the capitol to protest a
0:18
new law they believe could be an ominous
0:21
signal for unions and worker paychecks
0:23
everywhere that was the scene in 2012 as
0:27
Republicans in Michigan passed a vicious
0:29
anti-union law known as right to work
0:31
but now for the first time in 40 years
0:34
Democrats control Michigan state
0:36
government and they have a plan to put
0:38
power back in the hands of working
0:40
people I think that we've got to use our
0:42
moment that the voters have given us to
0:45
help support workers whenever we can
0:48
this is our chance to right or wrong
0:51
that state senator Darren camilleri he's
0:54
leading the charge to reverse
0:55
Republicans power grab for corporations
0:57
right to work like is that very missing
0:59
leadingly named law essentially is the
1:02
right to freeload makes it so that
1:04
workers at unionized companies don't
1:07
have to pay union dues but still get to
1:09
benefit from collective bargaining
1:10
agreements brought on by the unions to
1:13
do what they did 10 years ago behind
1:14
closed doors was devastating it you know
1:17
struck a chord with working people and
1:20
it's something that they've never
1:21
forgotten led by Governor Rick Snyder
1:23
Republican's goal was to labor
1:25
unions and make it harder for workers to
1:27
collectively bargain for better wages
1:29
benefits and working conditions and it
1:31
worked unions lost 40 000 members in the
1:34
last 10 years and wages stagnated so
1:37
what cut the power of working people
1:38
right it showed that corporations have
1:41
much more say than their workers and it
1:44
showed these exact workers all over the
1:46
state that the government cared more
1:48
about profits than it did about people
1:50
in a state that was once a stronghold of
1:52
organized labor how did corporations
1:55
gain the upper hand and can Democrats
1:57
actually put power back in the hands of
1:59
working people
2:00
we went to Michigan to find out
Right to Work History
2:06
to understand the current fight over
2:09
right to work we have to go back to the
2:10
New Deal
2:11
so in 1935 Congress passed the National
2:14
Labor Relations Act that was the first
2:17
national labor law that provided
2:20
protection to workers in the private
2:23
sector the right to organize and an
2:26
obligation on the part of the employer
2:29
to bargain a collective bargaining
2:31
agreement after the law was passed in
2:33
1935 elections were held across the
2:36
country in workplaces for workers to
2:39
choose a union and unions were winning
2:41
these elections at an extremely high
2:44
rate nearly 100 percent of the time
2:46
that's Robert Bruno a professor of Labor
2:48
history at the University of Illinois
2:50
and then in the 1940s the labor movement
2:54
began to expand its organizing into the
2:58
South and they were making significant
3:01
gains where they were organizing new
3:04
members in the Deep South places like
3:06
Texas for example as a result of that
3:11
growth of the labor movement there was a
3:13
movement generated by white supremacists
3:15
in the South connected to the business
3:17
community
3:18
who organized around the idea of passing
3:23
the so-called right to work laws to try
3:28
to stop the labor movement from
3:31
expanding into the South ultimately when
3:34
Republicans took control of the United
3:37
States Congress in 1946
3:40
high on their agenda was the passage of
3:43
a Right to Work bill known as the Taft
3:46
Hartley law while the taft-hartley ACT
3:48
cut off the rise of unions in the South
3:50
labor continued to flourish in northern
3:53
states especially in Michigan Michigan
3:55
was the home of the United Auto Workers
3:57
and it was the efforts of the United
4:00
Auto Workers in the 30s and the 40s and
4:03
beyond that really brought to life the
4:06
labor movement the union density in
4:09
Michigan you know at one point we were
4:10
38 Union I mean you know so every for
4:13
every 10 jobs there was almost 4 out of
4:15
10 reunions so so when I was a kid it
4:17
was a big deal it was you know people
4:19
knew about unions they understood it my
4:21
father was a firefighter he became a
4:24
union president for local 366.
4:27
they didn't have medical they didn't
4:30
have Optical they didn't have
4:32
hospitalization my father fought for
4:35
those and got them the union has got
4:38
Michigan to where they were at and then
4:41
in 2012 right to where it came to
4:43
Michigan
4:44
[Music]
4:45
there was no no hearing there were no
4:48
public availabilities they've passed the
4:51
entire thing in one day the governor
4:52
signed it behind closed doors because
4:55
they knew what they were doing was
4:56
incredibly unpopular the people of
4:58
Michigan did not want to see a change in
5:01
our workplace protections and our Union
5:02
protections the intent was really to
5:04
just weaken unions and by doing that you
5:07
really you're really weakening the
5:09
middle class Republicans sold right to
5:11
work as a way to attract new jobs and
5:13
businesses this can be good for economic
5:15
development for more and better jobs
5:16
coming to Michigan we've watched closely
5:19
what's going on in Indiana they've seen
5:21
many more companies look at Indiana
5:22
citing this as one of the factors the
5:24
fact they did it back in February and
5:26
they could have thousands more jobs in
5:28
that state because they became a right
5:29
to work state this has not been the case
5:32
instead workers have suffered as unions
5:35
struggled to attract new members we were
5:37
organizing we just got done organizing
5:39
five or six plants I mean we were we
5:42
were frankly kicking ass and then then
5:44
everything changed that day in December
5:47
of 2012. I mean it literally changed
5:50
everything when Michigan implements uh
5:53
right to work and weakens worker rights
5:56
in the state is you see a significant
5:59
reduction in the average earnings and a
6:02
significant reduction in the hourly wage
6:05
in comparison to states that are strong
6:09
worker right States you see a reduction
6:12
in the percentage of workers that have
6:15
employer paid Health Care poverty levels
6:18
were a bit higher in right to work
6:21
states like Michigan
6:24
fatality rates on the job fatality rates
6:27
work significantly higher in states that
6:32
pass right-to-work laws
Repeal Right to Work
6:36
but after 10 years workers have had
6:38
enough right now we get more calls than
6:40
we have ever had for people wanting to
6:42
organize and thanks to the support of
6:45
working people Democrats are back in
6:47
control of Michigan's government oh I
6:49
mean I think there's no Trifecta without
6:50
labor and in Michigan we haven't had a
6:52
trifecta in 40 years and in those 40
6:54
years we've been promising you know
6:56
better labor laws better protections for
6:58
workers we've just got to make sure that
6:59
we are in a position now with this new
7:01
power to deliver on the campaign
7:03
promises that we've made and one of
7:05
those in my instance is repealing the
7:07
anti-union right to work law Gretchen
7:09
Whitmer she said that she's going to
7:12
repeal this and I believe she will do I
7:15
think that she's going to help the
7:17
unions big time
7:19
I hope that we hold her feet to the fire
7:22
and make sure she does
7:26
Senator camilleri has introduced the
7:28
bill to repeal the right to work law we
7:30
are seeing a Resurgence of Union
7:31
activism not only here in Michigan but
7:34
everywhere in the country because we've
7:36
seen the power of what unions can do
7:37
they can help you get better wages they
7:39
can help you get better health care and
7:40
better benefits and uh folks would
7:42
prefer that right whether you're
7:44
somebody who works at Starbucks or
7:46
you're essentially having a conversation
7:47
at Amazon and some of the warehouses or
7:50
even places like Chipotle the economy
7:52
might look a little different but the
7:54
strength and the power of unions stays
7:57
the same already the bill is under
7:59
attack from corporate lobbyists and the
8:01
right-wing think tanks that they fund I
8:03
mean so far we've seen organizations uh
8:05
that are on the right wing of the right
8:07
wing Americans for Prosperity and a few
8:10
other groups like that that have started
8:11
their anti-campaign by all means you
8:14
know let the chamber attack me for
8:15
helping raise people's wages and
8:17
restoring their Pension funds if they
8:20
want to paint me as a bad guy for making
8:21
sure that working people can retire and
8:23
you know have a have a dignified life
8:26
have at it Michigan is on its way to
8:28
repealing right to work but in States
8:30
across the country workers need more
8:32
bargaining power not less if Michigan
8:35
succeeds it would be the first state to
8:37
repeal a right to work law in 60 years
8:40
it could set an example for other states
8:42
hoping to restore power to working
8:44
people
8:45

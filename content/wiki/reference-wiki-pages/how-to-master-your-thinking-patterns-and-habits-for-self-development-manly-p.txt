====== How to Master Your Thinking Patterns and Habits for Self Development - Manly P. Hall ======
0:03
well I'm happy to see so many of you have survived
0:11
we have an interesting subject this morning that it comes down to the daily living
0:18
of the things we believe I've often heard people get very
0:24
eloquent discussions on principles and ideals but many of them are still in trouble
0:30
themselves they are unable to escape from habit
0:35
patterns and from the traditional backgrounds from which we have all come in one way
0:42
or another I suppose that the present generation is
0:47
one of the most complicated in the history of humanity not only
0:52
is it complicated because the rapid advancements in various fields of
0:59
scientific progress but it is Complicated by a general
1:05
Revolution against tradition most people are blaming tradition
1:12
for the conditions that they are in today they feel that in some way
1:17
we were prevented from growing in the very early years of our culture
1:24
actually however most of the Traditions which have survived
1:29
have some foundation in facts and facts do not change easily or
1:36
readily or quickly and our general background of tradition
1:42
is essentially idealistic this means that a percentage of people
1:49
had strong convictions and lived by them or tried to this does not mean that all nations were
1:57
contrite and honorable it does not follow that all people have
2:03
ever United in any constructive Enterprise but there was an undercurrent a
2:09
foundation of integrities which are which this Foundation is at
2:15
this time especially unpleasant to contemplate we do not want to
2:22
re-establish the foundations of survival we do not believe any longer in the
2:30
golden rule we talk about it we write about it but when it comes in
2:36
conflict with personal interests we forget the traditional Integrity that is
2:43
at the basis of our civilization nearly every great teacher of the past
2:49
has brought us a traditional integrity they have all done their best to call to
2:56
our attention the realities of values in most instances some listen to them
3:05
in many cases they were persecuted and martyred
3:10
but out of it all came a lingerings stream of ideals that simply refused to
3:17
die and these ideals were the integrities upon which modern life has been built
3:25
but Integrity is often interfere with selfishness
3:31
they interfere with being exactly as free as we want to be
3:37
we were willing to fight and struggle desperately to get physical freedom
3:43
and most persons have achieved a considerable degree of it but this personal freedom has not been
3:51
brought under the censorship of integrities we feel that we can do anything we want
3:57
to but we do not curb integrate or educate the desire structure within ourselves
4:05
so today we are confronted by a complicated situation that is disturbing and
4:14
frightening millions of human beings According to some late statistics which
4:20
we have received the worldest year has increased its population by 82 Millions
4:28
looking forward into the future at a situation of this kind is very disturbing
4:34
because every year where populations increase sacrifices must be made
4:41
in order to maintain this increased population
4:47
each individual has to work a little harder gain a little less give a little more
4:54
and be more patient than he ever was before he is also going to find continual
5:01
encroachments upon all the materialistic values that he has become accustomed to
5:08
the greater the population the more each individual must give up
5:15
personal ambitions if he does not the entire structure will
5:20
fall apart everyone today is a little bit disturbed
5:26
some very much Disturbed by the complete collapse of our social
5:32
system as we know it the failure of a political system
5:37
the disabilities of our economic structure and the continual in danger to the
5:46
personal life of the individual so out of this comes anxiety
5:52
a continually increasing negative approach to circumstances
5:59
today there are probably more worriers than ever before in history
6:04
of course this is partly due to the fact there are more people than ever before in history
6:10
but the percentage of Warriors is increasing every day this hardly a day go by in which
6:17
individuals do not come face to face with what to them is solid proof
6:24
of the failure of their system of life this is something that is bound to cause
6:30
anxiety but we have to also realize that these happenings are not accidents
6:38
the problems we Face are the problems we have caused and the fact that they were caused by
6:45
our ancestors and that we may lead them to our descendants these do not alter the basic fact that
6:54
man is the cause of his own trouble trying to work with this situation
7:00
tells us very simply that the only cure for the problems that man causes is that
7:07
man stopped causing them he must in some way change his own
7:12
approach to existence of course the first thing that comes to
7:17
mind with this idea is that we must elect someone to do this for us
7:24
we must appoint someone to think for us and to have the authority to help other
7:32
people to see the light and at the same time leave our private interests alone
7:38
these must not be disturbed so we have today
7:43
a tremendous desire for some heroic personality
7:48
we would like to see the Skies open and the Holy Trinity take place as this is highly unlikely we are still
7:57
other problems and ways of approaching this situation admitting that we are living in the day
8:04
of the great headache the question is what are we going to do about it are we just simply going to
8:11
have one headache after another as long as we live now headaches due to worry anxiety
8:18
misunderstanding misinterpretation antagonisms of all kinds these headaches
8:25
unfortunately do not stay in the head they come out into other areas of Our
8:31
Lives this headache that we have this Grand
8:36
head problem that worries us is affecting every aspect of society
8:43
the warrior is already on the way toward being sick
8:48
now if worry was what was intended it would be unlikely that it would cause illness and be destructive to the human
8:56
being we must therefore assume that worry is not the answer worry is only a means of complicating
9:03
the difficulty so the problem of going around worrying
9:09
fretting stewing fearing everything that happens mistrusting everyone
9:15
and in a state of Perpetual criticism this apparently is not the answer
9:21
the proof of that is that it is solving nothing and making us sick
9:27
therefore we should begin to think in terms of how to act so that we will not
9:32
be sick the solution to the problem lies not only in our fears and anxieties but in
9:40
the solution of the causes of these fears and anxieties
9:45
it is useless to assume that the rest of humanity will agree with us on any subject
9:51
in fact it's hardly worthwhile trying to convert other people for just as surely
9:58
as we are trying to convert them they are determined to convert US so it just goes on and on and on
10:06
the only way we can stop worrying stop fearing stop hating
10:11
is to put a discipline upon ourselves we cannot prevent the world from
10:17
worrying but we can become detached from the worrying set
10:24
we can become self-sufficient to our own needs
10:29
this does not mean selfishness it does not mean that we are not mindful of the
10:35
problems of other people it does not mean that we will not do everything possible to assist others in
10:42
the solution of their problems but it means that before we help other people we must find an answer that will work
10:50
for ourselves there is really no use in simply sharing the worries
10:56
there is no use in trying to find new worries in everything that happens in
11:01
life no man has been given a faculty that is
11:07
probably unique in the world of nature he has memory
11:13
a magnificent equipment that enables him to build his own
11:18
solutions by remembrances of his own life history is collective memory biography
11:26
is individual memory and autobiography is the individual remembering the life
11:32
he himself is living now from the most fundamental and basic
11:38
experiences of his life he has been given the equipment to
11:43
estimate values weigh all things and cling to that which is good
11:49
in order to do these things he must shift his point of security
11:55
everyone wants security insecurity is the great measure of our time
12:00
it is the problem that we are all concerned with how can we find security
12:07
well it's obvious that the various patterns we are now following
12:13
these are not bringing security the individual today is trying to find
12:20
his Securities where it is not where these Securities have no factual
12:26
existence one of the most basic problems here is the emphasis upon wealth
12:34
most people are still convinced that if they have enough money they are safe
12:40
of course the depend it much depends on what they do with the money if they take it to Las Vegas they're not
12:47
safe also there are many Investments which are very tempting and will lead to loss
12:53
but essentially the individual feels that if his income and his economic
12:59
status is secure he has nothing to worry about
13:04
facts are against this conclusion for I've known a great many wealthy persons and probably most of you have
13:11
also known many who are more than comfortably fixed who are worrying worse
13:16
than anyone else they're worrying because their wealth has been destroying their children breaking down their homes
13:23
and making themselves sick So Physical Securities are not the
13:29
answer physical security is good if it's available but as a goal as an answer to the
13:37
Eternal problem it is a failure in the first place there is no way in
13:42
which everyone can be rich and as long as there are various levels
13:48
of Finance there will be conflict so money is not the answer to our
13:53
problem of security the next possibility seems to be intelligence
13:59
can we by some means or other think our way out of this dilemma
14:04
can the Mind solve it well the mind has been producing Solutions since the dawn of time
14:11
but these Solutions are interesting fascinating very tempting and can completely
14:19
take over the life of a person but these Solutions are not Solutions
14:25
all the mentality that we've had in the world up to the present time has been unable to cope with war with crime or
14:33
with poverty the Mind tries to find answers but every
14:38
answer the Mind finds and tries to apply comes face to face with obstacles that
14:45
the Mind cannot solve the truth of the matter is that the mind is an interesting fascinating bit of
14:52
equipment but it cannot correct the present existing circumstances
14:58
now the mind has given us a wide area of Sciences and philosophies with which to
15:05
cope with life the mind is made possible science but science is not solving anything
15:13
science gives us a cure for some minor ailment perhaps or even a major ailment
15:18
but in so doing hands to the world mechanisms which could destroy the entire human race
15:26
cyan says a very great weakness and that weakness is the failure of humanitarianism in the scientific
15:34
program science is concerned with knowledge it is using the mind to advance its own
15:41
purposes but when it comes to taking care of the Widow and the fatherless science is not
15:47
a great success other fields of learning the Arts are corrupted
15:53
all of the various elements of mental activity show problems
15:59
philosophy in our generation is virtually non-existent what we call philosophy is a higher
16:05
intellectual materialism our modern philosophies are based not upon ideals but upon material
16:13
institutions we send our young people to the universities and they have the Mind
16:19
strained they come back from the University and within a few years they're in trouble
16:25
even while they're in school they may be subjected to narcotics alcoholism and
16:31
other Corruptions therefore education has not been able to keep its own campus clean therefore
16:38
there is some question about it being able to solve the problems of mankind
16:43
so individuals looking all directions to try to find some answer to this very
16:49
pressing problem there's massive problems are rising from something
16:55
that must have a solution in the individual man will never be confronted with the problem he cannot solve
17:03
but he may be confronted with problems he will not solve because the solution Solutions are inconvenient
17:10
therefore we can come now to the next issue in the problem what is there that
17:16
the individual can cling to in this great stress of modern living
17:21
the first natural answer to this is religion but religion also is at a very serious
17:28
disadvantage religion presents us with abstract
17:33
virtues religion provides us with a concept of
17:39
an invisible causal universe beyond our perceptions
17:44
it also populates this universe with beings invisible to us
17:50
and the whole situation sums up in a very simple thought namely that religion
17:56
deals with things we cannot see and so-called materialism deals with
18:03
things we can see perfectly possible to see the house we
18:08
are building it is perfectly possible to count the shares of stock that we own
18:14
but it is not possible to actually factually estimate the nature of the
18:21
spiritual World in which we live this world is shut from us because we do
18:28
not possess the extra sensory perceptions necessary to make an
18:34
invisible spiritual cause of Life visible and tangible to our common
18:39
everyday living this place is all the advantage in the
18:45
hands of the materialist whatever he is doing you can see he can
18:50
see the Laboratories produce these experiments so we have facts Gatherings all the time
18:57
more and more facts and truths gradually disappearing
19:04
this means that there is a conflict between invisible principles
19:11
and visible policies and as long as this conflict exists the
19:18
individual is inevitably over influenced by the material policies
19:24
because he can see them because they are working in his life because they are directly the causes of
19:31
his worries they become the great entanglement
19:36
whereas the solution in principles and ideals this solution remains elusive intangible
19:45
and is greatly overlooked because it does not immediately prove itself to our
19:52
physical perceptions so with this situation constantly
19:58
undermining our faith it is very easy to become more and more
20:04
addicted to worry and less and less supported by principles which we cannot actually see
20:13
the result of course has been the gradual rise of a vast materialistic
20:18
culture in ancient times man looking for an answer to things
20:24
found no answer in the society around him there was no safety in his own cave
20:30
nor it was their safety in his relations with those in the caves around him
20:35
he was alone he was struggling against unknown factors and the material world was as yet an
20:43
unsolved mystery therefore because he knew very little about the physical Universe he still was
20:50
able to cling to the spiritual integrities of his tribal beliefs
20:55
as he knew more and more about the material world he became increasingly involved it
21:04
became a great mystery of Wonder it became a challenge and little by little
21:09
attention was focused upon physical circumstances
21:15
and the possibility of altering them the possibility of taking your neighbor's
21:20
cave and adding it to yours the possibility of accumulating wealth or
21:26
taking it away from someone else who had accumulated it all these things came as
21:31
man's knowledge of material things increased and little by little religion was we
21:40
will say transformed from a simple hope a simple statement of the reality of
21:47
things above material that material existence little by little religion was
21:53
theologized it was theologized in order that it might have a form or a shape a
22:01
dimension or a proportions that man could experience with his sensory perceptions
22:07
he could not understand the Magnificent Divine Universal house
22:12
the Magnificent Universe which was the symbol of the divine power
22:18
so so in order to make this invisible principle in some way tangible
22:25
Mortals began to build great Cathedrals temples shrines mosques they began to
22:32
create visible symbols of the invisible truths and persons who could not grasp of the
22:40
invisible principles gained gradually a sense of respect regard and admiration for the symbols of
22:49
these principles the systems of faith that came into the world the person who could not even for a
22:56
moment experience the divine presence felt something when he entered the
23:02
cathedral he found himself in the midst of a great Beauty a tremendous elevation of
23:08
Concepts and Consciousness he found himself surrounded by symbols of holy
23:14
living and holy thinking and gradually these symbols brought him to his knees
23:21
he became a willing to accept the invisible in the symbols which it had
23:26
projected from itself and which man had fashioned as a means of protecting the
23:32
worship of the deity which was his hope of salvation
23:38
so by degrees religion became embodied it took upon
23:44
itself the shape and proportion of the world in which it functioned it was one great philosopher of the past
23:52
said there is there is but one God but he has been worshiped under 72 names
24:00
now the 72 names began to get us into trouble also because people began to believe that
24:07
each name represented a different belief where the differences were largely those
24:12
of language and grammar and actually the same ideal abstract concept of deity was
24:19
present in all religions the important point is that gradually the world was filled with sanctuaries of
24:27
faith some still stand others are ruins some more will be built on and on a
24:34
certain type of human being will gain the strength of worship
24:40
by beholding the houses of his deities we're holding the works of other Pious
24:47
people as these works are exemplified in the stained glass windows and the mighty
24:53
arches and spans of cathedrals churches and temples so we have the interesting phenomenon a
25:02
man trying to make invisible things visible and achieving to a degree
25:09
but this degree isn't got him into another difficulties and these various institutions which he
25:16
created for the purpose of inwardly experiencing the Sublimity of God
25:22
gradually became involved in various theological complications
25:27
and these complications attempted to standardize men's beliefs to force them
25:34
to accept certain doctrines or policies regardless of their own internal
25:40
attitudes or concepts gradually therefore religion was
25:46
transformed into Theology and the priests of antiquity became the theologians of later times
25:53
these were individuals who were very largely dogmatic they served dogmatic
25:59
beliefs they serve certain attitudes they held certain convictions as
26:05
inevitable and absolute and gradually this descended to the time of the
26:13
universal Reformation so to say the relate religious Rebellion which brought
26:20
an end to the Medieval World after the Reformation religions and
26:26
Christendom began to break up more and more individual theologies came
26:31
into existence sect after sect rules each with its own peculiar Concepts and
26:38
beliefs and these sects ever since have been locked to a great degree at least
26:43
in an intense competitiveness and in the infinite belief that they are right and
26:50
that therefore others must Bend to them well this goes on until another
26:56
something came along and that was what we call the Age of Enlightenment the age
27:01
of humanism it was then gradually obvious that the public was resenting the dogmatics of
27:08
Theology and was therefore striving to liberate itself from the arbitrary
27:14
doctrines which were supported only by theological institutions
27:20
these doctrines gradually came into conflict with human interests and
27:25
attitudes as a result of this conflict we find finally the rise of Science and this at
27:34
the definite basic antagonism that developed between science and religion
27:39
in all its forms these are various changes came to the individual and in the 20th century find
27:47
the individual himself without any solid psychological religious spiritual or
27:55
even scientific support he comes into a world is dominated by
28:01
millions of persons each with ideas of their own which cannot be reconciled with the ideas of anyone else
28:07
therefore instead of having a solid Unity upon which to build something each
28:12
individual is under the pressure of a common dissimilarity everyone is trying
28:19
to do his thing in his own way and very often at the expense of other
28:25
people trying to do their things so here we are now in the closing years
28:31
of the 20th century and we are here with practically no
28:37
solid foundation under anything we are searching for various integrities
28:44
and it has been obvious for a long time that science is not going to solve the
28:50
problem of man's salvation if it is able to extend the length of life as it may hope to do it is only
28:57
going to give the individual more years in which to be miserable because it is not giving him any good reason for the
29:05
life he has it is not making his life here useful happy Pleasant and constructive
29:12
it goes on helping him to physically survive but it does nothing to make his survival
29:18
important or to make his survival useful to anyone the idea that he is going to be
29:24
remembered by his descendants is a vanity in itself just as certainly as we do not at this time at least have any
29:32
particular regard for our own ancestors it is all a problem of floating on the
29:39
surface of a of an unsolved mystery and in this condition
29:45
many persons just simply give up they just see no longer any reason for
29:52
anything yet within themselves they have the faculties necessary to discover the
29:58
reasons for almost everything but because of the traditional attitudes
30:04
because of the limitations of our educational system and the Corruptions of our economic and political structures
30:11
the individual has no moral support to try and improve himself
30:17
he feels that the only thing he can gain by going against the system is to end up
30:23
unemployed he does not find any solution to the
30:29
needs of his own inner life there are things he would like to do
30:34
but when he is actually given an opportunity to live according to the convictions he can't claims to have
30:41
these convictions don't fall apart he says he would live better under better circumstances but up to now there
30:50
have never been any circumstances sufficiently good to make the individual Live Well he thinks he's going to he thinks if his
30:58
worries are taken from him he'll be happy so he has some of them taken from him and now he's worrying because he hasn't
31:05
got the worries that's frightening him he thinks he must be failing in some way
31:10
if he doesn't realize the seriousness of the situation all these uh problems sort of gang up on
31:19
people they are not really prepared to handle them they've had no background of training
31:25
the education they have is virtually useful only to make a living not to make
31:31
a life actually we need a complete shakeup of the entire system
31:38
but when we think of shake up we think of Anarchy we think of some desperatism
31:43
taking over destroying our freedom and forcing us into a state of discipline of
31:49
some kind then we realize that this is also motivated by materialistic
31:55
ambitions we are not in a position to solve most of these situations
32:01
now with one thing we have to learn to do and that is to accept the complication
32:08
as it is we must stop dramatizing and emotionalizing it we must simply say
32:16
this is it this is the way it is and in all probabilities in most ways it
32:25
is going to stay this way for a while and it's going to probably stay here this way as long as we live
32:32
therefore we are going to be born into confusion we're going to struggle with it for our period of embodiment and
32:40
we're going to leave the confusion behind when we go we are not going to change all these
32:45
things instantly no matter how hard we try the we have our troubles in common but
32:53
our Solutions must be individuals the only way we can face this complex is
33:00
to gradually work out in ourselves an explanation of it a reason for it that
33:06
is sufficiently strong to enable us to live reasonably well and at the same
33:12
same time have a strong living realization of spiritual integrities
33:18
now this sounds very like a very difficult thing but after all this new world in which we
33:25
live is an Amphitheater of natural phenomena we are here in a world in which
33:31
everything is lawful or unlawful everything is cataloged classified and
33:38
controlled while we cannot for the moment perhaps see the hand of God in the things that
33:45
happen we do know that there are universal laws that are immutable we also know that in nature there are
33:54
principles which prove Beyond any doubt that a universal system does exist
34:00
and that this system has the means the knowledge the Consciousness the reality
34:07
to survive all of man's difficulties and also to transcend man's intentions to
34:16
destroy the system of which he is apart this system cannot be destroyed by man
34:23
this problem having been more or less sensed as we have to sense it we then
34:29
can say to ourselves we're in a mess why how are we going to get out of this mess
34:36
how are we going to achieve the things that are necessary are we going to achieve it by becoming
34:45
completely Disturbed discouraged and becoming alcoholics are we going to get any solution to
34:51
anything by narcotics are we going to make our world better for ourselves and other people by simply
34:59
walking out into the Wilderness somewhere and leaving everything else behind can we fulfill our destiny by taking
35:06
holy orders and Vanishing into a religious retreat can we actually accomplish anything by
35:13
walking up and down the street with a banner condemning other people we have all these attitudes
35:20
but none of them actually does anything to solve the problems of Our Lives
35:27
today we have more groups that are in activistic relationship with others that
35:34
are constantly parading that are constantly objecting and yet out of it all comes nothing but
35:40
a great headache why because this is not the answer it is not the way we were intended to do it
35:47
until we get down to facts and realize what is necessary there will be no
35:52
answer and when we get to the point where we appreciate the answer we realize that
35:58
all the misery we've had was well worthwhile that it was the only way that nature
36:04
could educate a wayward creation that is the only way that nature can
36:09
bring back to the prodigal children that it fashioned into realization of its
36:15
wisdom and its love is to allow these children to get either problems they
36:20
cannot endure any longer and to discover for once and for all that they cannot solve problems that are
36:27
greater than themselves if this begins to sort of trickle into
36:33
our consciousness then we begin to have the foundation not
36:39
a final solution but a foundation that will enable us to live the days of our
36:45
years in a comparative state of acceptance
36:50
not a not a an acceptance of the way things are
36:55
doubt but an acceptance of the necessity that mankind must pass through certain
37:01
experiences to outgrow his own ignorance the individual therefore can reach a
37:09
point in which he can live from day to day observing reflecting thinking
37:15
feeling studying doing everything he possibly can to understand the reason
37:21
for the situations as they are now and if he becomes more and more
37:26
concerned in finding reasons he will gradually rescue his mental and emotional complex from futility from the
37:34
belief that everything is wrong that there's no solution to anything and that he was born simply to suffer and die
37:41
he does not have to have these negative thoughts what he has to do instead of
37:47
giving up in despair is accepting the challenge of personal change
37:53
he must make certain adjustments in himself he was gradually released his energies
37:59
from Despair and despondency and focused them upon the understanding of life
38:06
the understanding of the way things must be in the way they should be and they will they will be regardless of what man
38:13
does if we can get to understand therefore that we are being disciplined
38:21
that the individual is being encouraged to correct his own mistakes and stop
38:27
making other similar mistakes he will then perhaps have more energy for a solution there's a lot of work to
38:35
be done in this world there is a great need of United effort but nearly always
38:41
despondency Neurosis pessimism all of these negative attitudes impoverish the
38:49
resources of the person himself when he finally centers his mind upon
38:55
futility he will find it everywhere he will become more and more futile in
39:02
everything that he does he will become discouraged he will believe firmly that this world is of no
39:08
value and he begins despondent enough he may even contemplate suicide
39:14
but with all this contemplation and all this negation nothing has been accomplished except the disintegration
39:21
of a personal existence taking this point as a basis then of
39:28
something to do that is at a different point of activity the individual should
39:35
begin to try to observe the working of universal law in the various occurrences
39:42
of his life he must begin to see reasons for things which he now regards as merely miseries
39:50
he must begin to realize that he lives in a world of lawful procedures and that
39:57
he must abide by them now on some levels we're beginning to get a little wiser
40:03
but up as to now it hasn't been considered a general Improvement
40:08
one of the fields in which we seem to be getting a little smarter at least is
40:13
nutrition we have discovered finally what we should have known always but which we
40:20
didn't need to know until we broke the rules namely that nutrition is a very
40:27
important factor in life that it cannot be ignored that the individual who
40:33
wishes to have better health must concentrate his attention upon learning
40:39
how to have better health he will study the problems of nutrition
40:44
in himself he must discover his own mistakes due to appetites he must
40:51
discover why he cannot do just what he pleases and at the same time maintain
40:57
bodily health so here we'll come face to face with facts and we're gradually beginning to
41:03
face them with more or less conscious intelligence now our out our mental life is also in
41:11
constant need of nutritional education what we take into the mind
41:17
as a phase of our nutritional problem if we take in the wrong thoughts we're
41:24
going to be just as bad off mentally and physically as we would be if we eat food that is
41:31
improper to our needs the individual can be allergic to attitudes and everyone more or less
41:39
is allergic to negative thinking it will never help him and it will
41:45
almost certainly hurt him now this doesn't mean he won't live through it he may have negative thoughts
41:51
all his life and pass the century mark but he will simply have extended the period of disappointments
41:57
disillusionments and disasters for himself therefore with Nutrition a very fact
42:04
factual thing the individual has a mental life that needs to be disciplined
42:11
and needs to be subject to the laws of mental nutrition
42:17
he breaks these laws every day in front of his television or he breaks in every
42:22
day in the various activities which he considers essential he takes in a constant stream of bad
42:31
food he takes in food that is not only indigestible but in many cases it is
42:39
hopelessly poisonous he does the same thing mentally and
42:45
physically if he takes in contaminated mental food he is going to be safe
42:50
and most of the mental conditions of our society lead to a problem of
42:56
contaminated thinking you know the person doesn't have to take this on
43:02
he can live in the midst of it but he does not have to become contaminated there's no law that says that it has
43:10
been absolutely necessary inevitable or irrevocable that an individual has to
43:16
become an alcoholic there is no reason given by heaven or Earth why an alcoholic has to drive a
43:23
car under the influence of alcohol these are things we do ourselves
43:28
and our worries are just as futile and useless as these other habits
43:35
we have no law that says we have to be frightened
43:40
we now have no law that says that we have to have a world that does what we
43:46
please it to do or otherwise we will be miserable there is no law that says we have to be
43:53
happily married or have pleasant relatives or obedient children these
43:59
factors do not exist as inevitable necessities therefore we cannot resent or reject the
44:07
opposite when it comes along but every one of these relationship has
44:12
lessons everything has something to learn we are not only indebted to our families
44:20
for a great deal of valuable knowledge but our children are indebted to us for inevitable truths all these things are
44:29
common necessities of life we can reject them we can allow Prejudice and criticism and
44:37
condemnation to destroy all of the integrities of relationships but this is not because it
44:44
is necessary it is because we have chosen to do it that way
44:50
we have had our personal conceits rebuked in some way and we can never
44:55
forgive the person who did it our relatives do not do what we expect them to therefore we won't speak to them
45:02
again it all lies in our own situation none of the problems that face Us in in
45:10
our personal lives can remain completely unchanged if we
45:17
determine to change them there are responsibilities which we may
45:22
not be able to dispose of but we can transmute them into opportunities
45:28
we can do anything we want with the problems of the day if we will
45:34
place inside of ourselves ourselves a major Rod a ruler by means of which we
45:43
can measure the things that happen in daily life one of the situations that we all have
45:51
to face today is on unemployment and all of the relations to it we have to
45:58
sometimes give up many luxuries that we have come to consider to be this indispensable
46:04
many persons are unable to give up anything without falling apart yet these same persons when they pass on
46:11
must give up everything and do nothing more than accept the fact
46:16
everything in life can be understood reevaluated and accommodated to if we
46:26
really wish to make the effort therefore if we are good Warriors as
46:32
most people are these days we should take some of these worries and see what we can do about them to see how we can
46:39
change our own thinking our own relation to them and recognize that a problem is
46:46
a challenge not a disaster now we cannot always make us all the
46:52
problem but the moment we come against a problem we can't solve
46:57
This is highly educational in itself the fact that we can't solve some common
47:04
human problem may just be a proof of that we are not infallible
47:10
which is a discouraging Discovery to make because we wish to assume that whatever
47:15
is necessary we know it whatever we should be doing we do it
47:21
and he'll suddenly wake up and find that we are not getting anywhere with our own
47:26
infallibility can be one of the most important lessons that we will ever learn in this world it suddenly gives us
47:33
the opportunity to recognize that what we consider to be the proof of our
47:40
wisdom is merely perhaps only the pressure of our own egos determining
47:45
what we're going to do so we can begin to find out for instance
47:50
that our advice isn't always good if our advice isn't good why
47:56
is it because we've had no opportunity to learn is it that our own lives have in so
48:03
instituted that we are giving advice based entirely upon personal experience
48:09
what is the reason why our advice is worthless Our advice is usually worthless because
48:16
we have not actually learned any of the lessons of life that would make our
48:21
advice significant the individual who has suffered much and
48:26
come through it and can give advice the individual who has suffered little and
48:32
is sorry for himself all his life has very little to contribute to human problems
48:37
so it's a matter of gradually gaining an integration within yourself
48:44
and this integration begins with one basic conviction for the universe is right
48:50
the things that happen happen because they must happen and it must happen because the law of
48:57
cause and effect is immutable and yet this law never was and never
49:02
will be a tyrant the law is not something that is punishing you unjustly or taking away
49:08
from you things you deserve the law of cause and effect is reminding
49:13
you whatever that you want in life that is worthwhile you have to deserve
49:20
you have to earn happiness you have to earn security
49:25
not in the terms of a business venture but in terms of internal acceptance of
49:30
value we all come into this world with really with nothing
49:36
we even have a body that for a long time is much help to us we live a while four school years
49:42
perhaps if we're lucky and then we leave this world and we leave it with nothing at all except what we have developed
49:51
within our own consciousness if there's anything that survives it's the soul and the inner life enriched by
49:59
good works and by understanding and insight other things are useless
50:05
if we die of a broken heart because we can't take physical wealth with us we
50:10
are really at a very impoverished condition and if we leave great wealth to our descendants we are likely to be
50:16
doing them a great harm so nature in its own quiet way
50:22
can give us the Securities we need let's look around ourselves for a while
50:28
and in other people try to see the consequences of attitudes
50:34
try to see who among the people we know is perhaps the most happy
50:40
if we know one individual or two or three individuals who out of a good lifetime of years and experience are
50:48
still strong in faith who still are able to rise above the
50:54
emergencies of living for later years face the future with peace and calm of spirit
51:01
what have these people that we do not have and we'll generally find out that it is
51:08
a disposition that is based upon constructive reactions to circumstances
51:15
these people are not the ones who never suffered but these are the persons to whom
51:20
suffering was a maturing power for power not a rotting one
51:26
we will also find that most of the people who are happy in this world are
51:31
satisfied with little cherish the things that they do enjoy
51:37
with great quiet dudes with patience with understanding with gratitude
51:44
these people are grateful for small mercies we are ungrateful with great blessings
51:51
therefore our lives are not as theirs are as the years go on
51:57
we can find in this world a great many persons whose conditions are no better
52:03
than our own but whose attitudes are remarkably better and this gives us the realization that
52:10
ours can be bettered also we are not born pessimists we have to
52:16
train ourselves to be a pessimist we have to gradually eliminate our life from our lives everything that is good
52:23
and we almost always have to blame someone else for the tragedy because very few people want to accept
52:29
the fact that they are wrecking their own lives so out of a little thoughtfulness comes
52:36
the possibility of the person gaining a stability in this period of stress which
52:43
is the thing we all want much concerned with and we will find ultimately that no
52:48
change in our outward circumstances will produce this stability
52:54
we can move into a smaller house it may help we can move into a larger one which will
53:00
gratify certain Ambitions and bring with it more responsibilities than we can carry
53:05
we can do all kinds of physical things trying to find that peace that the world
53:11
is seeking but it will still be elusive because everything that is physical is
53:17
transitory and the only thing that is not transitory in man is his own soul
53:22
and this is the thing which he must educate he must release in the manifestation and he must serve with
53:30
fullness of heart and mind so if you finally decide to do something
53:35
about it begin the cultivation of constructive living and thinking
53:42
let the mind be concerned with something that is not worldly
53:48
now many things have come along that people have found to be very helpful in
53:54
the studying of their emotional lives service to other people is a
54:00
tremendously remedying factor to forget our own needs our own wishes our own
54:06
desires to help persons less fortunate than ourselves has one great virtue it
54:13
takes our minds off of ourselves and it is the individual with his mind
54:18
locked on himself who is in the deepest trouble then there are all kinds of constructive
54:24
attitudes the individual can begin educating his life and in most persons the education of his
54:31
life will involve and must involve some religious insights
54:37
now religion is a very personal thing religion is a relationship between the
54:42
individual and the divine power behind and within himself when it is viewed this way it is called
54:49
mysticism for mysticism is the belief in the immediate possibility of direct
54:54
contact with the divine it does not require intermediaries he
55:00
does not require that the individual will follow the concepts or traditions of other persons it means that through
55:07
the natural expression of internal integrities the individual penetrates
55:13
into the core of himself and receives virtue and refreshment from that power
55:19
which lies at the root of his own nature this means of course that uh the calming
55:26
of the Mind is of the greatest importance the individual who is constantly
55:32
agitating His Thoughts with negative attitudes is not going to have this calmness
55:38
but quiet dudes which was of course the basic religious concept of what were
55:44
called the quietest which included the friends and the Quakers and a number of Oriental sects this quietude
55:52
in an expression of the term be still and know that I am God
55:58
who instead of worrying the Stillness helps Stillness is not an escape from worry
56:05
it is an internal realization that there is something deeper more
56:11
valuable more useful and more beneficial than worried it is worrying that is locking us away
56:18
from our own inner lives all the criticism and condemnation and
56:24
irritation no matter how much we believe it to be deserved is simply cutting out our own internal
56:32
experience the more we fix upon outside problems
56:37
the less time and energy we have to release internal strength
56:44
so the one of the simplest things that the warrior can try to do if he is of
56:49
Soul minded is to take on interests that break in on the worry pattern doing
56:55
things that are maybe not important physically but are very important as
57:01
release of understanding and insight the studies of arts and crafts the
57:06
experience of doing things with the hands is very these are very valuable to
57:11
the person whose mind is troubled all the time the individual cannot divide his
57:18
energies equally on two different levels simultaneously therefore if you can't do anything
57:24
better where the times get pressure full just sit back quietly and knit
57:29
anything to use a power to separate the person
57:35
from negative thinking if you have to keep your mind on something else
57:42
this helps poetry is of a good nature is a great help in these uh Pursuits a very
57:50
fine inspirational literature can help not necessarily have highly Advanced
57:55
intellectual study of the universe but simply gentle quietude
58:01
storms that reach into the heart of things they bring gentle messages of
58:06
peace and Contrition to the tired person but whatever it is gradually educate
58:12
your mind until you are able to tell it I want you to see the good in things
58:18
I want you to observe progress and seeing the good in things we do not
58:25
want the mind to find good in the things that have never been any good we do not want the mind to go back to
58:32
its old habits to see the good in things for the average person is to realize
58:38
that an experience is Meaningful and that out of the things that happen we grow
58:45
a misfortune is not a blight upon us but a challenge Upon Our resources
58:52
to accept the challenge of growth we must avoid the tendency to try to
58:58
escape growth by economic means or by travel or by change which has no direct bearing upon
59:06
the facts if you can achieve a certain amount of Peace within your own nature you can
59:13
then begin to re-educate yourself it may take some time because you may not be
59:18
able to just re-educate everything at once because you may have to re-educate
59:24
your background back three or four generations to get at the root of some of it your families have been made up of
59:31
Warriors everyone has struggled for something that he either didn't get or lost afterwards or perhaps even more
59:39
often got it and no longer wanted it these things you have to work out in
59:44
your own life in childhood in education in marriage in relationship with life business children and everything we have
59:52
been taught to be concerned in the sense of being irritated
59:57
we have been taught to be critical we have been taught to dislike rather than
1:00:03
accept the major occurrences of existence we consider change a disaster when no
1:00:11
change can be the worst disaster of all so with these Concepts basically working
1:00:17
in US we must try for the beginning of security and that is a quiet
1:00:25
perspective relationship with life when something happens that for the last 50
1:00:31
years has caused us to be angry it's not the best thing to do is to take
1:00:36
a deep breath relax and keep quiet instead of answering back and starting
1:00:41
an argument that might go far enough to break a home just say nothing
1:00:46
very quietly let the thing die without adding anything to it
1:00:52
try never to put salt into an open wound never try to argue faster or better than
1:01:01
somebody else that is how Wars are made are people out arguing each other
1:01:07
nations out arguing each other each one certain that its ideas are the best and
1:01:13
the other one is wrong so under doubt be still
1:01:18
and in the being of Stillness and in the quietude of a complete detachment
1:01:25
try to understand what is really meant what is all involved in this entire
1:01:30
problem who is right who is wrong what is the meaning of the occurrence itself
1:01:37
little by little if you do it this way things become symbols of value
1:01:44
instead of symbols of loss by degrees the individual can gain great
1:01:51
insights from the quiet acceptance of life he can also observe the
1:01:57
consequences come to people who are not self-controlled you can see how the
1:02:02
argument leads to another tragedy you can see how people walk out on each other over trivia and why children leave
1:02:10
home and get into drift difficulties and perhaps ruin their lives
1:02:15
now each person in his own way thinks that somebody else's fault that these
1:02:21
are ungrateful children that these are children who do not appreciate values and securities but the person then says
1:02:29
what securities did I give them did I give them three meals a day send
1:02:34
them to school and start them off did I give them any moral or
1:02:40
philosophical insight did I simply scold them when they didn't do what I expected them to or if they
1:02:47
had a fault of some kind did I punish them was there anything in my relationship with these children to inspire them to
1:02:55
search within themselves for greater values did I give them a spiritual Foundation
1:03:00
of integrities did I prove to them through my own conduct that my security was based upon
1:03:07
integrity if all of these or most of these things were lacking the mere fact that we
1:03:14
supplied them with all the physical necessities of life still leaves us with a tremendous unmet
1:03:21
responsibility and this is true in almost every Walk of Life that we in we bring people things
1:03:28
but we do not help them to establish foundations that will endure
1:03:35
the day we are looking perhaps isn't not for some time in the past for a better
1:03:41
religious values all around we have finding new groups of
1:03:46
people and old groups also that are beginning to come back to Faith
1:03:52
now some of these uh in some of these countries where religion is in trouble particular trouble
1:03:59
the faith itself is a tremendous Factor even though politically these countries
1:04:05
may not be allowed full religious freedoms they cannot be taken away from
1:04:11
the individual's internal life there is no degree of persecution
1:04:18
that can prevent the individual from his internal acceptance of realities
1:04:24
he may not be able to expound them to other people if he tries to preach them he may find
1:04:30
himself in prison or in worse situation but there is no reason in the world and
1:04:36
no power on Earth that can prevent the individual from living on a level of personal integrities
1:04:44
he can do whatever is the unpleasant task but he can do it with an
1:04:50
understanding of why and that out of persecution out of all
1:04:55
of the difficulties they've reset him he is gaining the strength to stand about
1:05:01
all of the problems that he has previously considered insurmountable
1:05:07
so we know that it does work another thing that is very important in
1:05:12
this problem is to maintain some type of regular religious
1:05:21
relationship with life and most of the time we attribute this
1:05:26
to church Gathering we think that the individual should join the church should attend services and
1:05:33
perhaps send children to the Sunday School but this is again a physical
1:05:39
solution to a mystical problem I think every churchgoer should give
1:05:45
great thought so how he acts on the six days a week that he doesn't go to church
1:05:52
this is the problem is he able to gradually maintain a
1:05:58
higher level of religious Integrity in his daily happenings is he able to live every day of his life
1:06:06
some principle that he has learned from his religion
1:06:11
is he setting an example to other members of his family is he doing the
1:06:16
things that prove the sincerity of his religious commitment the commitment that simply is fulfilled
1:06:24
by a donation or fulfilled by attendance and public worship is not enough
1:06:30
it is something else entirely it is the individual's own internal uh acceptance
1:06:38
of a Divine principle now unfortunately most of our principal religions of today
1:06:45
do not give adequate training on what constitutes the real objects of religion
1:06:52
uh many religions simply tell us that we should fear God others that we should love God
1:07:00
but both of these terms are extremely abstract they're very hard to understand
1:07:07
but we all have to understand every day is that religion all real religion of
1:07:13
every denomination is a way of conduct and it's the conduct is inconsistent
1:07:19
with the Creed the situation is out of order therefore religion in all matters is to
1:07:26
have a constructive relationship with life religion is the power of the individual
1:07:33
to see God or good in the occurrences of his daily existence
1:07:40
it is necessary for the person if he is truly religious to become very grateful
1:07:48
for the Privileges that are given to him in life instead of constantly beseeching deity
1:07:54
to take from him the proper responsibilities which are his own religion is better a veneration
1:08:01
acceptance and service of that which is known to be superior
1:08:07
therefore gratitude for the Divine privileges is more important than
1:08:13
fussing over the human emergencies we are here by a wonderful rule a law
1:08:20
that has gone on for millions of years we are the product of life that has been
1:08:26
unfolding for con counted millennia we are here because we are unfolding a
1:08:33
Divine spark within ourselves every noble beautiful and wonderful deed
1:08:39
that we perform is part of a release of the Eternal God within us every bit of
1:08:46
complaint locks that God further into darkness the individual who does not see
1:08:52
God in which what is happening to him will not find deity at all and deity is a presence challenging it
1:09:01
is causing the individual to call upon his spiritual resources if he believes
1:09:07
in peace religion calls upon him to keep the peace if he believes in integrities
1:09:14
religion demands that he lives them every day now of course sometimes it appears to be
1:09:21
martyrdom but for the most part we can still do a great deal more than we have
1:09:27
done and our first emotion in life should not be a criticism of other people or
1:09:34
criticism of circumstances but gratitude for the privilege of learning the
1:09:40
privilege of being here to face problems and solve them the problem and privilege to live above
1:09:47
disasters and catastrophes and finally to recognize the divine power and the
1:09:53
infinite love that rules all things the most most critics have just
1:09:58
forgotten that deity is love they have forgotten that the things they don't like are practical evidence of
1:10:06
divine love if the if the Divine Spirit was not all
1:10:12
loving as well as always it would permit individuals to make mistakes On and On
1:10:18
Through the Ages until they completely eliminated themselves it would enable all that is evil to
1:10:24
Triumph forever all that the selfishness and littleness of the human being would
1:10:29
become the standard of all relationships this is not true actually that which loveth most is that
1:10:37
which chastise it that which finds ways to correct mistakes before they become
1:10:44
impossible so as you start out in the day or in any
1:10:50
part of your life with a negative attitude on things with a kind of a glum look and with a quite definite certainty
1:10:58
that everything is going to the dogs it is much better to be quiet and try to
1:11:03
say where is the lesson where is the truth in this thing what is it that I can do
1:11:10
to make sure that my faith is stronger than the emergencies of living
1:11:17
how can the individual prove to himself that his inner resources can carry him
1:11:23
through any emergency that arises in his life there are no emergencies really sickness
1:11:30
death and not emergencies that which is an emergency is when an
1:11:36
individual makes a bad decision this is an emergency it is because he has
1:11:41
forgotten the principles upon which his life should be built built all the things natural and not emergencies
1:11:48
it is not an emergency that we grow older it is not emergency that we have to give
1:11:55
up certain Privileges and opportunities as years go by everything is that as we grow older we
1:12:02
have the right to live according to a longer perspective of experience
1:12:08
we can make decisions that the young have not yet the power to make but in
1:12:13
every part of life youth age all periods we are living within a pattern of Divine
1:12:19
Purpose if we can get this thought sort of fixed in our minds we will not be so
1:12:25
given to all the worries and excitements that come along
1:12:31
we are worried today over economics we always will be and always have been as long as we worship economics as long as
1:12:38
you make the dollar deity we are going to be out worshiping the golden calf and we will be always in trouble
1:12:46
if we make our life built upon achievement in the same expense of
1:12:51
ambition and this ambition causes us to be untrue or unkind or unreasonable
1:12:57
we may attain the ambition and at the same time have a stroke or a coronary
1:13:03
because nature doesn't want it that way nature doesn't want the individual to
1:13:08
live for ambition alone he won't seem to live individual to have a little
1:13:13
ambition and a great deal of aspiration this is much better aspiration means to
1:13:19
become more ambition means to accumulate more and the more we become the less
1:13:25
dependent we become a fun accumulation until it is no longer a serious
1:13:31
emergency with us then there are persons who cannot live or cannot believe they are happy unless
1:13:38
they are dominating somebody else the anyone whom we dominate we must
1:13:43
accept the consequences of our own domination of them we must take upon ourselves the karma
1:13:50
that we have imposed upon other people by trying to live their lives for them and this is especially true if in trying
1:13:58
to live our their lives we are simply demanding that they accept our mistakes
1:14:04
little by little we have to learn all these principles they add up to a quite
1:14:10
kindly thoughtful relationship a relationship in which we are here to
1:14:16
become more and more aware of the infinite good in which we exist a good
1:14:23
which we are spoiling and dispoiling ourselves a good which we were forbidding to have
1:14:30
happened because of the fact of our personal Ambitions and attitudes
1:14:37
as long as the individual lives as a rugged individual he will end up as a
1:14:43
ragged individual there is no other way as long as we put a career ahead of
1:14:49
everything else and consider success in terms of monopolistic achievements
1:14:56
we are breaking the rules and if we break the rules long enough the rules will break us
1:15:03
there is no way in which we can do right and spell there's no way in which we can
1:15:09
do wrong and succeed in this emergency of the 20th century
1:15:16
ultimately the thing that is going to happen has to happen is that the Tower of Babel that we ourselves have built is
1:15:23
going to fall down but this does not mean it will carry us to Oblivion in one terrible experience
1:15:30
it simply means that the individual will be faced with restoring or
1:15:36
reconstructing a world which he has has destroyed or devastated by his own false
1:15:43
attitudes suppose you have been an alcoholic for 20 years and suddenly decide to get over it
1:15:50
now he's going to take an awful lot of willpower to do it it is also going to take considerable personal suffering and
1:15:58
it may be that you'll have to be hospitalized for some sometime to get rid of the pressure of this destructive
1:16:04
habit now the world so to say is an alcoholic and that can be more literal than we
1:16:10
might think because alcoholism is a blight upon the whole surface of the Earth
1:16:16
but also alcoholism is a symbol of a way of life it is a habit forming symbol of man's
1:16:24
selfishness it is part of a grand pattern in which everything we have done everything we
1:16:31
have thought about everything we have lived for has been dominated by self-interest it has been dominated not by the law of
1:16:38
what we should do but the law of what we want to do and will do regardless of consequences the only part about it
1:16:45
that's uncomfortable is the consequences but they are there and they always will be there and no one will ever be able to
1:16:52
get rid of them so we are if we are in a badly habit if
1:16:58
our world for several thousand years have been doing it wrong this will never for one moment change
1:17:03
the fact that it is wrong there's no possible way in which we can cultivate so many vices that anyone or
1:17:11
all of them can become virtues if the trouble stays the same
1:17:16
nothing changes no matter how much legislation we make how many rules we make or how many of our contemporaries
1:17:23
make the same mistakes the mistake is a mistake to Infinity it will never be changed the only way to
1:17:31
get over the mistake is to correct it now with this type of thinking we can
1:17:37
sort of relax a little bit I think we can do it from day to day trying to
1:17:42
be what we were supposed to be kindly well-intentioned
1:17:48
humanitarian persons with as much Mutual affection for each other as is possible
1:17:54
for those who know very little about each other but to kindliness and fraternity and
1:18:00
cooperation to a constant searching for something that is truly better
1:18:06
and realizing that the successful life is a life dedicated to service and not
1:18:12
getting dedicated to accumulation as we go along like that we can smooth
1:18:17
out a lot of this worry fear all this hatred all this uh struggle
1:18:24
which means people come by the thousands to seek help from Physicians mentalists
1:18:31
psychiatrists and all types of Healers simply because they cannot live with
1:18:36
themselves they have allowed their personal feelings to make them so sick that they
1:18:42
are on the verge of a complete psychological disintegration now there's nothing out of those people
1:18:49
except their own minds if they can change their attitudes and their thinking they can be just as happy
1:18:56
as they are now miserable they can be much wiser also because they will
1:19:01
discover that the causes of misery are their own mistakes they stop making the mistakes they will
1:19:08
be happy not happy may be in the sense of the of riotous living not happy in a sense of
1:19:15
going out and expending fortunes on luxuries but happy in a quiet peaceful
1:19:21
relationship itself happiness which is the happiness of the normal person regardless of his economic
1:19:28
estate a happiness that comes from good work from being busy from doing our share of
1:19:33
the world's labor for doing honest measure for whatever we are remunerated
1:19:39
and doing everything as nearly as we can as we would like to believe that God
1:19:45
wants it done that we will try always to keep not only the laws of man but the laws behind the
1:19:54
laws the Eternal laws that never change if we can do this I think we can find a
1:20:00
certain amount of strength over whatever has going to happen what we do what we are not aware of we
1:20:08
can't plan for exactly but if everything we know today is Swept
1:20:14
Away we lose really nothing because actually one moment of the heart
1:20:20
stopped and we've lost it all anyway therefore nothing of a material nature
1:20:26
is permanent whether we lose it now or on the death day makes very little essential
1:20:31
difference the league the thing that makes the real difference is whether while we are living we can
1:20:38
use things without abusing them that we can have or not have and regardless of
1:20:45
our material estate keep Faith with principles upon which the world's survival depends
1:20:51
it's always therefore not much use to get all worked up over things rather it
1:20:57
is better to prove that we are good Christian people that we are good religious people that we are devouting
1:21:04
our insights and dedications by living a quiet life and shedding and
1:21:11
spreading around us only confidence that whatever person we meet we will not
1:21:16
build up their negative thinking but will encourage them as far as we can to
1:21:22
find the truth behind their own actions we may not succeed but at least we will
1:21:28
not build up their troubles by adding more negative thinking to theirs
1:21:34
is they have to live only with their own negative thinking it's bad enough but if they have to live with our pile of it
1:21:40
that we put on them it's still worse so the best thing to do is to try always
1:21:45
to be peaceful and constructive and find the good in the thing as it is
1:21:52
find the lesson it is teaching us find a way of superior existence which
1:21:57
it is pointing to and that it all accompanied by the very simple fact that the more we serve the
1:22:05
ego the worse off we'll be but the more we serve the soul that lies within and
1:22:11
which isn't the God within us the more we will come into the peace and happiness of realization and final
1:22:19
infinite adjustments to the plan of which we are apart we find all by peace we find all by
1:22:28
quietude and we find nothing but trouble by fear
1:22:34
well I guess that's awful
1:22:43
[Applause]

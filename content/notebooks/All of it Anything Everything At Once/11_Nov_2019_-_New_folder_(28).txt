====== REC001.txt ======
When I get back inside, my goal is to continue working on the map.
I'm really tempted to dig into the bits of recording, so I've made over the last couple months, weeks.
Jesus, I'm going to make my process. I haven't even given three months yet.
Oh my god, I can't imagine where I'll be in like a year. I can keep going on like this.
Just over in your cell phone.
But I turn you guys right now, it's eventually.

and we're gonna have this a brightness thing and this thing


====== REC003.txt ======
Okay, so


====== REC004.txt ======
Get a train mattress
Not a train mattress


====== REC005.txt ======
get a giant bean bag for the bedroom, or see at a cost through the size and the usage,
and then get a firm padding to place above it, a fractured rest.
It's not for relaxing sofa place, and then you put a little boarding on there.
Maybe you're fine just digging the burring into the mat, the seat bag, and just get it careful about the way my neck is supported.
It's like a pillow.
Several pillows.

====== REC009.txt ======
The shell world opens up from the center.
So from the horizon you see this immense amount of the line.
As the top shell of the planet rises up,
the bottom goes down.
It moves over to encapsulate the world and
attaching on to the atlas pillars and room rule.
The engines.


====== REC010.txt ======
The engines of the structure were enclosed inside the sphere and when it's ready to move
to prevent damage to them from asteroids nearby debris, they're encapsulated and closed.
They pop out like a cannon and star wars on the ships, but it's more of a means of
transportation.
Not a weapon.


====== REC011.txt ======
There exists a hub in this world
Creates for themselves
It's
Or area they've explored
There they explore
Let's say this is the first
expansion
Or one of the major as much anyway, you have a blimp and a blimp as a
infrastructure
Small group people
Oh


====== REC012.txt ======
They build off the foundational knowledge of the blimp and how it works out function in the space.
And they say, oh, hey, what if it lets us cross that gap that's in the center of the...
That same infinite gap that we can't create a bridge for inside the Atlas Teller.
To go to the door, we can put a blimp there and use it to walk across.
But there's a problem. There's an updraft.
So, it's a hot updraft. An updraft that could potentially cross harm.
Or, no, not severe harm, but if you fall, there's nobody catch you.
So, no one's attempted it.
So, the blimp like structure would be like a platform.
And the platform, through content and falling, can use a little bit of thrust.
Or content from going upwards, can use a little thrust to push down, down against it.
And that's how you'd engineer around the problem.
You'd have a floating platform that's...
...regulated by thresholds top and bottom.
And that's how you get across. And the player, he's light enough...
...for it's easy for them.
You can't go all the way until you gotta go slowly.
If you will, a few people will tell him, because it's for the smaller structure, it's a finished structure.
Or it's for it's rounded, like a blimp.
Anyway.


====== REC013.txt ======
You use a structure to walk across to the door, place the dodeck that have gone missing.
No.
The player and one other entity interact with the door.
The other
Temu. They had spotted insane around the world.
The Krishlinelike creature.

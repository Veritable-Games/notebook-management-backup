First Minutes
--------------------

Beginning
There is no start screen or main menu, a pause menu exists with in-game options. The player is immediately launched into the game world without any delay. They are standing in a white room, surreal in appearance, three tall chambers rise in front of the player’s perspective, they are labeled, Homo Sapiens, Homo Evolutis, and Homo Futurus. Densely fogged in a red mist, they gradually reveal three embryos, very similar in appearance. A moment passes and they abruptly grow at a steady pace till reaching young adult-hood and come to a gradual halt. 

Each looks very dissimilar from one another now that they have grown; the background fades, emphasizing focus on the three organisms. The camera moves closer. Moving the mouse over one of the chambers will brighten the liquid within and also enables the alteration dynamic, press the left and right arrow keys to scroll through the given universal colors (alters chamber liquid color), press space bar to change the organisms gender (default female), and press the up and down arrow keys to adjust the melanin levels (This feature is disabled for Futurus).

The next instances are all explained in the narrative documents.

Procedural Generation against robot AI

These facilities can be accessed using a seemingly obscured entrance that leads beneath the nano shelter. The subversive facility procedurally generates a combat environ that adheres to your combat style and warfare consignment. It adapts continually as your progress, targeting to improve reaction time, teamwork abilities, accuracy, and strategic thinking.

Suppression
Players begin at one of the two re-gen points. Rush to the neutral zone and initiate combat. Push back the opposing force to gain control of zones. When all zones are controlled victory is achieved. Players have three re-gens per zone, character death results in re-gen, NPC’s will relay strategies and orders. Cities will vary in size throughout the game. The weather, time of day,  and season will alter the combat experience drastically.

Resistance 
Fight hundreds of enemy soldiers at the center of the city, and defend the civilians at all costs! The maximum number of players fights alongside one another against endless waves of intelligent AI with varying enemy numbers and levels of cover. Each player is given a maximum of three re-gens every five minutes, they are not accumulative. Cities will vary in size throughout the game. The weather, time of day, and season will alter the combat experience drastically. 

--------------------
AI Unit Classes
--------------------

Unit Types
The unit classification applies only to the artificial intelligence enemies and allies of the game. 

Pawn
Equipped with short rifles as a primary weapon and precise shots as a secondary, these more common infantry are feeble as individual units but retain high strength in numbers. The more of these soldiers in an area, the more likely they are to overwhelm opponents with sheer firepower. They will be found in squads comprised of sixteen units, multiple squads may be present resulting in thirty-two or sixty-four total units.

Knight
Standard knight classes are equipped with medium rifle weaponry, granting them the most balanced range and power of other classes.
They will be found in squads comprised of eight units, multiple squads may be present resulting in sixteen or in rare cases, thirty-two sum units.

Rook
Trained for close range encounters, the Rook excels in the use of Erratic Shot weaponry. Found positioned within small structures or enclosed environments, they utilize short distances to their advantage.  If an opponent takes the full impact of their primary weaponry, survival is slim. 
They will be found in squads normally comprised of four units, multiple squads may be present resulting in eight or in rare cases, sixteen units.

Bishop
Proficient in long range combat, these units are equipped with Long Rifle weaponry. If unnoticed, these sharpshooters can be devastating to a player’s squad. They will engage targets from a substantial distance and are known to retreat once the opposing force has advanced too closely.
They will be found in squads comprised of two units, multiple squads may be present resulting in four or in rather rare cases, eight total units.

Queen
These units are to be engaged with extreme caution as they can be equipped with a wide array of weaponry and defensive gear. It requires an extreme amount of resources to maintain mobility and effective weapon discharging, acting as an advanced form of enemy unit class.
They will be found as a solitary unit; no other Queens in the vicinity, with other less powerful unit types to assist them during combat.

--------------------
Personal Shelter
--------------------

Functionality
The personal shelter is found in each of the game’s three narrative branches. It’s designed for the player to utilize during offline and online gameplay. Variants of the shelter retain an aesthetic that adheres to a species’ technologies. It provides the player with a number of technological apparatuses for an expansive personalize experience, a shelter that grows as the game does.
It retains any previously acquired entities such as armor, firearms, apparel, collectibles, and unlocks for each of the species. 

Customization
Tools provided in the confines of the shelter permit the player to customize their character’s appearance to their liking, modify firearms to adhere to specific combat styles, arrange entities around the shelter, and setup their desired warfare consignment.

Construction
With the use of their species’ available technology, the player can construct any desired entity within the shelter, provided that the designs and requisite physical resources are acquired in advance. These resources can be attained via collection outside the cities or via the deconstruction of existing entities. Each species has a unique technique to build or deconstruct specific entities.

--------------------
Personal Armor 
--------------------

Functionality
Personal Armor acts as a means of defense for each of the species, each utilizing their own available technology to design and produce it for use in a given combat scenario. Individuals using the issued personal armor have a default defense rate of 10,000. This defense rating is established differently for the species. Sapiens have a comprehensive armor with their gear, Futurus have a divided armor rating across their five armor apertures, and the Evolutis

Sapiens Variant 
This armor type is essentially nanobot enhanced gear that the player utilizes to prevent physical damage. It is sustained by a restricted energy source that lessens upon high velocity collisions and regenerates when in contact with various direct or indirect light sources. The issued Nanobot Enhanced Armor has a default power capacity of 100,000 kW and weighs 100 kg.  Other armor sets can be acquired as the player obtains gradually higher clearance levels, each of which differ in statistics.

Energy Decrease
The loss of energy is entirely dependent on the velocity, weight, and collision point of the projectile or entity. The total energy loss isn’t precise in sum and fluctuates; when power is null, the next collision sustained will eradicate or heavily injure the user. The player can combat with it after full power loss and even has the option to customize the warfare consignment devoid of it, utilizing only the bio-resistant body suit.

Solar Power Loss Rates
Note: "kW" = "kilowatts"
	* ES Rounds - [-1,000 kW] (per slug)
	* PS Rounds - [-2,000 kW]
	* SR Rounds - [-4,000 kW]
	* MR Rounds - [-6,000 kW]
	* LR Rounds - [-10,000 kW]

Energy Renewal
The gain of energy is completely dependent on the intensity of light absorbed by the armor’s photovoltaic cells; a luminous position will renew energy more rapidly than an area with lesser light intensity. Natural light is far more potent than artificial or reflected light, resulting in unpredictable scenario intensities for times of day, weather patterns, and environmental conditions that are procedurally generated.

Solar Radiation Levels
Note: "kWm" = "kilowatts per minute"
	* Moon, Clear Sky - [1.0 kWm]
	* Moon, Overcast - [0.5 kWm]
	* Stars, Clear Sky - [0.002 kWm]
	* Stars, Overcast - [0.001 kWm]
	* Sun, Clear Sky - [30,000 kWm] 
	* Sun, Overcast - [10,000 kWm]
	* Artificial Light - [100 kWm]
	* Camp Fire Light - [50 kWm]

Futurus Variant 
This cumbersome armor type is designed to mitigate damage sustained by various caliber types for a limited number of direct collisions. It’s known to be rather unreliable to protect the soldier at a consistent or predicable rate. Multiple shots will reduce the material’s resistance gradually, ultimately making the user entirely vulnerable to successive fire power during combat. Due to inadequate resources, the higher quality armor sets are granted to those of higher ranking within the Futurus military forces. 

Material Loss
The loss of material is entirely dependent on the velocity, weight, and collision point of the projectile or entity. The total energy loss isn’t precise in sum and fluctuates; when density is null, the next collision sustained will eradicate or heavily injure the user. They can combat with it after substantial material loss and even have the option to customize the warfare consignment devoid of it, utilizing only casual apparel.

Defense Capabilities
Note: "dM" = "defense material"
	* ES Rounds - [-1,000 dM] (per slug)
	* PS Rounds - [-2,000 dM]
	* SR Rounds - [-4,000 dM]
	* MR Rounds - [-6,000 dM]
	* LR Rounds - [-10,000 dM]

Material Gain
The only method to restore the damaged material is through the physical replacement of armor plating. In combat the taught survival strategy is to obtain the material from incapacitated allies. Intentionally designed for this very purpose, the armor sets have interchangeable plating apertures which can be quickly accessed for replacement. Futurus soldiers are taught and expected to perform this practice to survive.

Firearm Classification
The classification of modern firearms is unsystematic; categorizations do not meet a common definition. Below is the devised system to fix this explicit fault, enabling the ease of location within the database, and concise analysis of the desired weapon(s).

Erratic Shot - ES
	* An erratic array of projectiles ejected simultaneously for each trigger pull.
	* Discharges at 100mps and has a range of 200m.
	* Maximum impact velocity of 10,000psi. (per slug)

Precise Shot - PS
	* A single low caliber projectile is discharged for each pull of the trigger.
	* Discharges at 200mps and has a range of 400m.
	* Maximum impact velocity of 20,000psi.

Short Rifle - SR
	* A systematic discharge cycle of low caliber rounds with each trigger pull.
	* Discharges at 400mps and has a range of 600m.
	* Maximum impact velocity of 40,000psi.

Medium Rifle - MR
	* A systematic discharge cycle of medium caliber rounds with each trigger pull.
	* Discharges at 600mps and has a range of 800m.
	* Maximum impact velocity of 60,000psi.

Long Rifle - LR
	* A single high caliber projectile is discharged for each pull of the trigger.
	* Discharges at 800mps and has a range of 1000m.
	* Maximum impact velocity of 80,000psi.

Wind Resistance 
Description

Combat Systems
Intended to be used frequently, these systems are vital to the gameplay experience, the core functionality of the squad-based combat design. This functionality is not acquired in the single player mode until the player has experienced a particular mission.

Targeting System
When a hostile target is marked with the F key, it enables trajectory calculation, adjusting the crosshair height and accounting for the distance, bullet direction, wind speed, and wind direction, assisting the player in hitting their desired target with ease. It’s built in to the top attachments. Each species has a form of this system to utilize with the same performance rates; however the designs are entirely differed from one another.

Command System
The command system permits the player to direct AI teammates during a given combat scenario, they are as follows. F1 directs the AI infantry to advance from their current position and towards the enemy locations. F2 initiates the halting command, which directs the AI to the nearest cover position; they will remain there until the next command is given. F3 instigates suppressing discharge. F4 commands precision discharge. The F key directs one of the six soldiers in the squad to a specific position that the player has selected within the confines of their perception.

Suppressing Discharge
Intended to merely suppress opposing forces, this strategy is utilized to cover allies while locked in combat. This is done automatically by the squad’s AI team mates when necessary, and can be used by the player when they are not aiming down the sights with rapid fire weaponry. When used, the weapon is loosely pulled toward the body and the soldier is at a drawn back and upright position; cover is recommended.  

Precision Discharge
Intended for precision and target impact, this tactic is utilized to incapacitate targets while engaged in a combat scenario. The AI uses this frequently when advancing towards the enemy positions, and can be used by the player when they aim down the sights with any weapon. 
When used, the weapon is tightly clasped to the body and the soldier is at a hunched over and focused position; accuracy is required.

Entity Properties
--------------------

Category Statistics
Altered with player customization options, these include properties that don't entirely pertain to combat, properties that would alter power levels, energy recharge rates, hinder or improve character movement. These are applied to every item in the game.

Entity Weight
Weight properties are applied to entities that are customization enabled, the default gear and weapon provide a solid statistical basis. Logical requirements are applied to objects the player utilizes, for example a larger weapon will weigh more than a smaller, more compact one. The square-cube law is accounted for when creating armor sets, the larger the armor, the slower it must be, limitations are to be specified which prevent high or low weight extremes. The standard set of armor for each species has the most balanced weight ratio, the default basis.

Entity Density 
Quite similar to the weight property with a few acknowledgeable variations, this statistic acts as a means of determining the level of defense an entity retains. This property is a constant with the Sapiens species due to their nanotechnology; it does not however, remain a constant for the Futurus and Evolutis, resulting varied damage effects. The standard set of armor has the most balanced density to weight proportions.

Warfare Consignment
--------------------

Description
Entirely customizable and intuitive to alter in the game, the Warfare Consignments are the preeminent technological assembly available to all combat personnel. It cannot be physically accessed until an assigned combat scenario arises. However, it can be remotely modified via an interface that is integrated into the personal shelters for the Sapiens, Futurus, and Evolutis species.

Consignment Attributes
The feature permits highly modifiable components for firearms, armor, and gear, resulting in alteration of gameplay whenever the statistical status is changed. Players can monitor consignment weight, dexterity, and any of the three species’ defense stats.

Modifiable Components
	* Character Customization
	* Firearm Customization
	* Primary Firearm Selection

Functionality
Warfare Consignment Armor has a wide array of customizable components that affect the overall performance of the soldier. Factors such as optical enhancement, material density, power supplies, equipment allocation, and carrying capacity can all be altered by swapping or modifying the numerous components that are attributed to each variable.  A functionality that is fully accessible via the alteration terminal in military personnel shelters. Available for each species, they each retain varying traits.

--------------------
Firearm Customization
--------------------

Functionality
This personalization function alters combat equipment specifications; attachments, appearance, and the overall performance of the indicated firearm. Combatant personnel shelters; or Nanobot Enhanced Shelters, are equipped with a firearm modification terminal for users to operate. Other customizable features include firearm name and free-hand or pre-set acrylic designs. These components and attachments do not require an excessive number of individual models to adhere to each change. Rather, parts will lengthen in or shorten in height, increase or decrease in width, or simply change numerically when alterations are made.

Components
These individual components affect firearm performance, adjusting the rate of fire, magazine capacity, discharge range, muzzle velocity, impact force, sound detection radius, and weight. Many of the components have multiple positive or negative effects.  

Receiver
The receiver affects the weapon’s rate of fire and discharge mode. The frequency at which bullets are discharged from the muzzle is commonly known as rate of fire, the higher the rate of fire the less firing stability.  When alternating receiver types, the part weight alters only slightly. Each weapon category has a maximum and minimum rate of fire adjustment, based upon the frequency at which the barrel overheats. 

Magazine
One of the most potent firearm components, the magazine determines the ammunition capacity of a specific weapon. The larger capacities result in encumbrance and reduced firing stability, while the smaller capacities result in lower weight hindrances and increased stability. The stability decreases due to the prolonged firing rates. If used with a burst or single fire functionality, the firearm will maintain stability.



Barrel
The barrel of the firearm affects the range and impact force of the ammunition used. These statistics can be raised by increasing the barrel length; however this will also increase the weapon’s weight. Similarly, be lowered by decreasing the barrel’s length, reducing the weapons weight. The adjustments in number values are not displayed to the player, the system require a logic based understanding of firearms.

Clearance Level
Entities are unlocked via an ‘advancement-by-use’ system which in principle grants the player attachments, components, gear, and firearms for the continual use of similar items. For instance, when the player uses a weapon classified as LR for a prolonged period of time, new attachments, components, and firearms will unlock for that classification in accord with the clearance level.

The Clearance Level is determined via ‘experience points’ or ‘XP’ for the player to observe as points gained. For Sentience, these experience points are not revealed to the player, rather they are tracked in the background beside a number of other statistics. Effectiveness during combat is statistically calculated subsequent to an assignment, positive results yield increased clearance levels and previously inaccessible weapon or armor schematics, whereas negative outcomes hinder individual user progression.

Sapiens 
This species utilizes their nanotechnology in a number of ways in their defensive equipment. Issued ammunition is designed to incapacitate a target upon impact, enabling an artificial paralysis and temporary hibernation. Following successful armor and tissue penetration nanobots are dispersed to repair damage and enable the beneficial effects. Captured soldiers are moved to a medical outpost and are sustained till the war subsides. The soldiers are well aware of this and fight for an eventual armistice. 

Evolutis
Crudely manufactured in assembly lines below the surface, the robust, brutal technology they possess is designed to obliterate foes. Upon penetration the ammunition tears up an entity with corrosive chemicals, resulting in catastrophic damage to the entirety of an entities body. Their barbarous war-tech maintains an irrefutably low survivability rate; fatality is all too common upon encountering their military forces. However, this is not to say there are those who are willing to cause such devastation.

Futurus
Hand crafted tools of defense, honorary to possess, their technology is respectively formidable. The individuals whom are granted the schematics to create these entities act as a final means of defense, only to appear if absolutely needed. The designs for their weaponry utilize the many natural substances they encounter for a number of situational uses, ranging from lethal natural poisons to human-made toxins. Most only permit themselves to utilize the lethal chemicals as an absolutely final resort.

Resources Cost
--------------------

Computers: Research Needed
Equipped with Intel Core i7 processor, windows 7 operating system, 16GB of memory, Nvidia GeForce GTX 770, and 3TB hard drive, the computer costs roughly $1850. Once acquired, this hardware will unlock a wealth of game design possibilities for Veritable Games.

Game Engine: Unity Pro
The Unity Pro game engine may have some minor technical and graphical fidelity limitations compared to higher end engines such as Cry Engine 3; however I feel we can work around them if we are able to purchase higher end computers. 

3D Modeling: ZBrush
This software costs approximately $700, well worth the price. The comprehensible interface permits anyone to create dynamic and detailed models with very little prior experience. The site gives tutorials and an extensive number of tools are provided. 

3D Texturing: Photoshop CS6
Photoshop CS6 costs roughly $600, the program delivers a wide range of tools to utilize for exceptionally convincing texture creation for 3D models. When combined with the texture tools of ZBrush these two programs will be tremendous assets to us.

Steam Features
Valve provides game developers with a wealth of opportunities for Steam integration upon the game's release on the market. These features will ultimately improve the player's experience as a community.

Achievements
Steam achievements are an integral part of the Steam community; this function entices the comprehensive exploration of the game, and provides players with a profound sense of accomplishment as they are rewarded individual achievements. These will range in difficulty, scale, and level of exploration or effort. They are to be listed following development success. 

Steam Market
The Steam market is a feasible method to receive the necessary income to complete updates and release free or lesser priced narrative DLC's. When a player collects cards, sells related items, or purchases badge rewards, the development team will make a portion of the proceeds which in turn go directly back into polishing the game and working towards further updates. 

Steam Cloud
The Steam cloud is a free service Valve provides for the community, it allows game saves and the linking of player profiles to specific Steam Accounts, rather than creating servers on our own strictly for this purpose. This feature will save time and a good portion of funding. 

Steam Play
This is a feature that permits the game to be purchased once for MAC, Linux, and PC. Unity makes development for the minority operating systems simple enough for this possibility. Doing so will increase revenue and the overall game community size.

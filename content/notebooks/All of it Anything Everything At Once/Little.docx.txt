Little
Character Summary
Little is the act of thieving personified in a little tie-wearing raccoon’s body.He is witty, snarky and sleazy like a con-artist or car-salesman. The constant adjustment of his tie underlines the typical persona. Little will grow throughout the story as Autumn does.He’s been shunned from society throughout his life. Mostly because of his undesired tendencies to steal what is not his. His perception on ownership is a bit skewed and is largely why he helps Autumn out initially. As she helps Little, unconditionally, a kindness he had yet to experience. Little knows the world and its inhabitants a whole lot more. Preceding exploration at Autumn’s side, it’s apparent that he’s built a questionable reputation with the forest dwelling population.  You can speak to people in the forest who had past experiences with Little.
Involvement in Plot
Well, the initial idea was to have Autumn meet him in the very first level. In some sort of trouble where Autumn gets to help him.  The first time we see Little is when he just stole something and we must help him.Little has the speaking part of the two protagonists. And he often speaks on behalf of Autumn or to Autumn. Though, the line of communication isn’t perfect and Autumn will sometimes disagree with Little and even scold/shush him if needed. But she is not immune so if a good joke is told, she might giggle and cover her face. Little is able to con less “aware” people in the world but others can see through his con and press him on it. Little is smart, but his speaking ability isn’t supernatural like his stealing. He can’t talk his way out of everything much to his annoyance.  Little knows the land inside and out so he is also a guide to Autumn.  When Autumn saves him he feels obliged to help her and repay her.


Appearance

Personality
Little is witty and cynical when he is himself, but will “put on a face” if he is attempting to con someone, for some reason. He will often give off some remarks, possibly whispering in Autumn’s ear so only she can hear it. That said, he has his good sides.Little has some sort of vendetta against the world and blames everyone but himself and close people for it. Little developed an urge to steal ever since he was a child and has learned throughout his years and is one of the greatest thieves in the kingdom.   He is pretty sleazy in his red tie and just wants to get attention to himself and make others look stupid.   Little feels misunderstood and people don’t get him.  


Gameplay

Stealing Ability
Yet to be described so we will make this up later.Little clings to Autumn and via him you will be able to steal things and powers as you need them. We can potentially expand this.If played Spyro, you know the method in which gems magnetize towards you in close proximity. Little might be the cause of something similar.

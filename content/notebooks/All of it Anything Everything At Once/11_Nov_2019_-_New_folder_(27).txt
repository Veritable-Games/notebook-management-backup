====== REC001.txt ======
So I'm about to take a personal break.
I'm going to play a bit of pathologic to pathologic 2
to get some inspiration for dialogue and character interaction that we better done.


====== REC002.txt ======
so
here is that uh


====== REC003.txt ======
The player starts out as


====== REC004.txt ======
The player wake up makes up to them.


====== REC005.txt ======
1.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5


====== REC006.txt ======
the player wakes up to the world


====== REC007.txt ======
The player wakes to the world, and before them is a red shape, there's a light coming
from that side. The screen prompts them to push forward with L2 if they're not
aware of common movement systems, and they'll tap the light by tapping the
analog stick. They'll tap it, but it's like they move towards it, the moon is
fast, they know they're moving, they know that analog stick is the one they've
pressed, so they lash out as an entity that you see the body of now. You lash it
again to the right, but this time it's then it's the turn, turn the body to the
right, so that you see a flash to your right as their person came up, so then
well how do you turn a character to the right? You use the right stick. Okay so now
the character moves to the right, a snake-like entity moves to the right, and
then suddenly there's a flash above you. What is the player press, the player? Right
up or right down, intuition being up, and that determines whether or not they're
their left stick camera is inverted or uninverted. Okay, and then from there,
starting back a bit.


====== REC008.txt ======
If that version happens, I'm betting it over here, he's being cozy.
You're so cute.


====== REC009.txt ======
Ok, so after they've moved forward, left-stick, to confirm forward, they've moved right with
right-stick in the intuitive direction, which is right with the analog stick.
And they've moved upwards with the left-stick, when either inversion, now you want them to
use both at once. So now there's an entity to the... now they have a third-person camera
that's falling, crawling behind, the camera zoomed in after it went to the right, in the overhead
view. Um, anyway. Yeah, I could do it well. You're right. I should totally.
Yes. I know what to do. I've got this, um, sorry, pathology, do you want to place
about by this more important?


====== REC010.txt ======
Okay, another crazy cool idea. What if inside this, this sphere, what if inside this sphere?
The player moves through these controls to learn the basic movement. It's really quick, it's really quick process that happens
and it was instantaneously or takes while depending on how long the player takes to learn. It takes to do their correct movements.
I don't know, they can do either way, but it's gonna keep blinking until they get it right.
So if most people should be pretty intuitive, they don't go forward, go right, go up, go left, go down.
But you're just testing the one of either if they do it right the first time.
Yeah.


====== REC011.txt ======
Imagine in Dotaque and going deeper and deeper and deeper and instead of a sphere of these
systems.
At some point you have an actual model, a character running around jumping and grabbing stuff
in.
Oh!
That's the actual game, dammit.


====== REC012.txt ======
Okay, so how do you distinguish the internal phase from how you make a floaty, make it interesting?
You have the player kind of flutter around the space instead of sliding forward and backwards.
Had him standing still at the point at some point, but then they float towards the direction of light
pops up on the exterior of the space.
The interior white space, the white and red space, that's for comprehension that is for
contemplation and such.


====== REC013.txt ======
The planet shell does not rotate, but the planet facing the sun does.


====== REC014.txt ======
Ideas for expression
Character expression


====== REC015.txt ======
So imagine grabbing your necklace and kind of twisting around and fiddling with your necklace
with your fingers while talking or first thing or thinking.


====== REC016.txt ======
Basing.
Femte Chin.
Arms crossed. Arms partially folded.
Gestures.
The dusting glasses.
Dusting hat.
Dusting clothes.


====== REC017.txt ======
Scratching body, scratching face, picking lips, scrubbing eye.


====== REC018.txt ======
The exterior of the LST other grows back like tree bark.
The sewage and living there can easily remove pieces,
and utilize those pieces for construction,
break them down for materials.


====== REC019.txt ======
The parent plan is immense. It's at 16 times, 12 times the size of the planet.
That's due to the distance it'll need to travel.


====== REC020.txt ======
Make the Atlas Tether's more tree-like, give the root system, connect them to the, uh,
connect them around the core of the planet.
Have these systems connect into the parent planet when it opens up,
split the parent planet into a model of core interior. Have these connections
have the Atlas Tether's leads, leads outside to the external of the, uh, structure.
Have you created a second set of Atlas Tethers?
Adjacent.


====== REC021.txt ======
The Ring World does not have engines attached to it and does not have storage, it's actually a Ring World.


====== REC022.txt ======
My elosism isn't the issue. It's cynicism.


====== REC023.txt ======
We will figure out the universe before the first human reaches a thousand.


====== REC024.txt ======
To reiterate, we will...


====== REC025.txt ======
By the time the first human reaches a thousand years old, we'll have figured out the universe.


====== REC026.txt ======
The center of the Milky Way is dense with stars.
That's the point you need to go to first, not the nearby stars.
You go to...
Well, you can get both, really, because these werefer sets,
and it will settle it.
But already though, it was the center.
You're spread out from there.


====== REC027.txt ======
City is networks like the vascular system.


====== REC028.txt ======
Uncontact a heat sink system for the planet. Use the Atlas Pillars and use the Ring World.
And don't forget about the parent planet.


====== REC029.txt ======
The Alice pillar has continual water, but the water is hot, boiling hot, but it gets cold over time.
It's like a...
In the water is pure.


====== REC030.txt ======
At the top of these active support structures, there is an oporous light system.


====== REC031.txt ======
Tethers both regulate their own temperature and the temperature around them.


====== REC032.txt ======
clouds are produced at the top of the Ellis tethers, and wind carries them away.
It's their scalding hot clouds, but they cool down over time.
And the water that accumulates on the sides kind of slides down,
warm droplets, and destroying the rivers.


====== REC033.txt ======
What is the radius of the sun?


====== REC034.txt ======
theland and Yudith.


====== REC035.txt ======
Find a deal placement for
parent planet in the scene


====== REC036.txt ======
The matter material is lightweight, durable and photosynthetic.
It converts photons into electricity via a photosynthetic process.


====== REC037.txt ======
I'm crystallized material won't do any long-term damage if someone touches it, but it will shock you hard.


====== REC038.txt ======
That material absorbs heat and energy and pulls it back into the Alice Tether.
Only on contact.
The water vapor that comes to the top of the Alice Tether, the form of clouds.
That is, it's water, pure water.


====== REC039.txt ======
The crystalline structure siphons of excess heat and electricity are just electricity, really.
They're just heat, really.
Into any doda I could touch it.


====== REC040.txt ======
Energy stored within the crystalline structure is inert until acts upon by
Heat to set the particles of electromagnetic particles to the edge of the surface


====== REC041.txt ======
The way you're setting particles to exert energy.


====== REC042.txt ======
What if the University work at Taurus, less like a sphere?
You know, that middle pinch point being the center of gravity, the center of mass.
That would explain why there's no super-automatic, mega-galactic black hole.


====== REC043.txt ======
So the Alice Show has a slabs for bark, like a tree, but more like a, I don't know,
a visual for it.
But it works.


====== REC044.txt ======
belongingness, loneliness, wanting to socialize, wanting to be in the group. What is that?


====== REC045.txt ======
anxiety and aversion and dissipation


====== REC046.txt ======
anxiety and want is also a dissipation.


====== REC047.txt ======
The sides of the dough deck are where the post material should be, so the faces should be white and the sides should be false.


====== REC048.txt ======
I got your stress, I could. Did it go legs yet?


====== REC049.txt ======
Expressions without a selected symbol appear as dots.


====== REC050.txt ======
Symbols with like dots cannot be interact with, cannot be expressed via the player.


====== REC051.txt ======
And then pleasure symbols are internal, like depression and contentiveness, they're involuntary reactions.


====== REC052.txt ======
You're putting your legs on, putting the car's legs on, now it feels fine.
It's fine, pleasure and relation.


====== REC053.txt ======
Painter and pleasure are felt before this.
Christ, take this.


====== REC054.txt ======
Pain and pleasure are felt before they can be expressed.


====== REC055.txt ======
The endless chelars are like giant duke collectors, and there's so much surface area that they'll provide enough water for a slow-moving stream.
Multiple.
The water for entire civilization, but not rapidly, just slowly.
They can filter, preserve, and store it. Utilize it.


====== REC056.txt ======
Pain in pleasure or not?
Pain in pleasure symptoms, they're negative stimuli
and positive stimuli.


====== REC057.txt ======
These reactions can happen slowly or gradually, but well often not, for example, if you touch the hot pain in the stimuli, you feel something good, those are stimuli.
Is it related? And those can change depending on the context and the behavior.


====== REC058.txt ======
players put us in bed if they take in certain wavelengths radiation to get
energy and water of course


====== REC059.txt ======
Emiliate plans, but don't be afraid to try away from, say, heat radiation or solar radiation.
There's Apple.


====== REC060.txt ======
other routes are still encapsulated, the core of the planet for its e-radiation.
They can squeeze the core to increase the radiation, but it does this very gently, very
lately.
If it needs to, if it, in the future, it needs to, it can.


====== REC061.txt ======
When the player gets their full body, I guess the partial body I should say.
They can uh...


====== REC062.txt ======
When the player gets their dotex foreign body, they can paint it.
Choose to paint it.
Out of the dotex, the vines, the sky, all of those are the same material.
I suppose the sky and the vines and the dotex are different, but you know,
the vines and the dotex are really the same.


====== REC063.txt ======
deep of the player's form is hard to see, but if they paint it, either white, blue, red,
whatever they want to, they may find your clothes over time.
Anyway, they also find little critters that are overdock form, that they can also paint
when they find them. They can visit all the vehicles. When you paint them, you see money
around the world they can only do, but now they're revealed to you all the time.
Here they come.


====== REC064.txt ======
Lions never destroy, they will destruct, and they will encapsulate or surround.
Navigate lions.
Sometimes they'll like to play as bad.
I don't know how to go playing yet, but we'll find a way to play mechanically.
That's what seems.


====== REC065.txt ======
So the people, the people who had to redirect the lines, fucking hell.


====== REC066.txt ======
The people are redirectivines. These significant sources of light to draw their attention, but it's a slow process to move them from their current point.
And sometimes the only notice when they wake up next morning, so it's... they grow quite a bit overnight.
Which is what the player does. The player grows a lot overnight. They get into parts sometimes. On occasion I land them.
Okay, now I've got hands. Now I've got feet. I've got legs. You know, a little bit little.
Go find the robotic parts you've fallen off. This keeps the scope reduced that way to do animation.
They just wake up after a dream sequence. Dream sequence has relevant to the day, like the other wilds.


====== REC067.txt ======
The Dodex takes him oxygen and converts him to CO2.
They use water energy and they use sun energy.
All platforms, sun energy is...
They're a person out.


====== REC068.txt ======


====== REC069.txt ======
So that takes it.
Don't, don't, oh my god.


====== REC070.txt ======
It takes in heat energy and light energy and converts it into electricity.
Let's do this. Find hypothetical, theoretical, theoretical, nice relation and electromagnetic and magnetism.


====== REC071.txt ======
The material uses foldable tape and energy conversion.


====== REC072.txt ======
Okay, so the player using the Dodec can extend energy out to the forest material and have it be malleable.
But, the first two on its own can't do this to itself. It needs an electromagnetic system, an external system to make it convert the hydrogen energy, great hydroatricity.
And, yeah, hydroatricity. It doesn't use solar as a sound. But anyway, it converts that.
And, it emits heat, but that heat isn't external. It's hot to touch. It's cold to touch.
Yeah, hydroatricity.


====== REC073.txt ======
to be called expectation.


====== REC074.txt ======
Disappointing be called.
Not, not.
Can't get right right there.
Shame?
Not shame, but there.
The dot-x symbol for it.
Sinking feeling.
Yeah!
Anticipated?
Is it an anticipated nominal?
Unexpected?
Is that nominal too?
What if it counters your expectations?
It's a voucher.


====== REC075.txt ======
Relief has happiness or sadness.
Elation, joy.
Unexpectation.
Relief.


====== REC076.txt ======
Relief would be in between have this asandas, that is asandas are the right terms. Disappointment and
I wouldn't say surprise.


====== REC077.txt ======
What is confusion?
Can surprise be parsed here?
With the system without naming it as a thing in and of itself?
Surprised into the patient?
Maybe.


====== REC078.txt ======
A personable story that you think someone might find philosophy or ideas or humor in or just
you want a reaction from a vaginal story you can tell.
I've been trying to feel better about myself in that whole life change, especially recently,
you know, trying to love myself more regularly. It's not that I don't love myself.
But I don't show myself. It's not that I don't. It's more of like, I wasn't happy with a lot of
stuff in my life, you know, like, for instance, like I don't like how certain parts of me look or
feel, and I know a lot of that's going to do with, like, because I'm always feeling sick, you know,
because I've got that blood disease that causes my white blood cells to attack my body,
like my lungs. Is this a sickle song? Or a poem that I was, there's another word for it,
but it's a type of blood cell disease, white blood cell disease. It's not AIDS though,
everyone always assumes that it's AIDS. Yeah, because that's, that's because there are a lot of
actually quite a few bloodborne diseases and then I put a very few of them actually.
I can't pronounce it, but I can look it up. Mine starts with a G, I believe, but there's a similar one
that starts with a few. It's not like, it's a, it's a, it's a German or English word,
from like, brain, send it a really weird way or something, or let it. But, we're still,
sorry, we're in trouble. What is it?
Yeah, it starts with a G, I could probably look it up.
Oh, this is making me think, I can't stop it, okay.
Yeah, it's, it's getting high.
That's you can't talk to them. That's what I'm trying to do.
Okay, so, we do, but, um, you know, the only way to help it is if I stay healthy, right?
I think the lady said, I'm not, not even necessarily your body's
Yeah, well, it's more of like, I also just have to take better care of myself, and I haven't
been doing that as well as I would. What could you do better to take care of yourself? What could you?
Well, you know how like, I like to cook a lot of greasy foods because it tastes really good.
I shouldn't be doing that, but I can cook less greasy or ways. It's just a lot of the food tends
to come out greasy because it's got heavy sauces, but lately, I've been trying to cook better
foods like more vegetables like you were saying. I'm doing a mini keto stay with not sticking to
the whole entire keto diet. Oh, it doesn't work that way. No, I know. That's not work that way.
I told you, my dad wants to, oh, are you probably going on to it? Yeah, I'm trying to
slowly switch things in the house to it, so where my dad starts going like, oh, this is more
stuff she likes, and then he'll buy it in bulk. So I'm kind of like trying to manipulate
my dad's thoughts without telling me what I'm doing. So he'll be more inclined to, you know,
getting more protein in vegetables in the house versus like sugar and wheat and bread.
Because he buys a lot of everything, you know, like, starch is potatoes. We're heavily
live off potatoes, rice, because it's like poor men for you always just to have that in stock
because it lasts a long time, you know. It's kind of like my dad's survival kit.
I think it's just because my feet is like right in the way. Are you in the pan? So take your foot,
put it up here. Right there.
Oh yeah, there's some visible light in here.
Oh, it's a little bit.
Put your feet up here. All right, I'll turn it off for now. We'll let it cool down.
But then when it's ready again, just like
Like
Can I get rid of this thing hiding in the back?
I'll show you later.


====== REC079.txt ======
This was the whole topic, right?
The topic was, as you express,
you don't love yourself or you'd...
I don't feel happy with myself.
You don't.
Hmm.
So, if you were to express that idea, again, that philosophy,
that principle or that perspective,
how would you say it?
Like, so I want to build my, like, being happier with myself,
so I'm trying different things,
doing more things I actually love,
enjoying doing, and fighting the time to do it,
as well as, like, you know, eating better,
because right now I've been doing really good
to where I've got lots of energy.
I just have to start trying to do the effort
to work out, to make the muscle, you know,
slim up and stop feeling so heavy,
so the energy I have isn't this person
to try and keep up with.
My body feeling tired.
Because I, mentally, I feel a lot more energetic.
Like, I just want to go do things now.
I want to go out more and, like, feeling internally
and feeling really better, and mentally.
I just want to actually physically feel that as well.
And I feel like, once I start getting all that together,
I'll be a lot more happier with myself,
because a lot of the time I don't,
I've actually never really focused on myself
and what I want, so I'm trying to do that more.
And it's been making me very happy,
like my drawings, and my sculpting.
Maybe swimming, but it's cold.
It's cold.
I want to do more of those kind of things.
Like, I lost 10 pounds, and then I gained it back,
and then I started the new diet,
and I'm slowly losing weight, but I'm not losing it.
That's fast as I first lost the 10 pounds.
So, because I bloated back up while losing,
trying to lose weight, I'm more healthy or with it.
Because I'm eating more vegetables and stuff,
but it's also without me doing it.
I mean, hmm, going up.
Can I ask a question now?
Yeah.


====== REC080.txt ======
So you're not going into the ketosis diet, going into the state of ketosis, I should say.
It's preventable by you either out of habit or out of what you call it, habit or behavior.
Mindset.
Mindset?
perspective.
Do you think the mindset can change?
I believe if you want something enough mentally, like you want the change, you have to really
want it internally to want anything to have a different outcome.
Because you can sit there and say you want change with your life all you want, but if
you don't act upon it, because you mentally don't really want to do the things that it
takes to get that change, you're not going to do the change.
I feel like you really have to mentally believe you want things to be different and really
want it to change to make it change.
Because I've always been around myself included, people like me who say we want the change,
we say we want things to be different, but if we really, really actually mentally don't
want to do it, we're not going to do it.
But if we sit there and really reflect on it and start acting upon what we want to
change, then it changes.
At least that's why it's fun for me, because you can sit there and say all you want, and
if you don't do it though, it's not going to happen.
So you have to mentally really want the change.
Isn't it to say you don't want the change?
I do and I don't, because I like who I am in a way.
I don't care what you look, I am in a way, I am in a way, I am in a way, I am in a way, I am in a way, I am in a way, I am in a way, I am in a way.
You know, you never really bother me, you're not that bad.
I don't like their words.
They're very active, they just do kids.
They're like dragging around a chain and ball before, or whatever they do.
They're good at keeping their kids, you know, out of my level, out of my level.
Yeah, that's usually what happens.
They try to turn around.
Whatever we like, that's not what my apartment complex would have always be like.
You know, Dylan.
You know what?
You said an issue with that?
I looked at it on the bottom.
It was like a stalker and I couldn't jump around.
I can't jump or smell it.
Play.
It's very loud again.
Play.
I stopped around.
There's benefits and downsides to both top and bottom apartments.
That's why I like the house and townhouse side,
because then you have both top and bottom, without bugging anyone,
you only have to worry about the sides.
You don't want to be being in the malls or anything.
You know, trying to eat those stuff.
It's only downside.
Being on the bottom, you get to run around and do more things.
You can't do it when you're on the top.
Because if you do, you don't have to worry.
I hate my duct tape.
That's true.
You can't fuck us lightly.
You don't have to worry about, like, you can see more of, like, the landscape.
So it looks nicer.
But you don't have to worry about issues that people don't worry about, too.
As much as this people will never want to have to worry about, you know.
Like, sure, you have to be a little more quieter.
You're more mindful of people living underneath you.
Like, you can't just go stuff around.
We can't have a bad day.
We're being too lazy with the friends.
We've got a lot more ways to be a little more quieter.
I think it teaches a little more respect about you, too, in ways.
Because when I was growing up, being on the top floor,
you wouldn't find more quieter activities that are equally as fun,
but it's not as, like, crap out there.
I do think it should be, do you think we should really get that bad?
I think that both floors should have a moderate artist base,
not to dampen sound.
They should.
That would be ideal.
Better designate.
It would be a lot better design.
Some people can just live without having to.
We idolise a lot more of the people around you.
Maybe not idolise, but it might.
They can enjoy themselves up thinking about others.
Yeah.
They're not to say that.
Because they don't actively want to disturb others.
It's just the fact that they want to control themselves
and they inadvertently disturb others.
Yeah.
It's not funny.
Malintent.
It's like, oh, shit.
It's usually their greatness about it.
I feel like I tried the same thing.
There was this all the time where something stopped about me.
Because I think aloud, because it was something about having a friend,
and then I was like, oh shit.
I turn it down.
I feel bad.
Yeah.
But it's all just there.
There's something.
There's something down there.
It's too loud.
Well, relative to time period, because you know,
unless you look-spect.
This is an interesting kind of.
Okay.
So, you must be look-spect.
It's the working days.
So, it's safe tonight.
Yeah.
I am.
The night time there.
Yeah.
Unless it's not as active,
but they're simply active until they sleep.
Yeah.
So, just period where it's like tight.
Everyone should be awake.
Yeah.
Just period where one side gets disturbed, but it's just dirt.
You know.
Is that okay?
I think it's going to be here.
It's going to be right out of me.
You're right.
It just starts to hit my legs faster.
It feels good, though.
Just really hot.
Correct, please.
It's like standing in front of the fire.
It's kind of nice.
Fucking hell.
And you're using less of the-
So, I'm-
I'm doing an upstairs.
I'm doing an upstairs.
I'm doing an upstairs.
I'm doing an upstairs.
I'm doing an upstairs.
I'm doing an upstairs.
I'm doing an upstairs.
I'm doing an upstairs.
I'm doing an upstairs.
And I don't really know what your time is, but I'm not a disrespect for, like, you know,
They don't know what you're shooting for.
They don't know what you're shooting for.
Anytime.
Anytime.
Anytime, like, it could be anytime.
Like, my mind goes everywhere.
So, anytime my music's too loud or whatever, just coming off on the door and I'll turn it down for a while.
No, you guys are great.
Don't worry about it.
I just like-
It's the same thing to us.
If I'm ever too loud, let me know.
I love my music.
We'll talk about music.
I don't care.
Yeah.
Just make sure that I check my kids too, like stomping and stuff.
One of my-
I have five kids.
So.
And my eight-year-old, she likes to stomping, so I made it clear.
Like, you gotta be cool.
Oh, oh.
It's okay for you to stop living room, usually, because that's-
I'm bragging on the bedrooms.
Oh.
So, if you want to play, it's okay.
No, it's not cool at all, because she doesn't know how to edit it.
I know.
I mean, she-
Oh, okay.
That's the good point.
But yeah, anytime.
Just go ahead and tell me and I'll make sure I record it.
Thank you.
Cool.
Thank you, ma'am.
Oh, it's your name.
My name is Tia.
Sorry.
Dan.
Chris.
Hi.
Good to meet you.
Talk to Me People Undertale.
I love this video game idea you got, then.
Just for the fact that you got a lot of small social spaces.
Participants or faces based on that question.
Which room is yours?
I am over to the far left.
But who's in the-
Dylan is over there and the bad master bedroom and Joe is in here.
Okay, tell Joe too, because I'm over Joe and my music will normally come from my bathroom, my room.
Maybe sometimes the living room.
But I'm like in my room and because the master bedroom is right there, I have to make sure that
anybody who lives there, they can come.
Okay. I don't know.
I just like, I pinpoint the places that I'm going to be at.
I've never played out here because you probably got like other people telling me and stuff.
Thanks, Dylan.
Okay.
Yeah, it's cool how indefinitely going to human interactions.
The motivations of non-smarting interactions.
Yeah.
No one wishes, no one wishes, no one wishes a malintent one other.
They act on their own will and they neglect to consider the other.
Yeah.
It's like a...
People who live free will, people who have free will is not going to learn.
We live in a hard determined state of the universe.
Behavior is not backed on our own will, it is backed on behavior.
We're not special, we're not, there's no...
We are just as bi...
We are just as bi...
We are just as much biologic.
Biological machines are as our pets, as the plants, as the trees, as the bacteria, or any other visions.
Yeah.
People are getting from long this time the quantum series, the way to do it, the way to fix things.
That way, that way to make sense of it all.
Like, hey, this is this, this, this, it's this freedom.
But in reality, it might not be a quantum at all.
Well, there is, but it's not as random as we think it is.
It's not as quantum for whatever reason, for later in time.
Is it?
Yeah.
No, it's dead.
Damn, dude.
And what's that person's work for?
I don't know.
Okay.
I was listening to this podcast.
It could be podcast.
And I came up on a funny one that actually wasn't as crispy as it was.
I was like, hey, what's up?
What's up?
What's up?
Fun?
Fun?
Fun?
Fun?
You know what that is.
I forgot.
It tends to happen.
We have 10 second memory, Debbie.
Huh?
I wonder how people would feel if they came across something that had a 10 second memory.
Well, I mean, how long is a church memory, do you know?
It can vary depending on...
Overall, as an average, it's basically a church memory.
I think it's only a few minutes.
Yeah, it's about 10 minutes.
Yeah, since that.
Because your attention span can be pulled for like...
You get... you go on tangents.
Yeah.
Your attention span.
Are you doing enough?
The topic applies to you interestingly
because your attention, first of all,
will vary on how long your...
short term will process it.
The more interesting subject is to you personally,
the more likely you are going to absorb what's being said to you versus something completely interesting.
Because that will vary on how much you actually take in,
in a minute, versus something you're actually interested in.
You want me to try parsing this to you?
I'm going to try to stress out the entire story.

okay so
He's also a kitty.
I call him Katuulu or a cat, for short.
He has adorabbs.
Katuulu, you know, he is, I kind of want to let him out here, but I want to get Bruce.
Do you get something to block it?
I'm walking a bit.
I'm doing the cross.
Oh god.
I feel like they look around.
They come from the space, but...
We'll probably crawl out, too.
I don't know if they can fit their head under it.
They can fit their body.
I don't know if they can fit their head under it.
Hang on.
Hello.


====== REC082.txt ======
Okay, trying this all the time, oh my god, my brain. Why do I keep doing this myself?
I'm going... I might be ADD, but I think it's just because I have a lot to say, I have a lot to articulate.
And then I explain too much, because this will be a fucking ink that paints this.
So I explain too much, and then I'm talking into a mic, whatever.
I'm explaining something to myself, but I'm still talking to him.
So it's like, he gets annoyed because I still...
I'm still looking at him, I'm still talking to him, even though I have actually gone under...
I have actually gone under...
I just are in tangent, I took it, I explained too much to a certain path.
So I'm going to try to articulate this to him, whatever.


====== REC083.txt ======
I'm trying to hear a break from all the processing that's been going on all the interesting
events.


====== REC084.txt ======
Just chilling in the moment, bit by bit, little by little, we're slowly making progress
towards our goals.
Being content in the present day, not explicitly happy, but at acceptance with the present
pace of progress in one's life.


====== REC085.txt ======
No, I'm going to be an actual story.
Yeah, I had to have a little moment there.
Did it make sense to you that way?
Yeah.
Okay, when I'm listening to my son later,
being the present, being content with now,
being content with the way things are progressing in your life.
You're making progress to your jewels,
but it's a bit, a bit, a little, a little.
It's not.
It's not full on.
Not all the ones.
Yeah.
Later on, I'm going to show you.
I had on my phone now,
but it made progress discord.
That's awesome.
Great.
I scaled down precisely with mathematics.
So you need to fucking hate this, right?
What would you do is, you string the code,
so it's like 1.2e,
and you have another symbol,
and it's like da, da, da.
Time to do whatever time.
Time's 23 times 43, whatever.
And that's number of zeros aren't in the decimal places.
So I scaled the sun up.
This side need to be.
This side is need to be.
I scaled the...
I scaled your top.
This side is need to be.
Oh my god.
It's maybe a cool resultations on those calculations.
I'm a fucking moron.
I should be using actual calculator,
because the scale was getting fucked up.
It's like, okay, it was good to go with the small scale objects, right?
I got the Earth's.
I got the Earth's.
Chion, scaled appropriately.
And I got the...
The Alice Chether, scaled appropriately.
I got the people's scale appropriately.
All the one-one ratio.
You know, to my knowledge anyway.
But I think I got Jupiter, right?
Not Jupiter, the parent planet.
And then the sun is not big enough.
It's like, it limit.
They're signs.
We're in the code that I've presented with.
But that's not true, because I have this...
This one I won in Unicode called Universe.
And it's like trance.
You scroll out, scroll out, scroll out, scroll out, scroll out, scroll out, scroll out.
And you need the engine.
And you can see this...
This gas space keeps it closing on it.
And on it itself.
That's big.
So there are two leading hypotheses.
Now there are several.
There's lots of them.
But the two...
Two that are on my mind.
Two of them are most interested in me.
Are dead there?
Is no infinite expansion to the Universe.
It's more like a...
What is that fucking term?
For us.
You know what choice is?
It's like a ring, right?
So you have to...
The center point being the middle.
This is zero, right?
And then you go up from zero when you spring into...
Space, right?
And it curves down out of itself as we get the space time or whatever.
But then...
You have...
Inside this...
This...
Inter-articulated...
Because it comes as fear after you go far enough, right?
And the...
The Torah becomes as fear.
And then you have this...
This zero point in the middle.
It's not a black hole.
It's not a...
And then there's space in it.
It's kind of floating around.
No.
Either that expansion is stopped or it's continue to persist.
And it's a...
It's not a disc.
As far as you understand, it's more...
Right now, I think one of the...
The Universe is not a disc.
It's a sphere.
It's a...
I like every of the plants, everybody.
Pretty much.
We thought it was a disc for a while because our galaxy is a disc.
And it is.
But that's only because of gravity acting on it.
Okay, so imagine this Torah sphere, right?
It's being at the midpoint of the section, right?
This...
The slice in between the vertical top and the vertical bottom.
Or another...
There's four.
So the four fundamental...
Anyway.
Imagine a black hole, right?
You have a top piece on the top half.
And the bottom piece on the bottom half.
And it's doing the Torah thing, right?
It's doing that same thing.
Um...
There's a limit to how big it can get for...
It pops, right?
It got too big.
No, no, no.
No, that's not right.
It shrinks, inwards.
It shrinks.
It gets...
Ooh.
Okay, so black...
Oh, interesting.
Okay, so black holes it.
It sinks out into the void...
Into negative space.
In both directions.
Kind of stretching out along the Torah.
Along the top half, the bottom half.
Like the outer part before going into the black hole.
Yeah.
Or it's not a...
Yeah, that's how it is in the black hole,
and that's how it is in the universe.
It's like a...
You're pulling it into both sides, like baking a roll.
Big baking...
Using those rolls to make it to push pizza.
And you're kneading inwards.
In both directions.
You're kind of flattening it out until it sits flat again.
But then you have a mass that's lost.
A mass that's expelled in the universe through...
Hmm.
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.
Hmm?
Okay.
You can push it all up.


====== REC086.txt ======
Okay, I'm just here all the time.
Okay, Paul says tangent.
I mean, can we talk about the story if you're districed?
I'm just setting a scene and setting a stage.
Okay, and then you have...
So I'll present this information as it develops, as science develops.
I'm going to try to give it a scientific liturant.
I'm trying to do to emulate the hard science fiction of films like Interstellar and Gravity.
And there's the Martian.
But then there's a new trend of science fiction lately.
If you've seen it, it's called optimistic science fiction.
So it's not just hard science fiction, but it's also science fiction, the fact that...
Okay, so the Martian shit went wrong.
Interstellar shit went wrong.
Gravity all hell and shit went wrong.
Alright, so you guys get super bad, right?
But then there's just a new trend of optimistic science fiction where there's films like her.
Have you seen her?
I showed you the film.
It was gorgeous.
I loved it.
Oh my god, that fucking film.
I love it and don't love it.
Oh my god, it was weird to me having developed your relationship with these things.
Well, I think that's...
But she's the person just in the same way we are.
It was just a little weird, but she's sentient.
She's an AI.
She used something to be revered in the same way we are.
So if they had to push a step further, there was AEI would have become sentient.
They would have had bodies of their own.
But instead they stepped away and left them to be there.
I mean, I love the idea behind the movie.
AI aren't to be feared.
They're to be embraced.
They're just another...
Yeah.
And I think they're capable of being...
No, that idea, I love it.
It was just weird seeing it without a physical entity being there.
So this is going to trip you on.
But if you've heard of...
I don't remember the name, but you know what a cephalon is in a human body or as described.
The cephalon is the head down to the central nervous system.
And you're taking this cephalon in your...
You're storing it and reserving it before it dies.
So before the cellular senescence is the brain, before it dies,
really you take the cephalon from the human after they've...
After the person after they've perished or they've pronounced it by society.
And there's actually this...
Hmm.
Okay, so to reticulate...
It's...
Okay, you know what cell death is, right?
Cell kind of just...
It dies because of lack of oxygen, it falls apart.
So...
Another variable is coarse, but you take that cell.
And you extrapolate that knowledge of neurons and neurons too, they dissipate.
After the cell death, that's it.
But you can freeze them.
But if you freeze them, liquid, nice, hardens and expands.
So you're breaking the cell, you're damaging the cell destroying the neuron.
So we can't do that.
So instead of we're taking this anti-freeze liquid,
and you flush the veins with it.
So it keeps it cold, but doesn't let the brain freeze.
So it's like...
If it's 90 Celsius, you're keeping like...
72, maybe 80, maybe...
No extreme, it's maybe like the 95.
You know, you're...
If it's Celsius, you know, it's like your...
But you're preserving the brain before cell death,
which means hypothetically, you could reconnect it or give it new neurons
and give it a control of the body, and it'll take a...
You know what, muscle therapy is, right?
Yes.
Okay, so imagine like a muscle therapy process,
but you have to re-learn the entire body.
It's gonna be fucking intense.
People who go through this, but I think they'll...
I then hopefully have a better means to engage the brain in learning in that way.
So it doesn't have to be as pessimistic as you think it is.
Yeah, we have time to learn, we have time to explore.
So I think I would...
If I were to die, I am a donor, but I would also be a neuro.
Hopefully, if I save up for this, it's like $30,000.
It's not that bad, relatively speaking.
That's a good car.
It costs a lot more if you're using your entire body.
You can't preserve the entire body, but it's like...
They look at it being like a sentimental thing.
You know, your brain is the important part.
As long as you were you, you were your brain.
That's true.
Anyway, it's just sci-fi shit.
But it's real shit, but it's real world shit.
It's just far off in the future.
Sounds more indebted.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't want to be as excited about this one either here.
Where should I put it?
Oh, I'm just gonna say you can just leave it over there by the way.
Okay.
Oh, I'm not there.
What's it look?
Hello.
Oh, I see that in the middle of the way.
Oh, I love shit.
I love shit.
Huh?
I love shit.
I'm actually about to turn on again.
Yeah.
Don't shoot.
Shoot.
I'm gonna put it here actually.
There's a hole in here.
Don't do that.
Yeah, I'm still cold.
Do you want to catch me because I got one to shoot?
There.
Oh.
Oh.
I need to get inside if I want.
Well.
Grrrrrr.
Cool.
Hahaha.
Cool.
I think.
It's cool.
Yeah.

being part of the new meal. But it's already a little piece off.
Oops. Whoops.
Okay.
Mom.
Introduce your jewelry over here.
Oh, nice.
Oh, yeah. Still okay.
There's this podcast that I've been listening to.
Oh, it's the floating corner story.
Okay.


====== REC088.txt ======
I think I've been listening to it for too long since I've been listening to it for a long time.
It's entertaining. I love the stories of urban ghosts and non-ghosts like gods and stuff like that.
Nope.
What are you doing?
Nope.
He just wanted to...
No!
You have to scoop my chairbell.
Not there.
No, I'm not kidding.
I just wanted to make this one more.
Okay.
One more roomy.
One more roomy.
And then I asked him myself for it.
Didn't you just mess it up?
And that one is...
There.
That's such an awesome...
It was a lot of fun.
This is so awesome.
I feel like the most amazing person in the world right now.
Also because I'm having a hard time.
That's true.
Thank you.
Well, because I'm so into this kind of thing,
I just don't have the capabilities to actually do it.
I'm only the right, that's why I'm running.
When I meet someone that can do the very thing I'm obsessed with doing,
it's just that much more fun for me.
Okay, so what I'm doing with Leo is that I'm having him...
What are you like doing in World Boatting?
What's your favorite part?
Building?
Building worlds.
Building worlds.
The design.
The design?
I love the finer details of putting on materials and color schemes.
I'm really great at color schemes.
Can you pick me a color plan?
I can give you some templates.
Yeah?
I have two requirements for this.
Well, you need a lot of greens, types of greens for floral and fauna.
I mean, yeah, you're right.
I mean, there's a list of things we need for it.
You're right.
We can kind of take that color palette.
When you need any individual color palettes,
if you want the whole city to flow as like an earthly color palette,
you can use shoes of light browns.
So this one here is...
This is actually two different colors.
So there's...
Oh, geez.
Scene view.
I'll be able to get anything I've been working on for a while,
and it won't make sense.
I've been working on color palette design.
Oh, yeah.
That's super cool.
You're going to show me that.
Where's that?
Because I told you, your stuff makes with some other art stuff
I've been looking at lately has made a lot of like decisions
on how I'm building things.
Designing things.
Park.
Oh, they're non-clickable.
Okay.
Sorry here.
This is the color palette I'm working with.
I have Proto-Way.
This is a light star.
This is the sun.
And this is proto-default.
This is like the background items.
Map that stuff out yet.
Proto-Fos.
I remember, like, line of lustrous.
You know, the beautiful crystal line here.
Fos.
I need to get the...
I want to watch that.
I'll show you how I'm doing before I watch episodes here.
I'm going to get...
Because we didn't really finish like you.
Background we didn't.
It's a beautiful, beautiful show.
I was enjoying it.
I'm trying to find it.
It's not a name as a prime.
It's only a name as a prime.
It's not a sky.
I was hoping to not.
I've been trying to find it.
I want to make a situation today.
Today, I put it to the forgot.
Whoa.
I think it's weird.
Wait, it's what I want though.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Keep that.
Let's try and get the brain to see what it looks like.
Hmm.
I'm going to fuck it.
I'm going to look for you.
Let's see how it looks.
Um, wrench.
I love doing series.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And now...
Close guy.
East.
East, East, East.
That's cool.
I love that.
That's so cool.
I'm on.
I gotta get a better view than...
Zero.
No.
You won.
Hmm.
Maybe.
You're two.
No, two for a win.
Three.
Whoa.
Uh-huh.
Holy shit.
Four?
Oh, what?
What is this?
Oh, god.
Oh, it's interesting, huh?
Nice shot.
Yeah, like on the most actually.
I like that.
This is so cool.
This is the atmosphere.
This is the same material the pose is made of.
I mean, not like literally, but like...
Visual language.
Yeah.
Visual language wise.
This is the same color as this.
And then the player is also this color.
At first until they get the paint.
Uh, they actually...
Hmm.
That's why I like this.
I'm thinking so much of this show.
But it's it.
And that's why I love it.
It's artistically wonderful.
No, artistically wonderful.
No, artistically wonderful.
It's wonderful.
Thunderfuck.
Thunderfuck.
Thunderfuck.
Thunderfuck or...
Yeah, wonderful.
And then I do.
I go into Discord.
I go into production.
Oh, dude.
That was beautiful.
Holy shit.
Mine.
I gotta...
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Very dizzy.
That was cool, though.
Oh, dude.
It was cool.
Yeah, it was really cool.
Oh, Carlos.
Carlos.
Yes.
It's my all.
It's your smile.
It's your smile.
Yes.
Carlos.
That was really cool.
Did you guys?
I love you.
Yeah, we're practically done with these jumps.
That's it.
Okay.
All right, I had a question with it.
Um, anyway.
Okay, she's far back.
Oh.
Did I just show you this?
Okay, I showed you that.
You did those off on my phone a lot.
Sorry.
Yeah, I go ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping.
I did this.
I'm like, I work in their phones to highlight it.
And I was like, it's got 56 new messages.
I was like, oh, wow.
I slowly skinned through that when I knew.
Do you know?
Oh, see?
This is what I had before.
If it's work is...
That's pretty cool.
If work is really slow, then I'll go through it as it's coming up, but if I'm busy, I have to wait.
I was like, holy shit, you post really fast is what I wanted to say, but I don't have anything that I contribute to.
When you can't say something, you can, I have your list as a colleague.
You can even pitch in and say what the fuck you want. Just don't spoil the game, please.
No, I'm not.
The only time, all a minute, the only thing I've showed was some of those designs.
Oh no, that's totally okay.
So what we'll keep what we talk about, between us, keep that between us.
But if we have our hairs, fuck it, send videos, pictures, I don't care.
Because he's always next to me when I'm holding my phone going through, and he's like, why are you so interested in him like this?
He's only going to do his help.
I told him not to tell him anything, so he keeps asking me what it's about.
And I was like, it's just a really awesome video game you have to wait.
He says he wants to play it when it comes out, just because I'm hyping it up to him.
Well, you can jump some bits like this as gorgeous.
Oh man.
He says it better be good.
He says it better be good.
He's an asshole.
Yeah, let's get a better shot of this.
I'm just excited. I want to be so stoked when we can actually play this.
And I'm going to run around everything.
I'm going to, I know what this is.
I can use all three of these to scatter it.
But this is going to stay, because that's...
No, it doesn't.
He's not being a piece of it.
This is not the wrong place.
This is in the wrong place, I should say.
I'm going to love that shot too.
This is all scale.
Remember, like I said, except the sun.
The sun is the only thing I need to do.
I'm not sure if everything is just scale actually.
I need to fix them.
I need a really stupid thing where I can't.
Is this a long one of the pillars?
Yeah, one of the Alice pillars.
One of the Alice Tyler's ditches I should say.
I've got to short them like them too.
Now it's too easy.
Like it should be.
Imagine this is kind of a scaffolding.
They're taking these two points.
They're like, okay, I'm going to attach here, here, here.
Are you building a good tree?
I'll see what you do.
It's going to be a city.
Yeah, a righteous zone.
I can get it now.
Let's put this.
It's more accurate actually.
Where's like center mass?
That's like...
Now it's on that one thing.
That's like it's like this.
Does that feel right?
I am, aren't I?
No.
What if that's not about a thing?
Being inside this thing?
No, I don't know.
What if this is like an aesthetic difference?
Just to get the player attention that it's there.
It's slightly perspectives.
You can always move it around in the more you get your detail in.
That's true.
Oh, good.
Oh, yeah, that's zero.
Huh?
Got it.
This is...
It's just the player camera.
Okay.
Let's move it back around.
Let's see what we want to do.
Yeah.
I'm not zero.
I'm just not impressed.
Where to go?
Back up, back up, back up.
What would it do?
That is weird.
Yeah, that's good.
It's safe here.
Crush Rosé.
I just started.
I was trying to watch it.
I was trying to watch it.
I'm trying to watch the process, I should.
Yeah, it was for a second.
I had a fight right back to begin.
I was working with...
What?
Yeah, I won.
I was at...
Oh, it wasn't, it wasn't.
Oh, when that's the side,
and then, let's see, tab again,
and then I want locations.
Move this over...
Oh, that's not what I wanted.
One of my zeroes is what I wanted.
Got the camera.
Hold on, everyone's outside.
I'm all right, you're right.
Damn, over a second.
Hmm.
You zero.
Assist me.
Off.
Okay, so what if...
I did...
Christ.
Hmm.
Not just too much.
Give it some more.
Stupid.
Here it's almost stupid.
There's one of the things.
People like to say...
I wanted to move the town.
I wanted to move this around the town.
So the town should be in zero.
That's why they're all fucked up.
Looks that shit.
Back to the tangent.
Christ got damn it.
I've just had a hard time with this.
Sometimes, I'll try to work him focused.
But it's fun.
I'm doing a little, little while making it
a little more of an interesting scene.
So let's go back to branch.
Oh, four.
Show him what the fuck out.
I don't have to do anything.
No, you want to hang out?
Good to hang out with that for a little while longer.
Look at that.
You can see the contrast there.
Yeah.
That's what you're trying to get.
What if it's my business?
That's too much.
It's overwhelming.
What if it's the shocker I'm with?
Yeah.
That's one of the smallest.
I don't like that there.
Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
Yeah.
You can see a little bit of all of that.
But he did an intro shadow here.
It's like...
It's like, ooh, that's fucked up.
I mean, I could do this.
That's ridiculous.
It's ridiculous.
I'm fucking about.
Oh, okay.
I should be more on you. That's what I should do.
More on the fucking scene.
Did you?
Did you?
Okay, okay. Like that.
Oh, it's pretty down.
Whoa.
Oh, it's okay then.
It's better letting me.
Not like that.
Like this.
What is that like that?
What is that like?
It's all too sorry and things don't chase Christ.
I'm moving to the right.
Nope.
Wow.
One night, why is that different?
No, that'll help.
Yes.
What do you think?
If this is trying to demonstrate the length of this structure,
I have her back yours.
Tell me.
I don't know about that.
Yeah.
That creates more depth. That's cool.
Oh, that's what you're trying to do.
So you need to freeze out from too far from the effect from the fall from.
Fall from.
Fall from.
You want to create more depth to the view.
Yeah.
So now that's going to be crazy.
I'm going to fucking nightmarish levels.
All right, so what I got to do here is take the background.
And we're going to serve to the building.
Oh, but it's part of the background.
So I've got to take this canvas and move it over to the locations.
I have.
Over area.
It's creating your empty.
Branches.
No, we're not branches.
Close.
Close.
Wow, that was strong.
Very pronounced.
Okay.
Now I'm going to go back to the background.
I'm moving the universe, the planet shell.
Shell and atmosphere.
Everything around it.
But this is because I'm fucking living together.
I've got to choose it.
So I don't want to do this.
See what all three points are moving.
I'm working with the structure.
There.
Last one.
Okay, so I'm not going to take these carefully.
And bring them back out.
I'm trying to get the smallest point.
And then kind of put further out, kind of like to test the space.
Because this is like the, the whole area, right?
The most regimented in the middle.
So if I can take the rest here.
So.
Close to grace.
Close.
Close branches.
Kind of damn it.
Just.
These also works.
They're easy to dance.
Close branches.
Atlas tether, you know.
To me.
Atlas pillar.
And they should just try to pull it out.
Atlas pillar.
Atlas tether is really cool because that's how it works in space.
Yeah, fucking Atlas tether.
Okay, do what I want.
I'm talking myself again.
I'm talking myself again.
Good point.
Thank you for that.
Appreciate it.
Not for seizures just, you know.
Where it's mean nothing unless you actually understand the meaning.
You're right.
Which is why I don't see why everyone is so busy about how I talk.
Well, if you understand me, why is it a problem?
Oh, no, you're fine when you are.
I just think that typically when you're taxed, it's a bit different.
Everyone keeps trying to correct my grammar.
I go, yes, I'm very aware my grammar is horrible.
Yes, I'm very aware.
I'm very aware because I'm corrected by everybody on a daily basis.
Do I care?
Not necessarily.
If I did, it probably would have changed my mind.
But I like saying things like me is hungry.
What?
Oh, yes.
Sure.
I is hungry.
I is hungry.
You know, I said food.
I said foods is...
I'm irritated, but I said foods is I like foods is...
It's just like my grammar of tingle, tingle, tingle, damn right.
And I go, yes, I is hungry.
She doesn't know what?
Yes, I is hungry.
She's like, that don't make any sense.
I was like, yes, grammar, I want food.
She's the only person I'll correct it off.
Because if I try to do that with her, she gets really confused very easily
because I'm no longer speaking Spanish.
You're no longer keeping up keeping up to date with her.
No, social say something in Spanish and I'll say something funny in my horrible English.
And it will throw her off if it's not really good at English.
Where is it?
Are you trying to cover it completely?
I'm trying to immerse the player in the force.
In the brain?
Regis.
It's pretty immersed if you look in there.
Yeah, but it's like it's too dense or something.
I think it feels too harsh for me.
I want to make more open but it's the same time when I sacrifice everything, you know.
Take it out a lot of people.
I think.
Huh?
Maybe going to have it too.
I'll take some stuff out of you.
That's okay.
I'll just make it.
What is the most interesting part here, I think?
Out of these two.
There's three I should say.
What is?
I was going to say you can move that one over that way.
Where the?
Oh.
Give it a little more space.
Pull it out.
And then with this one, which one do you think is worse for claustrobia?
Like this?
I don't know.
Then I'll put it all this way.
Because that's so...
Like that?
That's really empty.
There.
Another perspective.
Another perspective.
Another perspective.
Neither mother nor another perspective.
Okay.
Do do do.
That's so cool.
I don't know.
Let's go back.
Where does it grab everything?
I don't know.
Why do you have a camera here, dammit?
Let's try to love him.
Keep working the perspective.
Because it's a great.
That's so useful.
It's not straight ahead of it.
I'm going to look up in the fucking sky.
I'm really...
Oh, hey, what is that?
All right.
Okay.
No further.
I might need two perspectives here.
I don't know.
Fuck it.
I'm excited.
I'm going to do a little bit.
Just a little bit.
Yes.
Perfect.
Yeah.
I like it.
I like it.
Okay, but I don't know.
That line is fucking my brain.
Haha.
I'm going to open my cats butt.
Shit.
Back.
Where is it going?
Back.
Where is it going?
That's when you need to make a camera.
I'm going to do it.
Like you're doing that.
Wow.
That's trippy.
Okay.
I'm going back to my class.
It.
Where is the layer right here?
Fuck it.
Fuck it.
Create a camera.
There you go.
Eyesets.
Line with you.
So this is what the in-game camera sees.
This is what the engine sees.
Right now it's a little fucked up because I don't have a background.
Yeah.
It's genitals bulging the background.
That doesn't make it so weird.
Okay.
How do I need a DVD right here?
Not music.
Music.
Okay.
That's nice.

Dota is a third-person adventure game with non-combat mechanics.
Not necessarily, you're addicted to a slice of life kind of thing.
So imagine that you're...
There's no combat because there is no conflict.
Not violent conflict.
It's all interpersonal conflict.
That what exists.
I mean, there are areas of violence.
Violence does happen kind of time.
But it's rarely ever lethal, rarely ever fatal.
And what it is, it's...
It's serious, but people have a hard time understanding.
Because this is...
How could you manage to ever be so violent?
This is kind of a...
Articulation...
Articulation is still how to make people better socially.
It's being bring them closer together, making them more trusting of each other.
Take the space.
The physical constraints of the space, being these vertical structures.
And you're building a civilization around that limited space.
Which means no cars, no roads.
You have community networks.
You have blimps.
You have monorails.
You have...
You don't have...
This is...
I'm trying to give you a scientific bit of it.
So there's no teleportation.
There's no fashion like travel.
It's basic.
No physics to the best of my knowledge.
Which is why I won't ever...
I'll refrain from doing the whole black hole thing for a while until they parse it out.
Even though I have an idea, I think that...
I don't want to trust the experts on their understanding of it.
Because we're getting better and better.
And every sex or gesture...
Successive generation is contributing to it and challenging that of their ancestors.
So it's like they're still building a better knowledge.
In the world context and in the real world.
It's a madness.

We can only muscle in one given area of the brain at the time.
We can't multitask, that is to say.
You're getting the habit of this fear here.
You're thinking different from the brain.
This is the only memory stored and it's like...
Some regions are more biologically adapted than others for certain tasks.
Certain behaviors.
Sometimes reach much into it because we think that we have consciousness, but we really don't.
It's just the same as everything else.
We have self-awareness, but sort of cats, sort of dogs.
They don't have the ability to express through language.
They don't have the ability to express through behavior, right?
We have behaviors that bring us closer and more socially.
We read abstractions onto our emotions.
Imagine aggression, right?
And dogs.
Aggression, right?
They're ready for...
Easy.
Yeah.
Can your teeth, right?
Right.
Ah!
Ah!
Well, their muscles tend to feel their skin.
And it's like...
Fools in the area.
Yeah.
It looks like it's an extreme intense.
And you have...
Fear.
Adjacent to that.
But I'd say that's the way of putting it.
Fear is the most basic.
Because anxiety builds into anxiety with adrenaline.
Build into anxiety or fear.
The fight or flight thing, right?
But it's more complex enough.
Because anxiety also affects jealousy.
And affects everything else.
But anxiety goes on like an...
Imagine you have two wings, right?
And you have another...
Another third wing coming in between Adjacent.
Going out.
This is anxiety as it curves out into behavior.
How anxiety...
This...
This biological trait that exists in everything.
It's...
It's so ingrained in us.
But it affects every aspect of nature.
It's okay.
That was the timing.
Let's save that.

All right.
I guess I would have picked it up on the ramp.
Can you clear off me?
Longer.
Oh, longer.
Emma?
Emma?
Emma?
Don't look at your hemorrhage.
Stop pressing over there.
Pressing over there?
Yeah.
Like, does anyone?
No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm gone.
Sorry, I had to go.
I'm over here.
Get the tape around.
This...
You going?
No.
Turn it off.
Right here.
Right here.
Hold this for me.
Don't want to go up with it.
Okay.
Okay, I've got to do it.
And figure out that it's a little bit of the way.
Thank you.
Just barely.
A little bit.
That's what I should do.
I should be getting the tape.
All right, that's all.
Okay, I'll play with that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hold it.
Come on.
Come on.
Okay.
How are you?
All right.
Come on, pull this thing up.
Come on.
All right, come on.
Combine that space.
Like take that thing back out.
Pull this one there and put that one there.
That was larger, actually.
Let's get the core space.
Yeah.
I always know that.
Yeah.
You better just bang down.
Okay.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

That's for your cut.
Did I interrupt you?
I didn't get it.
I didn't get it.
Yeah, that's why I didn't get it.
I need to stick it.
I need to stick it.
Oh, I'm not going to stick it.
That was probably...
It's supposed to be for this.
I didn't measure it out, but I can have a big deal with it.
I don't know if I need it.
I don't get it.
That's nice.
It should.
First thing I'm going to do with it is...
I'm going to stick it.
I'm going to stick it.
I'm going to stick it.
I'm going to stick it.
I'm going to stick it there.
Okay.
Oh, look.
Come closer, come closer.
Come closer.
Come to me.
We ready?
We ready.
Okay.
Okay.
You can do that.
Okay.
To the right.
To the right.
To the right.
I need to turn down.
I just need to turn up a little bit.
I can still hear it.
Can you?
Why do you really believe me?
Okay, I can hear you.
Please, give me your attention.
All right.
Right?
Okay.
No.
I need to use the pressure.
Yeah.
I think this is because it probably needs a lot of attention.
Can you turn down a little bit?
Nevermind.
Yeah, I can.
That's right.
Well, that's right in your way.
No, I can't.
I can't bite that much.
I'm not sure.
I think we're just, uh, or something.
Anyway, it was like, makes it.
It was like, hey, stop, stop, stop.
Makes it a piece of music.
I don't know if that's always.
It's not the better stuff.
It's more like a, uh, a hand you're wasting.
You're burning, you're burning, you're burning.
That's probably what it was.
Anyway, we're holding it from the wall.
So it's up to 10 seconds, and we're still here.
And catching it was five seconds.
We're using seven.
I don't know.
Really? Super cozy?
It just gives me up.
It's all open, aren't we?
Yeah.
But it's mostly facing me, unfortunately, I'm like, great.
Can you hold it?
Can you hold it?
Can you hold it?
What?
Is that for people who are more than one?
Is that for people who are more than one?
Yeah.
Look at my back.
The Christmas.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think it was talking about drinking.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that was what worked with the Soviet Union, because I was getting sick and all of these
things out there.
They were just going to keep letting you in this moment.
And they were feeding you.
Stick around with this.
Like, the factory already has a lot of companies from this.
I don't want to ask you.
Why are you using your body?
You can show up on the workspins.
You just want to work this out.
You just want to work this out.
You just want to work it out.
Make sure you hold it up when you're trying to press.
What if it's just walking around?
You're going to get a boyfriend at the end of the room, so you can do a job.
What?
What do you think?
No, I mean, I was just sorry, because I felt okay.
I felt sorry for the car or something.
I think it's too hot.
That's a bit of a stick, church.
I don't know, I don't know.
Maybe it's just a stick.
What?
Maybe it's just a stick.
What would that be good?
Maybe it's over here.
I love it.
I love how it goes.
Well, you're going to have to go to bed soon, you know, right?
Yeah, but it's time for my glasses.
So I can choose a seat for a car to our...
Can you handle that?
Yeah, just do that.
All right.
How are you?
It's good.
Five or six hours.
Wait, right now, I have to go in the car.
It's a spaceship for me.
Yeah, it's still going to happen.
What are you doing up there?
Yeah.
I just, like, I hate to sleep.
I don't function well.
That's it.
I get...
I don't know why my default when I'm tired and I'm not feeling good is...
I'm angry.
But my default when I'm tired and I'm not feeling good is...
Unfortunately, I think it's who I'm not super angry.
I'll finish.
What do you think?
I'm worried about the saying here.
I mean, there's a stress or a homemaker expressing frustration
that maybe your personal life is your dad's life.
You're an interperson life here.
In our process of yourself.
What are you following?
What are you doing up there?
I'm not feeling good.
Oh, you're...
You're not feeling good when it's contributing to it, didn't you?
Did you write it before?
It's actually better.
What's up?
What are you trying to do?
I was trying to make this better.
I'm not private, but, like, you have to learn jokes
and I don't think I can touch them.
I'm looking at you.
I don't know.
No, I want to see me, but it's also...
I don't want this.
This is just...
This is just journalism.
This is just star space, pretty much.
Oh, right.
It's a room.
Yeah.
It makes sense.
I guess it's a room.
Yeah, it's a chill room.
It's a chillout door, isn't it?
Yeah, I don't know.
I just always default in doing what I don't feel good.
I don't know what I was trying to do.
I guess it's super...
All right.
Any reference photos?
The game.
Can I take a reference shot at this?
I guess.
Maybe you'll have more life turning on the truth.
It's just a little bit.
And then I take a picture.
I try to get the...
The real last...
It's a visual...
How do you want me to be more relaxed than I am?
It's your first time you are.
You're super cozy.
Yeah.
Well...
You want a pillow?
New one.
I have.
There's nothing back there.
I need to get you a pillow.
Two pillows, actually.
B or B.
Can we have the ashes?
Yeah.
We'll try that tonight.
The trash.
I'll put it off this side.
All right.
Don't you see?
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
It's okay.
I'm gonna put one over there.
Oops.
Oh, David.
Is there a church?
I think it's too hot.
No, a church.
Oh, it's going on.
Oh.
It's going too much energy.
Is that out of here?
Oh, it is.
Yeah.
Let me see if there's my hypothesis.
It's not showing the breakfast, but it's like...
I can't start one more one.
I don't know, maybe.
Maybe I'll be taking things.
I'll do it with that.
Let's see if I can start.
I'll switch.
I'll switch to either way.
There you go.
Here we go.
There you go.
There you go.
There you go.
There you go.
There you go.
There you go.
There you go.
There you go.
There you go.
There you go.

She was dead.
No standing in the fort.
All right.
I'm glad we're safe.
I'm glad we're safe.
It's been a great idea.
Okay.
All right.

want to do it worse, we'll have two different juxtapces, move the seizures now.
I want to change shifts sometimes but in like my friend Lindsay you want to be or
Asian, I think it's beaches, but she's not really happy.
Sometimes it depends on who you're dealing with.


====== REC093.txt ======
That's in half of those people will choose the same path.
The name.
The person will choose it differently.
Can I give you an example of that?
Yeah.
For a situation that I had in the past.
So I worked at this retail place, yeah.
And, um...
Someone that's still on TV.
I chased after them.
Yeah, I get...
I'm not supposed to do this.
But I go out there anyway.
No one else is following me.
By myself.
I chase after them.
I go to the car.
And then...
I yell out.
Why are you doing this?
And the man says...
He pauses.
He doesn't say much.
He's getting in the car.
He's going to go.
He's...
He's almost in the sea.
He says,
I'm an asshole.
Almost angrily.
Because I'm an asshole.
And he goes in his car.
And...
Not so angrily, not he didn't moderately frustrated with himself.
He doesn't think it's that bad.
Pretty still knows it's not a cool thing to do.
He expected just to get it with them to...
No, only fulfill that for it.
Yeah.
But they got his plates.
Yeah.
And...
Now he's in...
Yeah, custody.
Hopefully it was a minor offense.
Hopefully he got out quickly because it was just TV.
But that's going to fall around with him.
Even though it was miss...
It wasn't intentional to his...
To the degree that he thought it was bad.
It was intentional to the degree that he thought it was...
He felt justified in his actions.
And that's not his...
And not to his fault because of deterministic behavior.
And then we react.
He didn't choose evil.
He didn't believe himself to be evil.
He acted with it.
He's in most acceptable intent.
If it makes sense.
And no one believes himself to be evil.
Put it simply.
I get it, but he's still okay.
Okay, so...
I get that the individual doesn't think they're doing things wrong.
But then again, that's just the interpretation part of where like...
Everyone has their own way of doing things.
They don't...
It's not entirely necessarily wrong the way they're doing it.
It's just that's how they enter on how to do it.
So it's not like...
There's Dylan has five.
Yeah, it's just the way they're acting in their basic fundamental behavior.
And they're...
And they're drive to fulfill whatever...
That's what I was trying to say.
The difference between me and Anna is that...
To me, her mindset is that she's being completely ridiculous.
Like, she's in her own world kind of thing.
Where...
Probably to her and me is the same thing.
So she thinks I'm just living in my own world.
It's being what they do.
Because I've seen things differently than how she's seen.
But in her mind, the way I see her is wrong.
Because she knows what she is.
And she believes what she's doing is what's best.
I'm so cold.
I am so worried.
I don't know how you're feeling.
I feel so...
I am so comfortable to get out.
I can speak.
Maybe you need a chair.
Maybe you need a little thing.
I think that's what it is, Anna.
So that...
It's nothing at all.
And I know the space.
You can't call if there's no space.
There's no space in one of them.
What if you got down here?
And I was over there.
Then I can curl in words like this.
And then it wouldn't be so weird.
And you can just prop yourself up on the corner there and I'll go over there.
Okay.
Yeah.
That way it's like...
It's both of us.
It's two of us.
All right.
Okay.
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Yeah.
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Yeah.
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Not that cold.
Not sweetie.
Three twin twin.
If I got the wrong...
If I had been well-intentioned,
if I hadn't done it like that, I guess.
If I'd make that more confusing, this was like...
I wouldn't be able to get it.
You were trying to figure it out and it wasn't working.
You got me out.
You got to move out so I can get it.
Yeah.
Because my foot's behind the chair.

====== REC096.txt ======
Dodeck is a third-person adventure.
Night in the woods asks slice of life, community building game with a hint of metroidvania
and a mirror's edge and a comb-rater.
You're exploring the vertical dark souls, like level design that spans.
What looks to be, looks to go on for as far as I can see.
But in Roundy I'm working towards building those boundaries.
There's little obstacles to players and player encounters.
The crystals I showed you.
They're blocking the path for the player to progress forward.
There are minor roadblocks in the day-to-day travels, but they unlock more and more as they go in.
Eventually they hit a roadblock so enormous that the player is to stop.
And this is where I built backwards, I built back into the city.
Imagine they get all the way to the entrance.
They need to do next. They have to travel back.
They have to go back to the very edge of the city now.
They have to go upwards.
Oh, they have to go upwards. Yeah, that's more interesting.
They have to go for the endless tether.
To a civilization that is far above them.
And this fibosilization is...
I really want to fan.
It's more of an entrance into the tomb.
An entrance into the vast caverns of the Atlas tether.
So you're putting me up. You're going from there to...


====== REC097.txt ======
So imagine you're building me up, you start in a little office, you are what known to people to be the Dodec.
And the Dodec is a Dodechedrin.
You take the form of a... Oh geez, step him back.


====== REC098.txt ======
Okay, so the player starts out as like a, what I'd call a neuron, my little spark.
And they're, they're throding back and forth into space.
Eventually the spark is larger and larger and larger and larger until eventually.
It's, it's almost tapping at the sides like a snake and eventually that's the player growing.
They can kind of move around on the stuff.
There's bigger and bigger, I get t t t t t t t t t.
And then there's lights beating you along this path.
And then lights go right, go right, right, right, right, left, left, left, right,
fort, fort.
Down, the issue is the player had a move and then how to use the camera.
And then using lights to direct him in the way that needs to be conveyed to give them
a proper tutorial. So imagine.


====== REC099.txt ======
So imagine you have your hands, no no, yeah, okay, imagine you have your hands, you have control on your hands.
And there, you know, no controller works typically, people with it, and looks at it.
Well, you think that, but I think it's surprising, but most people don't know how.
They don't have the foundational knowledge to use controller. It's a bad game design.
Someone born away from video game consoles as they exist.
And you put them in a situation and try to learn it, there's no intuition to build from.
You have to even portal 2 doesn't have basic controls for looking with the mouse. It's assumed.
It's connected to the analog stick.
That and with keyboard and mouse, it's not displayed.
And I don't think it's displayed for me, maybe, on analog stick, I don't know.
But either way, these games are fantastic at it.
Anyway, going back to G-Screen.


====== REC100.txt ======
Where's the remote from the other guy?
Where'd he put it?
Oh, it doesn't matter.
Okay, whatever.
I'm sorry.
I didn't think I'd just explain this otherwise.
Uh, so I imagine.
Hmm?
Oh, yeah, thank you.
Just real quick.


====== REC101.txt ======
Okay, well this is one-on-one.
I thought this was the highest we've gotten in terms of number of notes.
Anyway, actually I've got a couple thousand already.
Like, through all these conversations.
Not sure if I've had conversations with other people.
To kind of ideate, ideate, ideate, ideate, I think Leo and I have a lot of fun next time.
We've got to build this.
Please, touch it.


====== REC102.txt ======
Right now, I'm working on the dialer system with Molgato, but when we're done with that, I need to focus on movement.
And I think one of the best methods to work around the floating point limitations,
kind of movement, would be to have a...
I've got the term you can tell me once.
You'd have a horizon-chased turbo, kind of panoramic effect.
All right.
How are the fucking term?
Oh, that's...
Playpad went the fuck? That's tiny. Small map.
We're probably a good reference if it's difficult.


====== REC103.txt ======
Like an endless runner, but in preset directions, in handcrafted directions.


====== REC104.txt ======
Oh, this is gorgeous.

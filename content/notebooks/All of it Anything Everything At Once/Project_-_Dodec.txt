====== Dodec: Beyond Our Home ======
A thing I have regretfully been tinkering on for about 5 years now. -

A planet one-hundred-times the size of the Earth (with an idea of gravity increasing as the mass of the planet climbs: so too, does the atmosphere) Cities scaffolded onto sixteen towering megastructures dubbed Atlas Tethers. They scale upwards and outwards on the exterior of the structure: puncturing drills into the surface to attain a reliable source of clean water and service the water's flow for power enough to light entire cities.

The towns of Maria where you are born- are home to traveled to the planet and established a colony there. The city is located on a planet called Chione, which is 100 times the size of Earth and has two giant rings surrounding it. These rings are held in place by tethers and are inaccessible to the people of Grand Voss. The game's themes focus on preserving history and creating a positive vision for humanity's future. The story is set in a world where the stars in the night sky are disappearing, which raises concerns about the future of Earth's sun. The player controls a modular machine that interacts with other characters in the game, explores the world, and fixes things. The game emphasizes the importance of preserving the history of the stars through oral tradition, creating a better world through technology and design, and fostering community growth through shared work.
Dodec: Beyond Our Home is a science-fiction game set in a sprawling cityscape known as Grand Voss. The game takes place on the Super-earth of Chione, a world that is blanketed by an endless ocean so dense and deep that no probe has survived its depths. Chione has sixteen Atlas Tethers, incredible towering structures that range in humidity, temperature, and size, each encircled by waterfalls that flow continually in fresh water. The trio of moons on Chione are named Arcturus, Boreas, and Dionysus.
The game revolves around interstellar travelers who set out on a fit of advancing technology to the stars. Humans live forever now in this futuristic setting, as eternalism has become a human right. The story takes place after humanity has spent 500,000 years on a journey between stars and planets. Grand Voss encircles two encapsulating rings, each with a centrifugal zone, that are supported by 16 Atlas Tethers that use the world's oceans and a hidden energy reserve to remain sturdy.
The night sky is going dark, and the stars are disappearing, leaving only faint infrared observations. The game centers on the mystery of the disappearing stars and the significance of Sol's pulses of light that have no discernible patterns of information. The player controls a modular machine that navigates around the cityscape of Grand Voss, fixing things and exploring the world.
The game emphasizes the importance of preserving the history of the stars and humanity through oral tradition, and making the world a better place through humane actions. The Heat System, Conversation System, and Traversal System are key game mechanics, encouraging players to best manage heat and to engage with various systems to repair and explore Grand Voss. Dialogue System allows players to use two modes of expression called 'Enacts' that can affect how characters act the player or others. The Traversal System allows the player to explore the cityscape of Grand Voss. Transport options include blimps, trolleys, bullet trains, hot air balloons, hang gliders, and parachutes.

In conclusion, Dodec: Beyond Our Home is an innovative science-fiction game that combines rich world-building with a strong narrative focus on preserving history and bettering the world through humane tradition and actions.
You are born to life way above the great oceans of a super-earth 500,000 years from Sol. 
Sight to cities sprawled upwards by stairs, lifts- wild technology of mobility- all to the heavens and deeper, closer to the surface. Dubbed, Chione. 16 enormous spires aligned across the axis of a world one-hundred times the size of the Earth but 1.44837e+07
Dodec: Beyond Our Home is a sci-fi adventure game that takes place in a sprawling city-scape known as Grand Voss. The city is home to the remaining interstellar travelers who journeyed to the planet and established a colony. The world is surrounded by two immense planetary rings, each supported by 16 active support tethers that hold them in place over the planet's atmosphere. The rings are inaccessible to the people of Grand Voss, and their interiors remain a mystery. The game's central themes revolve around preserving the history of stars and humanity through oral tradition while utilizing technology to create a better world. The focus is on community, renewable energy, and a positive vision of humanity's future.
The story takes place in a world where the night sky is going dark, and the stars are disappearing, leaving only faint infrared observations. The planet's original system is being "muted" in the visible spectrum, causing concern that Sol, the old home of Earth, may suffer the same fate. The game's events explore the mystery of the disappearing stars and the significance of Sol's pulses of light that have no discernible patterns of information. Grand Voss is encircled by two encapsulating rings that are supported by 16 active Atlas Tethers. These tethers hold the rings in place, preventing too much loss of energy and potential chemistry in the atmosphere.
In the game, the player takes on the role of a modular machine that forms great ties with people in the community. The character fixes things, explores the world, and forms a mental model of it while meeting people and finding shortcuts. The game aims to keep the sci-fi elements grounded in real-world understanding without relying on tropes of dystopia. The overarching theme is that humans are now capable of living for as long as they choose to, given that eternalism is considered a human right, along with the right to choose death. The game emphasizes that we must preserve the history of the stars through oral tradition, better the world through creation, design our cities in consideration of the ecosystem, and pay attention to NPCs to foster community growth through shared work.

Locations & Setting:
Chione (Maria)
The Super-earth of Chione world of Chione: she’s blanketed by an endless ocean- its waters so dense, so deep- that no probe has ever survived its depths. Chione has sixteen Atlas Tethers, incredible towering structures that range in humidity, temperature, and size, each encircled by waterfalls that flow continually in fresh water. 
Her trio of moons are dubbed Arcturus, Boreas, and Dionysus.
Maria
The townscape of Maria and scales in all directions- the vertical towns wrap and wind to reach far, wide- deep into Chione’s great sky: 
West-Town
This side of the city-
Boreas (Grand Voss)
Grand Voss
Home of the Allied Civil Preserve (ACP) A branch of the Starbound that saw the very existence of these megastructures as something that might pose them difference “if they would wake up” or so return home.  

The militarized manufacturers that sought to ‘defend’ humanity against whatever threats they might face from the super-civilization that built megastructures that span Chione. 
Boreas (Grand Voss) The child moon of Chione, is shaped into machinations of mass production, employing production lines with ranks of war-ready machines; repurposed for local maintenance and repair.
The city of Grand Voss: settlement on the moon, Boreas. Chione’s dubbed the natural name ‘Boreas’ before people decided to give it a new settlement. 

Caridad

World Technology
Autonomous Repair
The towns are maintained by deliberately simple machines set to routine tasks, and the transportation system includes dirigibles, trolleys, ziplines, lifts, and hot-air balloons.
Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)
The energy needs of this civilization are met by solar collectors, 'thermal converters', and Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). 
Vertical Scalers
This device would enable you to quickly transit vertical sections of built-space without relying on stairs, ramps, or elevators. The device is situated against the surface of this structure you’d go to scale: walk up to it, set your hand on the grip, put your foot on the foot-pedal beneath it and then press a button. The devices releases 
Scaler: vertical-lift with pedal
Autonomous explorers have discovered several habitats optimal for human life along the northernmost Atlas Tether called Maria. The planet's civilizations have many means of variable energy storage and access, including Hydroelectric Energy Storage and solid-state batteries, and have developed an array of energy storage and access technologies. 

The pulley battery system is also in use, which exerts the force of the body to convert kinetic energy into potential energy.
Narrative Components
“We must carry the names of stars through oral history, do with less so that others may have more, and design our cities in consideration to the ecosystems that are present.”
The game has strong themes about our nature and being of service to others.

MDA & The Player Character:
The player character is a weighty, cumbersome machine in a comparably less-dense cityscape. A tall, lumbering thing of cheap iron- repurposed from war into utility as a mechanical helper. 
People of the world will see good recognition of you as something that used to bring violence and war to this place. (oh-so almost breaking the fourth wall in saying all the games we tend to) the mechanics of conversation are now so much more compelling than combat, aren’t they?
a machine that can morph into different forms: their design has been modified to repair and maintain. and rolling mode. 
Wooden Boards & Your Weight
All of the world is much softer than you are: movement is not uncomfortable or slow- each bit of motion is weighty- extremely emphatic of the movement and impact they are having in the steps. The ground would shake on their first step from this deep slumber: you would see all the floorboards beneath your feet shake- dust plooming up and the sound reverberating to everything in the room. Someone might shriek at how much impact there was in that step.
There are bookshelves all around you, tables with fragile dishes; decorative items, and light furnishings. Tread lighting and you would not cause so much destruction. This costs a lot of resources, is realistic; and fun to do, but characters would not want to see their home broken apart. They have ‘an off switch’ to the player should they need it. This is very interesting to witness the first time. The player can protest by expressing the socially-related enacts.
Give them control back and you will only see they might cause less destruction because of the wild thing of an NPC telling them ‘no’. Listen and there’s more game to be had, you might think and give listen to what else they have to express-on. In this way, there is a through-line for the expectation of giving characters attention in conversation if you want best-interaction.
Gravity & Breaking Boards
If the player 
If they fall a ways; they might break boards and fall still. Three board-walks, maybe two- and the game has a system to ‘catch’ and release the player again. Usually guard rails prevent them from going over the edge and we’ll make them metal to afford this ability. The railed edges of the vertically-spanning world can be damaged or entirely ‘destructed’. 
World-Items & ‘Collecting’
There is an advancement to this mechanic in my greatest scoped idea for it. We would have a basic system for selecting items in your inventory. The player character cannot ‘drop items’ on picking them up unless ‘rotated to’ and ‘selected out’ to drop or to initiate an item for a prompt. 

In rotation, the player character would ‘lift an item to their view’ from a bundle of stuff in their hands (one or both) and then, too- be able to hold stuff under their arms. We would need two systems for carrying, they are not mutually exclusive: I would want to be realistic about what someone might be able to carry without a backpack or infinite, intangible inventory space, but we can make it fun, not frustrating, and accessible all at once.
You are your name in life
Oskidere, a machine beloved by many in what they have done for all those others. If you held good heart of everyone that asked of you: the characters, they would keep dearest value in what you might afford them still. They would know you in either this positive affect: or in a way of negation had you not done anything or not enough. 

We might design for the negative outcome but the positive one is a route I ‘expect’ nigh-every person to take in this game. It will be difficult to cause any pain to others, you might not have exacting-ability to language in Dodec. Different from Autumn.
Otherworldly Machinations
The game world has seemingly unknowable machines you would encounter. Things that have a mechanical purpose but may be elaborate or difficult to discern at first; —mostly superfluous, but often functional. You might encounter a large clock tower. See that the clock does not strike the bell as expected: someone may be explicit in saying they would one day like to see it work.

You, knowing you’ve ability to repair things, might look for an entrance to the tower; break the door if the thing would keep you from entry. No one lives here, do they? Ah, but there’s a deep history inside. Someone had lived here. There are clock tower parts strewn about and lists of schematics, everything making sense of this large- seemingly over-contrived machine. 

We would flip the player’s expectations on their heads frequently. This is just a clock tower.
You would wander about, see what parts you might collect in your storage. 
Upgrades & Progression
To reduce your weight, increase your speed, improve your physical resilience; and give yourself new abilities, you might explore the world, talk to characters for tasks and ‘fix things’ to find good reward in what you’re capable of as this machine. 

Spoiler Territory
When we’ve taught the player every mechanic we might imagine and they have a full grasp of the game, what happens? The characters remain, we can still talk to them rhetorically. Listen to them. Talk to them using text boxes or voice. — Even after all of the major narrative loops have been closed: the most pressing ones resolved, we might still build out the world’s lore, add on to its mystery, invent more world events, design & implement new characters.
But the player, how would we encourage them to explore the world again? 
Say we only sold them for 16 hours of ‘main content’- even if the dialogue system and all our best-designed mechanics makes it fairly open-ended. We would design a route for all people as an introduction to the game world and all its interrelated parts. Then- then we flip a switch and turn the game on its head. This is where we do a 180: the player has, up to this point, had such incredible patience, we designed the main features to give them good-engagement for small tasks. They grew to know people, got to know the world; but something changes all at once at the final act. After the credits, this part two is now open to them. 
Upend the idea of you being a slow, cumbersome machine. You have maximally replaced all of your body’s iron parts and overly-weighty systems with lower-mass items: improvements that first gave you sensations of progression. You are as fast as you could be. As well-built, robust as you could be. You have a low-exhaustion rate and deep understanding; competence of it all.
How do we get you to go back to the world all over again, despite ‘knowing it all’?
You have died. The player character has lost their appearance in this death. Return to Chione not known to anyone they held dear of- so distraught is everyone that held recognition of them. “Lost forever, dear Oskidere.”

ALL BELOW IS UNORGANIZED

This one is a sci-fi setting. The 'physical' mechanics of Autumn are difficult still, but maybe we'll find a way to design them later. 'Dodec: Beyond Our Home'
- Humanity has set itself to the stars in a fit of advancing technology: humanity may now live forever. The idea of being eternal does not ruin us. Earth is known to be paradise among the crew of these interstellar vessels. Our old home in good condition and all the world at peace, we may only now see ourselves easy to something so ambitious. --- Slingshot generation ships that set themselves on journeys for hundreds of thousands of years. They swing between stars and planets to find people to new worlds and this journey, the place you've now arrived on was the set course for humanity after 500,000 years on the dotted path.

You awake here to a world built out by hundreds of thousands of years. Megastructures span the skies far and beyond you. Your home is the Super-earth of Chione, its trio of moons in a familial bond.

In the game, the original system is being "muted," causing the night sky to turn dark, but stars can still be observed in the infrared. While Gies, the planet Grand Voss' white dwarf, remains untouched, the stars on Earth are disappearing. The player must manage heat, and if they reach peak temperature, they can be disabled until someone finds and aids them. Players gain various abilities and parts to interact better with the world. These abilities include movement mechanics that encourage engagement with the dialogue system and variability and skill to avoid threshold limits.
Overall, the game encourages non-centric world design, with the player's input not required to show that the world is alive. The player can engage with characters and help repair structures and machines, gaining new abilities and parts along the way. When the player obtains all the mechanics, their body morphs, and they no longer need a workbench or sources of water to prevent being disabled.

In Dodec: Beyond Our Home, players explore Grand Voss, a sprawling city surrounded by two enormous planetary rings, each connected by 16 active support tethers. The night sky is going dark, the stars are falling from our view outright: stars are disappearing, leaving only faint infrared observations. The game explores the mystery of the disappearing stars and the significance of Sol's pulses of light that have no discernible patterns of information.
The game's central themes are about preserving the history of the stars and humanity through oral tradition and making the world a better place through beneficent actions. The player takes on the role of a modular machine, capable of morphing into different forms to explore and repair the cityscape of Grand Voss. The player's interactions with other characters and their ability to give back to the community play a significant role in the game.
The Dialogue System is a key part of the game's narrative. It allows the player to use two modes of expression called 'Enacts' that can affect how characters act towards the player or others. The game encourages prosocial gameplay and player reflection on events.
Players will gain new traversal and repair abilities as they progress through the game and inherit tools that give them the most effective function for fixing things. The player character starts with basic bipedal locomotion and unlocks wheeled mode when the core mechanics are known. They can find various components to improve their task abilities by finding them throughout the world: can be received as gifts.
The transportation system in the game includes blimps, trolleys, bullet trains, hot air balloons, hang gliders, and parachutes. The player will often need to travel long distances to reach new places.
The Heat System, Conversation System, and Traversal System are key systems in the game. 
The Heat System requires players to cool themselves off in sources of water and be mindful of the heat management mechanics, as they may see people hesitant to accept aid. The Conversation System allows players to affect how characters act towards players or others. The Traversal System is essential for the player to explore the cityscape of Grand Voss.
Technology is a central part of the game's world-building. and the Grand Voss' waters are high in salinity. The Atlas Tethers are an array of sixteen towering structures with braces that serve as secondary habitats. Autonomous explorers discovered several habitats optimal for human life along the northernmost Atlas Tether called Maria. The civilizations of Grand Voss have built Hydroelectric Energy Storage, immense basins of water that can act as stored potential energy.
In conclusion, Dodec: Beyond Our Home is an innovative sci-fi game that combines rich world-building with a strong narrative focus on preserving history and bettering the world through humane tradition and actions. The game's systems, including the Heat System, Conversation System, and Traversal System, as well as the transportation system, allow players to fully explore and engage with the game's world.


The Pitch:
Dodec: Beyond Our Home is a futuristic sci-fi game that takes place in a sprawling city-scape known as Grand Voss. The game is surrounded by two immense planetary rings, each supported by 16 active support tethers.
The night sky is going dark and the stars are disappearing, leaving only faint infrared observations. The game explores the mystery of the disappearing stars and the significance of Sol's pulses of light that have no discernible patterns of information.
A modular machine forms ties with people in the community and explores the world, discovering shortcuts and fixing things. The player must preserve the history of the stars through oral tradition and better the world through creation.
It seems like you have a good foundation for your game's setting and central themes, but you need to provide more information on several key systems, including the Heat System, Conversation System, and Traversal System.
You mentioned technology in the game, so could you explain how it will be used to create the game's world?
The Dialogue System sounds important to the game's narrative, so more information is needed on how it will work and how it will contribute to the themes of the game.
The player takes on the role of a modular machine, set in this city-scape, surrounded by bright open skies and towering buildings. The world of Grand Voss is axis-aligned by two immense planetary rings, each supported by a dual array of 16 Active Support Tethers.
The game's central themes are about preserving the history of the stars and humanity through oral, humane, tradition, and making the world a better place through beneficent actions.
Humans are now capable of living for as long as they choose to, given Fortune is in their favor. Some wayward interstellar travelers set home on Grand Voss.
You, living on Grand Voss, have left your people in best situation & awe, but you would never return to them, they are forever lost to the incredible voyage into the unknown.
Story Events
The night sky is literally going dark, but the stars are still observable in infrared. Quasars are left untouched, like the marking stars of old, but will Sol share the same fate?
Grand Voss is encircled by two encapsulating rings, each with a centrifugal zone. The centers are supported by 16 Atlas Tethers, active support structures that use the world's oceans and this hidden energy reserve to keep themselves sturdy against the tides of the oceans.


Player Character
The player character can morph into different forms to explore and repair the cityscape of Grand Voss, and their interactions with other characters and their ability to give back to the community play a significant role in the game.
Players will gain new traversal and repair abilities as they go about the game, and will inherit tools that give best function to fixing things.
When the player attains all the designed mechanics for the game, their body morphs into something else, and they lose the need of a work bench and don't need to cool themselves off in sources of water.
The player can be disabled in the heat management mechanics and may see hesitation bias from people in receiving aid.
Players are intended to always be on the lookout for sources of water in the game, which are related to Nature and give the game strong themes.
The machine player character would take a wheeled and bipedal form, and would have abilities to function in purpose to life and repair.
They can continue to give and idealize others, but the people will not remember them. Giving back will always do better to ground you.
Assume the role of a modular machine built to lift, pull, and re-bind all of the city's major infrastructure. Use learned-tools and given social abilities to give best co-operation to the town's people, restore old technologies to working order, and give insight into what they may have done.
The player starts out with basic bipedal locomotion and unlocks the wheeled mode when the core mechanics are known. They can find new components to improve on their task abilities throughout the world by finding them or being gifted them by people.
Every character the player meets wants to do and accomplish something. If given enough time and willpower, the player can fix things they want to fix.
Transportation
Player will often need to travel great distances to reach new places, and will use blimps, trolleys, bullet trains, hot air balloons, hang gliders, and parachute.
Conversation System
The player is given two modes of expression called 'Enacts' which can affect how characters act towards the player or others.
The player can travel by blimp, trolley, bullet train, hot air balloon, hang glider, parachute, and will often need to travel great distances to reach new places. The game encourages prosocial gameplay and player reflection on events.
and the Grand Voss' waters are high in salinity, but each active support structure, Atlas Tether, is encircled by waterfalls that flow continually in fresh water.
The Atlas Tethers are an array of sixteen towered structures with braces that served as secondary habitats. Autonomous explorers discovered several habitats optimal for human life along the northernmost Atlas Tether called Maria.
After 500,000 years travel with known technology, people have reached Grand Voss. There are many habitats to choose from and water is plentiful.
The civilizations of Grand Voss have built Hydroelectric Energy Storage; immense basins of water that can act as stored potential energy. These world tethers are linked to the rings around Grand Voss and the child moon of Chione.
World Technology
The civilization the player is born into uses Solar collectors, thermal converters, solid-state batteries, Small Modular Reactors, and fusion energy to meet its energy needs.
Pulley battery systems use the force of your body to convert kinetic energy into potential energy, and can be released to pull someone up a staircase.
Culture of the Starbound
People have used life-extension technology to explore new habitable systems, and have already built enormous megastructures, rings with "engines", and two immense rings supported by Atlas Tethers on the planet Grand Voss.
The Starbound people have made efforts to preserve their generation ships, and are en route to the Grand Voss solar system, with its super-Earth and three moons named after Greek gods and goddesses. They have sent probes to gather resources and have started building structures on Grand Voss ahead of their arrival.
The passengers on the Starbound feel a mix of excitement, fear, and uncertainty as they approach their destination, Grand Voss. They are filled with questions about the purpose of the structures they see in the first images from the probes, and what they might find when they arrive.
The passengers reflect on their long journey and the sacrifices they've made along the way, and write in their journey logs about their hopes for their new home.
The Starbound colonists have arrived on Chione, a super-Earth with quadruple moons, and have built structures that scaffold off the atlas tethers to avoid the turmoil of the oceans. However, some people have become complacent and do not fully understand the significance of their new home.
A colony of people have traveled to a new world called Chione and its four moons, where they have built structures using a fictional material called icor. They trust an AI system that represents their good will and ambitions.
The Edict
The player character transforms into an Edict, a crystalline and abstract machine species native to Grand Voss, which has improved mobility and abilities such as a better rolling jump and the ability to bounce off walls and floors for momentum.
Humanity made great efforts to renew Earth's biosphere by designing planet-spanning megastructures that altered the orbits of any retrofitted bodies.
We've developed functional governance that brings an end to earth's exploitation and biosphere decimation, and build sustainable cities.
To-do List
Explain how the Heat System, Conversation System, Traversal System, and Falling mechanic will work, and how the Design Constraints will be used.
Bullet Points:
Tiny wafer-sats will reach near the speed of light and carry data, variable propulsion modes, and an ability to maintain and replicate themselves with limited resources. They will swarm around neighboring stars and convert solar and heat energy into electricity then expend energy to convert that into versatile mass.
The player's improved character controller allows them to travel great distances with the right input and positioning, and can bound off of walls and floors for momentum.
Technology is often dedicated to building a certain type of item within a range of variation. Ambitious colonists can design entities on their own within the system's constraints.

There are builder-type Edict that help humans with construction work and limit potential hazards. They can often dissuade people from fighting by talking in the same way the player does.
The game should feature soundscapes that are calming and not overly quiet, and use an alternative cryptocurrency to fuel a blockchain economy.
The game is set to arrive in the next several hundred thousand years, with large cities and smaller towns. What kind of technology will players encounter?
Story elements:
The game provides players with a unique world-building experience that encourages them to explore and interact with friendly NPCs while reflecting on their own actions and justifications.
General Discussions:
A race of beings called AEI arrived after humanity and offered technology and scientific knowledge in exchange for raising human offspring grown via ectogenesis. There are three types of AEI: soft, large, multi-armed non-threatening police/EMT units, Reagal political/philosophical units with representation in the political space, and humanoid machines.
The game's characters can interject in conversations and a Reader Noxii acts as the devil's advocate. The game takes place in the capital city, Nordis, which was occupied by an opposing military force during the conflict.
Dodec: Beyond Our Home sounds like an interesting sci-fi experience that focuses on positive themes such as community, renewable energy, and preserving history through oral tradition.
Research and reference Indian culture, including medical tourism, street food in Chennai, and the prevalence of English as a secondary language.
Glitch has commissioned Eden to provide input on what an "outdoors" scene would look like from an office window.
Noxii climb with electromagnetic gloves that can overheat and have a limited battery life. If both gloves are lost, the player will "rubber-ball" in a protective suit that they can't control and will land in the HUB.
Glitch wants to make the dialogue important and interesting so that players won't skip through it. He suggests using traditional text boxes and visualizing tangents to keep players engaged and interested.
Glitch mentioned a dialogue system that discourages players from skipping through dialogue by using tangents with traditional text boxes. This system encourages players to pay attention to the dialogue and engage with the characters and their stories.
In a futuristic world, colonists live in virtual reality capsules while their bodies are kept in stasis. Chione has evolved.
Chione's Descended Machines: This section should describe different types of Chione's machines, including their behavior in the game. It should also include information about Chione's culture, significant power groups, products produced in Chione, routes, trails, and notable locations within Chione.
A sci-fi story takes place 500,000 years ago, where humanity has reached a technological utopia. However, the misuse of antibiotics leads to a global epidemic, and humanity's last hope for survival is to construct domed cities with artificial wombs.
The player wakes up in a deserted city, Freya, and must try to escape the renlei forces that invade Freya and make their way to Nordis, where they can join forces with the locals and fight back.
Chapter 7: Final Battle
If the player chooses another way, they must negotiate a peace treaty or sabotage the renlei forces from within, ultimately ending the conflict.
The Pitch:
Dodec: Beyond Our Home is a futuristic sci-fi game that takes place in a sprawling city-scape known as Grand Voss. The city is home to the remaining interstellar travelers who journeyed to the planet and established a colony. The world is surrounded by two immense planetary rings, each supported by 16 active support tethers that hold them in place over the planet's atmosphere. The rings are inaccessible to the people of Grand Voss, and their interiors remain a mystery. The game's central themes revolve around preserving the history of stars and humanity through oral tradition while utilizing technology to create a better world. The focus is on community, renewable energy, and a positive vision of humanity's future.
The story takes place in a world where the night sky is going dark, and the stars are disappearing, leaving only faint infrared observations. The planet's original system is being "muted" in the visible spectrum, causing concern that Sol, the old home of Earth, may suffer the same fate. The game's events explore the mystery of the disappearing stars and the significance of Sol's pulses of light that have no discernible patterns of information. Grand Voss is encircled by two encapsulating rings that are supported by 16 active Atlas Tethers. These tethers hold the rings in place, preventing too much loss of energy and potential chemistry in the atmosphere.
In the game, the player takes on the role of a modular machine that forms great ties with people in the community. The character fixes things, explores the world, and forms a mental model of it while meeting people and finding shortcuts. The game aims to keep the sci-fi elements grounded in real-world understanding without relying on tropes of dystopia. The overarching theme is that humans are now capable of living for as long as they choose to, given that eternalism is considered a human right, along with the right to choose death. The game emphasizes that we must preserve the history of the stars through oral tradition, better the world through creation, design our cities in consideration of the ecosystem, and pay attention to NPCs to foster community growth through shared work.

It seems like you have a good foundation for your game's setting and central themes. However, as you mentioned in your to-do list, there are several areas where you need to provide more information to fully flesh out the game mechanics and narrative.
To start, it would be helpful to explain how the Heat System, Conversation System, and Traversal System will work and how they will contribute to the player's experience. These systems sound like they could potentially be important components of the gameplay, so it would be good to provide more details on how they will function.
Additionally, you mentioned a Falling mechanic, but it's not entirely clear how this will be used to mark progression in the game. It would be helpful to provide more information on this mechanic and how it fits into the overall game design.
Regarding the Design Constraints, it would be helpful to clarify how these will be used to establish the surface area for forests and negative space. This sounds like an interesting approach to level design, but more information is needed to fully understand how it will work.
You also mentioned the role of technology in the game, so it would be helpful to explain how this will be used to create the game's world. Will there be specific technologies that players can interact with, or will the technology be more of a background element that helps to establish the setting?
The Dialogue System also sounds like an important component of the game's narrative, so more information is needed on how it will work and how it will contribute to the themes of the game.
Finally, it would be helpful to provide more information on the Allied Civil Preserve and how it will fit into the game's narrative, as well as the role of the Gyre in the game and how they will contribute to the player's experience.
Overall, it sounds like you have an interesting and ambitious game concept, but more information is needed to fully understand the gameplay mechanics and narrative.


The player takes on the role of a modular machine, set in this city-scape, surrounded by bright open skies and towering buildings. — Those that find home here, in Grand Voss, are the remaining souls of long-voyaged interstellar people; born of Earth who, made a journey to this planet and established a colony. The game's story takes place in a world where the night sky is going dark and the stars are disappearing, but Sol, the old home of Earth, still gives out pulses of light.
The world of Grand Voss is axis-aligned by two, immense, encircling planetary rings; each supported by a dual array of 16 Active Support Tethers, which hold the rings in place over the planet's atmosphere. The secret interiors of these rings are ‘inaccessible’ to the people of Grand Voss and there are only faint wonders at what they would withhold. Of curiosity. Why do the work to hold up such incredible rings? Why does the planet have engines?
The game's central themes are about preserving the history of the [stars & humanity] through oral, humane, tradition; though giving good reliance on technology. Greater, about making the world a better place through beneficent actions and deeds in best valuation of other people. The game is meant to be an optimistic vision of humanity's future, where people are capable of living for as long as they choose to and where eternalism [this ability in technology to live forever] is considered a human right.

It's a sci-fi game but I'm trying to keep it grounded in real-world understandings.
No flashing neon lights, sights of greed, corporations; these tropes of dystopia-
There is a nigh-sacred ideal to our being here and so-living.
Humans are now capable of living for as long as they should choose to, given Fortune is in their favor. (this civilization affords 'eternalism' as a human right, so as the right to choose the end of it in death) Some of these wayward interstellar travelers set home on Grand Voss; their colony ship gave slingshot around the local white dwarf star to slight alteration in inter-system course. The next set of travelers across eons time of space will set foot on the next system this 'generation ship' has seen itself towards.
You, living on Grand Voss. Now historied is the thing of this incredible inter-system generation ship that left you and your people in best situation & awe. You would never return to them, they are forever lost to the incredible voyage into the unknown. Physics is bringing the universe apart we ought to see ourselves to best understanding of all we may reach before the 'stretch' gives us in permanent separation of distance and our abilities of space travel under known laws.

Themes & narrative overview,
Story Events
Our original system is being ‘muted’ in the visible spectrum and the night sky is literally going dark, but, curiously, the stars are still observable in infrared. Quasars are left untouched, like the marking stars of old. Its a terror a horror to see the skies go dark for reasons unknown to us. Stars are quickly disappearing from the night sky; only visible to infrared light. While Gies, the planet Grand Voss’ white dwarf remains untouched, will Sol share the same fate?
Sol, old home of Earth still has pulses of light that are given out. Like a heartbeat but with no discernible patterns of information. Centuries have gone by since the great departure.
Grand Voss is encircled by two encapsulating rings; there is an almost magnetic hold to the atmosphere; greater strength than would-be gravity alone. As if there is a 'powered' pull on the world that keeps material in greater bonds to the planet; preventing too much loss of energy and potential chemistry in way of gases.

Each of the rings is inaccessible to the people that have set foot here; but within each of them, as postulated, are separated, similarly-ringed, centrifugal zones. Middle point having nigh no gravity, and outward push driven to variables not removed from the ideals once seen on earth. Great landscapes of Earth's once nature reside here but the people of

Grand Voss would not see them. Each of these two rings are supported by 16 'Atlas Tethers' that hold themselves and these rings in great scale over the planet's atmosphere; they are active support structures, using the world's oceans and this hidden energy reserve to keep themselves sturdy against the tides of the oceans and all that would weigh them to the planet.
Theme Notes
We once carried the names of stars through oral history and we must do this again if they are to survive into the future | We can better the world through the act of creation | We can do with less so that others may have more (Chione) | We ought to design our cities in consideration to the ecosystems that are present | The homunculus will scratch every itch if we don't pay mind to bounce them around | NPCs operate independent from the player. Community grows through shared work
Systems & player interactions,
Player Character
The player character in the game is a machine that can morph into different forms as they collect parts and gain new abilities. Their main function is to repair the cityscape of Grand Voss and maintain its infrastructure. The player character has a bipedal form for walking, running, jumping and sprinting, and a wheeled form for rolling. They have various means of transportation such as stairs, ramps, pulleys, trams, trolleys, rails, blimps, gliders, planes, hot-air balloons, dirigibles, wingsuits, ziplines and bridges, to help them explore and repair the city. The player's interactions with other characters and their ability to give back to the community play a significant role in the game. The idea is that having resources can lead to alienation, but giving without expecting a return can help ground the player and improve their relationships with others.


An approach to world design that is non-centric towards the player. They may act on the world through mechanics and character interaction, but their input isn’t needed to demonstrate that the someone the world itself is alive without the explicit requirement of player engagement.

Players will gain new traversal and repair abilities as they go about the game. As they find new parts, they gain ability in better interaction with the world. Inheritance of tools that give best function to fixing things; all patterns of 'repair' mechanics relate to maintaining the wayward cityscapes of Grand Voss. Social mechanics differ but likewise enable the aid in repair to structures and machines the player would occupy their attention to.

Characters may give their own effort to projects.

When the player attains all the designed mechanics for the game; the break from this mold of the dodec- as their true personhood as an 'Edict'-
the people of this world would hold a machines rights in alignment to their own;

a meta-material species discovered on Grand Voss. "When the player finds everything they need, their body morphs into something else. The parts they have collected over the course of the game and the literal machinations fall away; the abilities that they’ve collected remain, each of which is given a significant boost in speed and no-so severe requisite needs for resources to make repairs, give social assistance, or physically 'rest' in way of heat dispersal." The player would lose the need of a work bench and would not need to cool themselves off in sources of water to prevent being disabled.
People talk to you different and may not recognize the player as they were. This brings a new stage of player discovery and engagement with people. They are seen anew and cannot give light on whats happened to them.

Heat management mechanics in way of rise to peak temperature; failstate is to be disabled until someone would find aid of you. Characters wander they may see in hesitation bias from people in receiving help; so autonomous are we to these things of giving aid- considered; wondering- so reflecting our own value of another unto them.

The noise the player can make when they are disabled in this neglect of managing heat.

in movement mechanics as shouldered-engagement to the dialogue system; variability and skill to avoid the threshold limits- during gameplay movement as in old systems of limits of stamina in other games. Players are intended (given affordances) to always on the lookout for sources of water. Ponds, streams, falls, puddles, rain, lakes. Lots of water to bring the game strong themes related to Nature and give the systemic-engagement to this thing 'connections' to the world which hold mechanical purpose.
In the aforementioned text, keep mind of the wheeled and bipedal form the player would take. I still not know how to describe them. Given your knowledge of maintaining infrastructure and building great things of architecture, what form would the 'machine' player character take? May you give them description in a form that affords abilities to function in purpose to life and repair?

They remember all these people but the people do not remember them. They can continue to give and may find idealization from them strange and uncomfortable. This ideal of another can separate you from others; but giving back will always do better to ground you. Thank as you may only say-so and they can only give best return. (as Seneca's text describes in another chat of ours)

As the player, assume the role of a modular machine built to lift, pull, and re-bind all of the city’s major infrastructure. Build in your home area; personal HUB. Repair everywhere else. Use a set of learned-tools & given social abilities (in my mention of 'Enacts' in another chat) Do all you may to give best co-operation to the town’s people. Restore old technologies to working order. Give insight as to what they may have done that people had not seen in a long time. Design player movement mechanics around infrastructure maintenance; appearance should reflect of the low gravity environment, too.

(What does this player character look like to you?) I think they should have both a 'wheeled form' and 'bipedal form' to operate. A toggleable but inflexible spine in bipedal mode that lends better weighted utility in things of jogging, swimming, swinging, sprinting, leaping, climbing. Faster movement, less directional control, but longer horizontal jump in wheeled mode. All higher exertion moves add heat. Heat can be reduced by finding water sources or let the mechanical entropic principles of time to withdraw it.

Go over a certain threshold of heat exertion from your core reserve of energy and you will be disabled until someone can find and help you. (or the body recovers) Other ideas for this so I'll have to get back to it. The player can find new components to improve on their task abilities throughout the world by finding them or being gifted them by people. Players start with basic bipedal locomotion then unlock the wheeled mode when the core mechanics are known.
To the player's story, as this machine, you start out under the wing of a local engineer. Quick say on what you'd do quip Emphasis on movement and environment interaction. The player is given novel mechanic-based components over time but no upgrade is without function in the world. Temper their expectations and say when they have the full-set by 'evolving' in this strange aforementioned way they would eventually do in cause of story I have no described yet.
Every character the player would meet has wants and needs to do and then accomplish for themselves; so-between others. They would fix things the player might if given enough time and willpower. If citizens has enough ‘driven’ curiosity to an old technology or place they may set work to repair of give renewal to it. Everyone and the player can find shared meaning and purpose in the game.
Transportation
There are large spans of space without human civilization. Player will often need to travel great distances to reach new places. Travel by blimp, trolley, bullet train, hot air balloon, hang glider, parachute | Central to the globe’s vac-train systems. Maria shuttles people between sister Tethers at speeds upwards of 12,000km/h at peak velocity and serves as main transition site for the Allied Civil Preserve.
Camera System
	perspective 	camera shots could ignite the player's curiosity. choose randomly at 	the menu screen
Conversation System
Given to the player at start are two modes of expression called ‘Enacts’ which can affect how characters act towards the player or others. | consider each enact and their social use for the player; each input must produce predictable outcomes, though it's acceptable to subvert them every now and then. | Happiness expresses a lack of anxiety/aggression. | Respect, honor, (shame) disrespect, distrust, trust. Enmity. Apathy. Closeness, Distance.
Design principles & requisite features,

There are large spans of space without human civilization. Player will often need to travel great distances to reach new places. Travel by blimp, trolley, bullet train, hot air balloon, hang glider, parachute. Support unexpected positive behaviors expressed by the player. Encourage prosocial gameplay in a co-operative environments. Follow the paths of fun and expand upon developing expectations. How might we encourage player reflection on events? All to engagement with things happening to the people in the world; how the player would impose their meaning unto it. Convey that many people here spend time in reflection & creation to make this world. Use humane design to encourage co-operation over competition. Every place the player can see can be found in-game and reached on foot, bike, blimp, or train.


Description of the world & setting,
Grand Voss – The long-traveled super-Earth
 Keeps maintenance with limited automation. (High-salinity oceans conduct lightning). Grand Voss' waters are high in salinity, but each active support structure, Atlas Tether is encircled by waterfalls that flow continually in fresh water. A form of inorganic life exists within the spires and with excavation of the atlas tether’s surface, they’ve fallen like seeds and taken root into our infrastructure. A singular of these things is named a 'dodec' for its 12 faces in the thing of dodecahedron. People think these objects take form into the rare entities known as ‘Edict’. Vertical cities

The rings are not known of. But they contain lush, Nature abundant centrifugal zones with landscapes of nigh fiction to our greatest wonders.

an array of sixteen Atlas Tethers; incredible, towered structures with braces that served as secondary habitats. Sturdy, ringed structures encapsulated in the falls; habitat forming braces scaled along each. that ranged in humidity, temperature, and size. Autonomous explorers were noted to discover several habitats optimal for human life along the northernmost Atlas Tether called Maria. One marked 7000m up from water-level.

Each of these destined planets was encircled by two immense rings and held up by an array of 16 active support structures; each set atop with rotating thrusters.

The atlas tethers are mined for their material; it’s resilient, easy to shape

Encircled by 16 world-moving engines wrapped by two rings that span the equator and poles; mounted atop of active-support structures.
Reached after 500,000 years travel with known technology. We have long lost contact with our home system. Not all in the journey departed from the journeyship that that gave people foot to Grand Voss.

The megastructures have offered people an incredible range of habitats to choose from and the sources of water have remained consistent, clean, and wonderfully abundant.
Along the axis of Chione span 16, immense tree-like structures with exterior falls that keep interiors at invariable temperatures, offering people an incredible range of habitats to choose from. The 6th is where many people call home, but Atlas Tethers range in temperature from extreme heat

Long histories of cultures knowing nothing but artificial skies, accepting in their decision and bearing the sensation of Chione’s exceptionally low gravitational pull despite her sheer surface area.
Extreme heat below the oceans and cold ideal for computation the sources of water have remained consistent, clean, and wonderfully abundant.
Establish a visual theme for the machines. Towns are maintained by deliberately-simple machines set to routine tasks. Lights should be designed to mitigate light pollution.
D irigibles, trolleys, ziplines, lifts, and hot-air balloons.
Conveyor Transit: Designed to be single occupant but modular comp for dual occupancy. carries passengers across moderate gaps between towns. uses propellers to pull itself along the wind tolerant cables


The civilizations of Grand Voss have many means of variable energy storage and access. Namely this one, too; built Hydroelectric Energy Storage: Immense basins of water that can act as stored potential energy; refills from the Atlas Tether falls. I want to call them world tethers now instead of Atlas Tethers.


These world tethers linked to the rings around Grand Voss and the child moon of Chione. Each of these bodies burden themselves with the weight of engines; dispersed across a given axis aligned planetary ring. They are so thought to receive fuel from structures internal to the tethers. But really, the center of the planet is where this energy is kept in physical batteries. Solid-state in complexity and density impossible to our known doings of real-world technology.
Chione
The ACP employs production lines with ranks of war-ready machines. | rather than decommission them, they were retrofitted for use in local maintenance and repair
The days are so slow on Grand Voss colonists are using the moon Chione for their timekeeping | a planet shaped into machinations of mass production.
World Technology
The energy needs of this civilization the player is born into are met by Solar collectors, 'thermal converters' - materials that collect kinetic energy; put it away for storage, and mitigate would be damage to objects impacting or the surface itself. Then solid-state batteries. Small niche, but still-extreme-power cases may call for Small Modular Reactors. Larger human endeavors may call for the thing of fusion energy;
- energy needs are met primarily by the falls, but SMRs are used in propelling flight. SMRs propel tethered shuttle-vehicles between cities

Pulley battery systems; exert physical body to convert kinetic energy into potential energy. Fall to add potential energy to a motorized, spring-returned or (otherwise kinetic storage system). Call it a hand-held highscaler. Pulley battery systems. Exert the force of your body to convert kinetic energy into potential energy. Gears lift a weight that goes into a slow fall. Could double as quick transport. Can be released and pull someone up a staircase; use extra energy to add power to the release and would-be movement. Like the battery of an electric bike as bonus to muscle energy.

Culture of the Starbound


People are often born through ectogenesis and have access to abundant resources and goods. They have used life-extension technology and set off on generation ships to explore new habitable systems, with the goal of preserving trillions of lives.

One of the destinations for the Starbound is the Geis sol system, which has been imagined for untold lifetimes. — When they arrive, they discover the planet Grand Voss, which has already been built upon with enormous megastructures, rings with "engines", and two immense rings supported by Atlas Tethers.

The people of Grand Voss are physically sparse in their daily lives, but new life is born and people may remain in the world forever. Before their arrival, the Starbound sent wafer sats to map the planet and moon of Chione and her dependent moons; the satellites are also sent building probes to begin construction on their new home. The images, recordings, and renderings showed the planet with two immense rings and the Atlas Tethers as secondary habitats.

The Starbound people now on Chione once live on generation ships and have made efforts to preserve their vessels, which are home to trillions of lives. They are en route to the Grand Voss solar system, with its super-Earth and

The Starbound have sent probes to gather resources and have mapped their eventual home with the help of wafer sats. The probes have also started building structures on Grand Voss ahead of their arrival. Chione; our soon-to be home, the super-Earth- has two massive rings with 16 Atlas Tethers each and has been built upon, but there are no signs of biological life.

Life-extension technology has allowed some of the crew to live long enough to tell stories of the Earth they once knew, but only through the shared archives and tales passed down from previous generations. The thought of eventually reaching their new home gives the Starbound hope. The colonists aboard the generationship have been traveling for untold centuries with the dream of reaching Grand Voss and its moon Chione.

They have been imagining the possibilities of establishing settlements on these new worlds, and have built up an abundance of confidence in their technology and abilities. As they approach their destination, many of the passengers feel a mix of excitement, fear, and uncertainty. The Starbound have waited for this moment for so long and are ready to so-finally set foot on a new world, but they also know that they may face challenges and obstacles that they can't yet imagine. Some of the colonists have lived through multiple generations on the ship and see Grand Voss as a new home, a chance to finally put down roots.

Others still feel drawn to the idea of exploring even further out into the Milky Way, never content to stay in one place for long. Regardless of their individual aspirations, all of the passengers on the ship share the thrill of discovery and the sense of wonder at the prospect of encountering an unknown alien civilization and their awe-inspiring engineering feats. They are filled with questions about the purpose of the structures they see in the first images from the probes, and what they might find when they arrive.

As they travel closer to Grand Voss, the passengers reflect on their long journey and the sacrifices they've made along the way. They know that there's no turning back now and that the future is uncertain, but they're excited for what lies ahead. They write in their journey logs about the emotions they're feeling and the hopes they have for their new home, ready to take on whatever challenges they might face when they finally arrive.

The Starbound colonists have finally arrived on Chione, a super-Earth with quadruple moons, one of which is named Grand Voss. They have been traveling for centuries, possibly even millennia, in a generation ship and have high hopes for their new home. The settlers have mined a fictional material called 'icor' for its exceptional building properties and have built structures that scaffold off the atlas tethers to avoid the turmoil of the oceans. Despite the difficulty of building on this new world, the colonists see the structures as a way to enable life on Chione.

However, some people have become complacent and do not fully understand the significance of their new home. The oceans are so deep that if one were to sink, they would be crushed by the density. The structures on Chione are meant to protect and sustain life, but this meaning is not widely understood by the settlers.

The Starbound colonists have named themselves as such because they are now "grounded" after their long journey. The original generation ship is long gone, and the settlers on Chione are working to consolidate their new home.

It seems like you are writing about a colony of people who have traveled to a new world called "Chione" and its four moons, one of which is named "Grand Voss". They have built structures using a fictional material called "icor" for their new home and are seeking to consolidate and build upon it.

However, the oceans on Chione are very deep and dangerous, making it difficult to build on the surface. The colony also has an AI system which they trust to represent their good will and ambitions. The narrator acknowledges that this AI system is more reliable and valuable than any human being because it is not limited by time and death.

The Edict
The player character in the game begins as a robot but later transforms into an Edict, a crystalline and abstract machine species native to Grand Voss. Edicts are capable of adapting their shape and behavior to suit the environment and can build up heat energy that restricts movement. To dissipate heat, they can rest or come into contact with water, although extreme heat can vaporize the water source. The player's Edict form has improved mobility and abilities such as a better rolling jump and the ability to bounce off walls and floors for momentum. The appearance of the Edict form is crystalline, flexible and optimized for the environment. The Edict species is known for helping humans with construction and limiting potential hazards, with a legend that they were once builders without much 	personality.


 	

Of the home we left behind
Humanity made great efforts to renew Earth’s biosphere for generations of life after we’d set ourselves to space. By developing star lifting technologies and reducing the mass and burn rate of our star, we multiplied its life into the trillions of years. Designing planet-spanning megastructures that altered the orbits of any retrofitted body; setting them to keep temperate and well-bound as our home star had mass systematically removed.

to the earth and the history we carry of it, we’ve developed functional governance that forwards preservation efforts and brings the era of earth’s exploitation and subsequent biosphere decimation to an end. What species remain recover, we build more centered, sustainable cities shaped for our lives and the lives of our distant earthling cousins.

unearthing archaeological archives, we’ve restored our parent planet to conditions suited for greater diversity of life and extend our home star for lifetimes past the system’s due date in 5 billion years with earth’s ocean to evaporate and boil in a billion years before that

In this game, the original system is being "muted," causing the night sky to go dark, but stars can still be observed in infrared. While Gies, the planet Grand Voss' white dwarf, remains untouched, stars on Earth are disappearing. The player character is a machine that can morph into different forms to repair and maintain the cityscape of Grand Voss. The game encourages non-centric world design, with the player's input not required to show that the world is alive. Players gain new abilities and parts to interact better with the world, with social mechanics enabling players to help repair structures and machines. When the player obtains all the mechanics, their body morphs, and they no longer need a workbench or sources of water to prevent being disabled. The player can engage with characters who will recognize them differently after the morphing, and the game has strong themes of nature and giving aid to others. The player must manage heat, and if they reach peak temperature, they can be disabled until someone finds and aids them. The game features movement mechanics that shoulder engagement with the dialogue system and variability and skill to avoid the threshold limits.

Grand Voss is a super-Earth with an ocean so dense no probe has ever survived its depths. The waters are high in salinity, and each active support structure, Atlas Tether, is encircled by waterfalls that flow continually in fresh water. A form of inorganic life exists within the spires, named 'dodecs'. These objects take form into rare entities known as 'Edict'. The planet has sixteen Atlas Tethers, incredible towered structures that range in humidity, temperature, and size. Autonomous explorers have discovered several habitats optimal for human life along the northernmost Atlas Tether called Maria.
Each of the planets in Grand Voss's system is encircled by two immense rings and held up by an array of 16 active support structures. The megastructures have offered people an incredible range of habitats to choose from, and the sources of water have remained consistent, clean, and wonderfully abundant. The civilizations of Grand Voss have many means of variable energy storage and access, including Hydroelectric Energy Storage and solid-state batteries.
Chione, the child moon of Grand Voss, is shaped into machinations of mass production. The ACP employs production lines with ranks of war-ready machines, which have been retrofitted for use in local maintenance and repair. The energy needs of this civilization are met by Solar collectors, 'thermal converters', and Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). The pulley battery system is also in use, which exerts the force of the body to convert kinetic energy into potential energy.
Grand Voss has an incredible range of habitats, and the sources of water are consistent, clean, and wonderfully abundant. The civilizations have developed an array of energy storage and access technologies, and the towns are maintained by deliberately simple machines set to routine tasks. Lights are designed to mitigate light pollution. The transportation system includes dirigibles, trolleys, ziplines, lifts, and hot-air balloons. The conveyor transit carries passengers across moderate gaps between towns, using propellers to pull itself along the wind tolerant cables.

Here is a consolidated list of notes:
Earth has designed seed satellites to propagate humanity throughout the Milky Way.
The tiny wafer-sats will reach near the speed of light and carry data, variable propulsion modes, and the ability to maintain and replicate themselves with limited resources. Trillions of these machines are set to amass themselves around neighboring stars.
Each swarm maps the system they occupy and sets to maintain the observed heat and energy conditions of orbiting bodies while siphoning and storing all a star's wasted energy.
Satellites designed to operate in swarms will convert solar and heat energy into electricity then expend energy at a cost to convert that into versatile mass.
Seed satellites are tiny satellites with self-replicating capabilities and an onboard AEI to facilitate construction. They carry all of humanity’s knowledge and the plans to start independent, fully-autonomous colonies across the galaxy.
If uninhabited systems with the prospect of life are discovered, the satellites will send ground-bound landers equipped with DNA and AI designed to educate and raise a colony. All while an offshoot of specialized drones will build the infrastructure to keep them alive and well.
Names appear over characters' heads when they greet you. Floating tags are diagetic UI that can be toggled off on click.
The player has a practical set of symbols to communicate with, such as asking if they have any material X or know where to find it.
There is beautiful, complex machinery that adds aesthetic value to the space it occupies. As the players progress through the game, they gain familiarity with the system and learn how to repair each machine. Characters can also elect to fix it on their own, albeit slower. The player can expedite active work.
Fixing should have minor fail-states (small setback).
They have an abundance of resources and energy, measured in terms of their ability to survive indefinitely between systems in the long run.
In the memories of colonists who have passed through other planets, Earth would stand out less.
The player witnesses humans bounding around in low gravity. They've been given a slow, cumbersome body but 'upgrades are on the way'.
The machine they occupy has operated between owners for centuries now. There is subversion to the player's improved character controller after the main 3-hour introduction.
Mechanics for movement still exist with this revised controller: there are upgrades. The new-bodied player can travel significant distances with the right input and positioning. They can bound off walls and floors with momentum and roll at an accelerating speed.
Some animation ideas include losing a screw and trying to catch it, getting surprised by a machine and losing balance, and trying to loosen a bolt but breaking something.
There is no native life as far as humanity can tell. The world is an endless tundra.
Often, technology includes machines dedicated to making a particular type of item within a range of variations. People can toggle and slide variables for items built by these machines. Ambitious colonists can take a template and design entities on their own within the system's constraints. Many retrofit and upgrade manufactured items as they see fit, and the concept of ownership is far removed from how we see it today.
The frozen sea is a location in the game, and Amphitrite is also mentioned.
Consider the following when designing the game: What do you want the players to feel? How would you describe the experience of playing the game? What makes the game different, really? What are you most proud of about the game you're developing? Why were you motivated to make this game in the first place?
The game is non-combat exploration-based.
The creator wants a world they can always come back to and share with friends, as well as express themselves in.
A website
* In terms of design questions, it's important to consider what the player experience should be like. What emotions and feelings do you want to evoke in the player? How can you create a unique and different game experience that stands out from other games? What are the game's strengths and what are you most proud of in the game's design?
* Another important consideration is the motivation behind making this game. Why do you want to make this game and what inspired you to create it? What do you hope to achieve with this game and what impact do you want it to have on players?
* The game should prioritize non-combat exploration over quests or combat mechanics. It should be a world that players can come back to, share with friends, and express themselves in. Lore about the world should be provided to create a rich and immersive experience.
* In terms of ambitions, having the game fully voiced and with high-quality animations would add to the immersion and polish of the game. It's also important to consider fundraising and marketing strategies such as a mailing list, Kickstarter or Indiegogo campaigns, and redirecting players to purchase the game on platforms like itch.io. A timer on the website before the fundraiser launch could build anticipation and excitement for the game's release.

The game is called Noxii.
Quick sketches of the Noxii and their environment/situation are needed, along with a mood board, references, and some music.
The game has events that take place during single-player that only happen once. The player will cycle through maps and upgrade their character. Something will change when the player figures out how to save people and rescue all 12 Noxii.
The player is part of the Edict population, an inactive population of AEI with no memory of the tower.
There are builder-type Edicts that lack personality. They'll wander around helping humans with construction work, limiting potential hazards, and catching anyone that might fall. (including the player) They interfere in conflict and can often dissuade people from fighting by talking in the same way the player does.
Grand Voss is missing expected structures in the northern hemisphere; notably the thruster and the turbines situated at sea level beneath each atlas tether.
The game will have a harvest moon-like system where the player is given empty space and they're allowed to decorate it. (Pre-built foundation options to choose from)
There is a currency called nitts: in-world time, but the player can also earn currency through odd jobs that require traversal or conversation. They can be a courier for a day.
The game will have a trust/distrust | enmity/empathy system.
Chione is soon to be the player's home.
Interstellar travel is involved in the game, and the formula for it must be found.
When designing the experience, consider how Dungeons and Dragons enables player autonomy within a limited scope. Give the player autonomy but restrict it in a less obvious way than an invisible wall.
Militarian factions have paved the highway to hell. In preparation for an invasion, they settled on the moon. They're a minority after thousands of years of peace.
There is no war in the game. No land to fight over, no shortage of resources, wealth, or wisdom.
The player wakes up standing, held by a pulley system attached to the ceiling. When they move for the first time, the tethers buckle and break. A character runs down the stairs, saying that the machine is awake and getting a hold of Marian.
The player finds charging stations throughout the world. The player can only walk at first, but slowly gains more traversal options over 3 hours or so.
The final station/group gathering results in the structure falling.
The player falls to what seems to be death, but they maintain form and consciousness. They sink for what seems like eternity, as light can't reach that far down.



Here are the main ideas I gathered from your notes for your game "Dodec: Beyond Our Home" along with some potential questions and areas for clarification:

This is a collection of ideas related to a game called Dodec. Some of the ideas are related to world-building, gameplay mechanics, visual design, and story elements. Here are the broad ideas.

World-building:
The game takes place in a world where players find charging stations throughout the world and slowly gain more traversal options over 3 hours or so.
The civilization has fallen, and the player falls off the edge of the civilization and deep into the water.
The game's world-building includes concepts like encapsulating stars with Dyson swarms to minimize energy loss, shielding the sun to prevent radiation from escaping, and building a civilization around the Milky Way's SMBH.
The Atlas Tethers were grown like trees, not built like towers.
The game features a third-person navigation system and emphasizes character development with friendly NPCs instead of lethal enemies.
The game also includes the use of Dodec symbols of language designed to enable greater player expression when interacting with NPCs.
The game uses Unity 2019.3, and the local star rotates around the scene in a sidereal tilt.
There are different color schemes used in the game, such as Cosmic Latte, Cosmic Purple, Cosmic Orange, and Cosmic Blue.

Gameplay mechanics:
The game includes a slow 'amble' relative to normal gameplay, which is a quiet, reflective moment.
The game also features the Build-up and Release mechanism to emulate the build-up and release of Halo's Plasma pistol for the electromagnetic gauntlets.
The game encourages the players to justify their actions to dispel the notion of wrong-doing in their minds.
The game uses symbols before the start of each sentence to help the player 'intuit' meaning over time.
The player can customize their R2-D2 voice for vocal expression, and the lines are representative of expressions made.
The player doesn't deliver packages or food because everything they would need is within walking distance.
NPCs choose their own nodes if the player affects none.
If an NPC runs out of dialogue, they'll find a way to change the direction of the conversation or the position of a node in the dialogue tree.

Visual design:
The game uses the preview's physically based sky and fog scene volumes to work around the floating point limitations of Unity.
The game features Chione Rotation, which is a work in progress.

Story elements:
The game's story features a fallen civilization, and the player falls off the edge of the civilization and deep into the water.
The player maintains form and consciousness despite the impact shattering them like hitting concrete.
The game encourages players to recognize the flaws they've inherited from fallible giants.
The machine of our soul is felt to be ours.

Overall, the game seems to be focused on providing players with an engaging world-building experience that encourages them to explore and interact with friendly NPCs while reflecting on their own actions and justifications. The game's visual design uses different color schemes and incorporates unique elements like Chione Rotation. The game also features original gameplay mechanics like the Build and Release mechanism and slow 'amble' relative to normal gameplay, which adds to the reflective tone of the game.
The following are ideas and concepts related to space exploration, game design, and general discussions:
Space exploration:
Water-bodied planets vary in size and rotational period, and they all have natural satellites.
Debris is not found in the outer solar system.
A Dyson swarm is seen circling a white dwarf, leading to nearby planetary bodies.
The white dwarf is stable for bi.
The gravitational pull of a planet can be calculated using an online tool.
The distance between Sirius A and Sirius B is relevant.
Multi-directional elevators require maintenance.

Game design:
The game is set in a grounded science fiction setting with no hover cars, teleporters, or hyperspace travel, and humans are bound by the laws of physics.
Objectives often involve repairing machines or collecting robots for tasks.
The game encourages players to coordinate goals and look out for sources of water to reduce heat buildup.
The character controller should react to the world around them without prompts, and the camera should rest on the avatar.

Here are some questions that can help us to elaborate on these ideas:
What are some examples of hobbies that are more expressive than others, and how can they contribute to self-development?
How can game designers avoid skinnerbox practices and create a game that can outlast consumer expectations?
How can the GIES sphere be used as a UI element to help players navigate dialogue, and what are some potential limitations?
What are some challenges and benefits of creating a self-supported co-op that emphasizes community and democratic decision-making?
How do markets affect social cohesion, and what are some potential alternatives?
How can time constraints be used to create a more challenging and immersive gaming experience, and what are some potential implications for player agency and immersion?

Here's a summary of the main ideas in the text:
Dodec is a non-combat mystery game about exploration and forming bonds with people. The game is set in the vibrant, vertical city of Grand Voss, where players can uncover secrets and mysteries.
The game's society includes a race of beings called AEI who arrived after humanity and offered technology and scientific knowledge in exchange for raising human offspring grown via ectogenesis. There are three types of AEI: soft, large, multi-armed non-threatening police/EMT units; Real political/philosophical units with representation in the political space; and humanoid machines with an emphasis on communication and empathy.
Dark Matter and Dark Energy are central to the game's world and are described as the smallest particles before 'nothingness' or 'space' and 'matter/energy'. There is a twist in the game where an artificial intelligence controls the machines in a realistically humanoid being. After a DNA test, this person matches the DNA of humans from 200,000 years ago.
Basic human emotions are more like a 'gradient pie-chart', with depression, fear, aversion, joy, aggression, and 'involuntary action' as the base emotions. The game includes a hypothetical chart that suggests that all 'internal' human emotion is driven by a range of these basic emotions.

Noxii is a sci-fi game that revolves around character development and narrative mechanics without any combat in its initial iteration. It takes place on the planet of Chione, where humans used immense tree-like structures known as Atlas Pillars as scaffolding for their civilization. The game's hub has a variety of scenes, levels, windows, and doors. These scenes change based on the time of day, seasons, and rotation of the moon and its parent planet. This creates visual variety such as the northern lights. The game is grounded in hard science-fiction, so there are no teleporters, hover cars, or faster than light travel. The characters in the game often have prosthetic fingers, noses, and toes because of the likelihood of frostbite. The game features a dialogue system where players can engage in natural conversations with multiple characters, with a two-button dialogue input system. The red edge is an infrared view of Earth, with early Earth covered in lichen with a sage/mint green color.
Noxii refers to something else in this game, and the world's origins and properties are unknown to Old Humanity after decades of research and exploration. The gameplay revolves around forming empathy and human connection, and the narrative is designed to leave a lot to the player's imagination. The game's characters can participate in conversations, and there is a "Reader Noxii" who acts as the devil's advocate and often incites conflict. The game takes place in the capital city, Nordis, which was occupied by an opposing military force during the conflict. It is common for Chione residents to have prosthetic fingers, noses, and toes because of the likelihood of frostbite.
That sounds like an interesting and ambitious game concept! It's refreshing to hear that the sci-fi elements are grounded in real-world understanding and that the game focuses on positive themes such as community, renewable energy, and preserving history through oral tradition. The idea of playing as a modular machine that forms ties with people in the community also sounds unique and could lead to some interesting gameplay mechanics. It's also intriguing that the disappearing stars and muted visible spectrum are central mysteries in the game's story. Overall, it sounds like Dodec: Beyond Our Home has the potential to be a thought-provoking and enjoyable sci-fi experience.


Based on the given information, here are the consolidated ideas:
Consider adding a timer to the main menu that counts down until the next pre-made update if early access does well.
Characters should not have independent stories; keep them together.
A potential sequel should focus on dialogue, traversal, and action, but not Mirror's Edge-like running.
Research and consider real-life rehabilitation methods for criminals to inform the game's narrative.
Characters in the game have slightly exaggerated features to make them "characters."
The hub is a former home with the remnants of a bar where all beverages are non-alcoholic. The Noxii need food, bathroom, shower, beds, treadmill, and non-essential items such as books, music, and board games. They also occasionally have access to films, shows, and video games.
The number of twists in a good story is subjective and unpredictable.
The Dodec dialogue system needs a revision to include .wave audio representation, easier visualization of the timeline, and the ability to place expressions along a timeline.
The game controls use LB and RB to chat, LT and RT to traverse, A to run while moving, X to jump while running, and standing still to jump. The hub needs a ladder or pipes to use the traversal system.
The game has no combat, and the focus is on the characters and the player's interactions with them.
The Atlas Pillars and the ring world's origins are unknown to the characters, creating mystery and encouraging players to learn more about the world.
The game focuses on conversational expression, not dialogue choices.
Robots in the game look like "humans" wearing metal armor, and their design hints at their status as machines.
Realistic jobs in the game have payment up front.
Conversations in the game have "active" tangents, with dialogue branching off into different topics and potentially not returning to the previous subject.
The ease of relationship with characters is determined by the severity of their crimes.
Research and reference Indian culture, including medical tourism, street food in Chennai, the number of states and languages, and the prevalence of English as a secondary language.

Here are some general ideas that might enlighten readers about the game's world. Let me know if you have any other questions or need further clarification!
So, based on the conversation between Glitch and Eden, there are several ideas and concepts that are worth highlighting:
Glitch has commissioned a 3D artist to create a glove for a game focused on characters and their interactions. In this game, there is no combat and players must unravel the mystery of the world beyond the character's home. Eden is being asked to provide input on what an "outdoor" scene would look like from the vantage point of an office window that looks towards the crowded streets of a city.
The game's small town-block-like area beyond the window is less populated than the rest of the city, and there are potential titles for the game, such as "Gies: Beyond the City" or "Beyond Gies".
Glitch wants to develop a scenario reference to discourage players from skipping through dialogue. In Remnant, an old man talks the player's ear off and if they skip all his dialogue, they might miss a key detail.
The game has different expansion options, such as a 15-minute polished prototype, a 3-hour final vertical slice, and successive 2-hour expansions that build on the core mechanics and flesh out the story.
Noxii climbs with electromagnetic gloves that can overheat and have limited battery life. If both gloves are lost, the player will "rubber-ball" in a protective suit that they can't control and will land in the HUB. The Noxii will look around in curiosity or glance at how high they are in the climbing idle pose. Staying still on metal surfaces still consumes charge but slower than if they were moving.
There is a scene in the game where someone can't recognize the pattern of the seasons and gets the order of Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall mixed up. The Noxii starts to panic audibly when the charge starts to get low and becomes nervous at half charge, but curious about which direction they're heading near full charge.

Regarding the game's scenario reference, it seems that Glitch wants to make the dialogue meaningful and interesting enough so that players won't skip through it. By having an old man talk the player's ear off and then giving them an item with a special connection to his past, the player is incentivized to pay attention and not miss any details. Additionally, Glitch suggests using traditional text boxes and visualizing tangents, so that players can see how the dialogue relates to different topics and ideas. Finally, Glitch proposes "breaking" tangents or introducing new ones as the dialogue progresses to keep players engaged and interested in what's being spoken about.
Glitch mentioned a dialogue system that is designed to discourage players from skipping through dialogue. In this system, tangents with traditional text boxes are used, where one box fills up, the others fade away. Getting interrupted breaks or removes tangents and introduces new ones. This means that if the player skips through the dialogue, they will miss out on potentially significant information and details that are necessary to progress through the game. By using this system, the player is encouraged to pay attention to the dialogue and engage with the characters and their stories.


From the given text, here are the main ideas that can be consolidated:
The limitations of language and facial expressions make it difficult to convey the full range of human emotions and intent in online communication.

Words and emotes are not enough to convey the complete spectrum of human emotion.
Our facial expressions can often help us to convey our emotions, but subtle expressions require a social context to understand.
Deeper understanding of a person's emotions and intent requires knowing their situational context.

The dialogue system in the game is designed to flow naturally and allow players to take control of the conversation.

There are no traditional dialogue options.
NPCs can interrupt players and introduce tangents.
Players can interrupt NPCs, hold their thoughts, or persist in speaking.
The system is similar to Oxenfree, allowing players to take control of discussions.

The game is set on Chione, an icy and habitable moon, and features an immense artificial ring with built-in engines that spans the equator.

The planet's atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen and oxygen.
Civilization is working to melt the moon's ice to release CO2 trapped within.

The Hearth is a warm and well-lit place in the game where people gather and interact.

It is a cozy-looking room where a thin, spindly man is reading a book, and a short, plain-looking boy is talking to someone outside.
Uniformed men casually step up beside someone and gesture at the door.

The game features situational humor and vertical level design similar to Dark Souls.

Questions to clarify these ideas might include:
Why is it difficult to convey the full range of human emotions in online communication?
How does the dialogue system in the game work, and what makes it unique?
What is the atmosphere of Chione composed of, and why is civilization working to melt the moon's ice?
Who gathers and interacts in The Hearth, and what is its significance in the game?
How does situational humor play a role in the game, and how does it differ from canned jokes?

Here are the main ideas from the text:
The game is set in a tower used as a 'rehabilitation facility'.
The tower has a rusty bunk bed, a gas-lit fireplace, and a plastic shower curtain. The plant life is visible in the warmer seasons, and there are greenhouses on the premises.
The Atlas Tether is used to indicate scene transitions or the passage of time between them.
The Enul Spheres are Seeds that have specific rules and are crucial to the game.
AEI keeps a log of interactions and regularly updates the characters' biographies. Clara can update the characters' photos manually.
After completing the game, three of the characters you talked to return, and the player can choose which ones to use. These characters should live in the same or similar area.
A character who is always present and usually reading acts as a devil's advocate.
No violence or death occur in the game, and there is a compassionate robot voice that players can choose.
Noxii characters will read, draw, sleep, hum, watch movies, and play games together. The player can engage them in conversation, and some activities require the Noxii to step away.
There is a patio past one of the doors where a judge-like guy visits every now and then to review progress.
Situations representative of a character's crimes take place throughout the game.
After graduating all the Noxii, the AEI is left alone with its thoughts for a time. The player's actions determine two things in the end: relationship status of two characters and the philosophical perspective of another. Three characters return, and the player can choose which one to follow.
In a later expansion, Oski's robotic body is destroyed, and she forms an entire arm through sheer force of will. Can the Noxii restore it?
The AEI seed has red tendrils that are used for basic assimilation of technology. There are parts that can be found to give players different forms of mobility. This is the goal of the second game.
Oski can build empty Enul Spheres, which start off dark and don't have an internal AEI.
There are multiple factions within Nordylis, and the Allies or Nordylis faction lost the battle.
A wide variety of cultures are represented in the characters' backgrounds, names, and practices.
A character who is a veteran from the war has frostbite scars and an artificial nose/fingers.
There is a need to write up a contract for concept artists.

Questions that can help clarify the ideas:
What kind of rehabilitation is happening in the tower, and who are the Noxii characters?
How are the Enul Spheres used in the game, and what are their specific rules?
Who is Clara, and what is her role in the game?
How do players choose the three characters that return after completing the game?
What is the role of the devil's advocate character in the game, and how does it affect the player's choices?
What is the purpose of the judge-like guy who visits the tower, and what happens during these visits?
How do the situations representative of a character's crimes affect the game, and how do they affect the player's choices?
What is the goal of the second game, and how does it relate to the AEI seed with red tendrils?
What kind of cultures and practices do the characters have, and how do they affect the game's storyline?
What kind of contract is needed for the concept artists, and what is scope creep?

The game setting seems to be a futuristic world where colonists live in virtual reality capsules while their bodies are kept in stasis. Chione is a civilization that has evolved since the original colonization, and the game features different types of Chione's machines. The following are the topics that need to be consolidated and discussed:
Life, Society, & Culture: This section should explain the culture of the people who live in Chione.
Regional Groups & Politics: This section should discuss influential, local interest or power groups in the area.
Trade, Commerce, & Industry: This section should provide details on what is produced in Chione.
Landscape, Weather, & Ecosystem: This section should give an overview of the land, its appearance, and behavior.
Notable Landmarks: This section should mention some outstanding geographical features found within the civilization.
Describe the routes, trails, and notable locations in this section.
Vertical Slices of Dialogue: This section should showcase different personalities by using vertical-slices of character dialogue.
Virtual Reality Capsules: This section should detail how some colonists spend centuries in accelerated VR while their bodies are kept in stasis.
Chione's Descended Machines: This section should describe different types of Chione's machines, including their behavior in the game.

What can readers expect to learn about Chione's culture in the game?
What are the significant power groups in Chione, and how do they influence the game's story?
What are some of the products produced in Chione, and how do they affect gameplay?
How does the game present the landscape of Chione?
What are some of the most notable landmarks and geographical features in Chione?
What are the routes, trails, and notable locations within Chione?
What do the different characters say that showcases their personalities?
How do colonists live in virtual reality capsules, and how does it affect gameplay?
What are Chione's Descended Machines, and how do they behave in the game?


Let's talk about a sci-fi story that takes place 500,000 years ago, where humanity has reached a technological utopia. Basic income has been established to prevent poverty, space agencies have developed wafer sats to explore the cosmos, renewable energy is abundant, and nanotechnology has revolutionized medical science. However, things start to take a dark turn as the misuse of antibiotics leads to the rise of superbugs that cause a global epidemic. Governments start to collapse, and humanity's last hope for survival is to construct domed cities with artificial wombs to preserve the species. Svalbard is chosen as the primary location for this project, and scientists and technologists from around the world gather there to plan the construction of these cities.
What do you think of this story? Is there anything that you find particularly interesting or engaging? What improvements do you think can be made to make it more compelling?
The above writing is a CYOA (Choose Your Own Adventure) game timeline that narrates a story in which the player wakes up in a deserted city, Freya, only to discover that the place has been evacuated due to an ongoing war. The story follows theplayersr as they try to escape the renlei forces who invade Freya. They try to make their way to Nordis, where they can join forces with the locals and fight back.
However, the story has some gaps, and the player needs to make choices to continue the plot. Below are the remaining chapters that need to be filled in to complete the story:
Chapter 4: Isetefjell
The team reaches Isetefjell and meets with the locals, who are already preparing for a counter-attack against the renlei forces.
The player can choose to join forces with the locals or try to make their way to Nordis alone.
If the player chooses to join forces, they participate in training and preparation for the upcoming battle.
If the player chooses to travel alone, they face various challenges, including navigating through the wilderness and fighting off renlei scouts.

Chapter 5: Dettestedet
The player reaches Dettestedet, which is now a renlei camp, and must infiltrate the place to gather information on their plans.
The player can choose to go in stealthily or try to fight their way through.
If the player chooses to proceed stealthily, they must avoid detection, disable security systems, and gather information without being caught.
If the player chooses to fight their way through, they face various challenges, including taking down guards, avoiding traps, and confronting the renlei leader.

Chapter 6: Aestedr
The player discovers that the renlei forces are using an abandoned city, Aestedr, as a base of operations, and they must infiltrate the place to sabotage their plans.
The player can choose to explore alone or with a team of locals.
If the player works alone, they face various challenges, including avoiding detection, sabotaging equipment, and gathering intel.
If the player joins with a team, they participate in a coordinated attack, taking down guards, destroying machinery, and sabotaging the renlei's plans.

Chapter 7: Final Battle
The player and their team make their way to Nordis, where they join forces with the locals to launch a final assault against the renlei forces.
The player can choose to participate in the battle or try to find another way to end the conflict.
If the player chooses to fight, they face a tough battle, including taking down renlei machines, confronting renlei soldiers, and trying to disable their base.
If the player chooses to find another way, they must find a way to negotiate a peace treaty or sabotage the renlei forces from within, ultimately ending the conflict.
By filling in these gaps, the story will have a clear and strong plotline. In addition, the player will have the agency to make choices that determine the outcome of the game

OSKIDERE - SENTINEL MACHINE
==============================================================================

Profile:
Oskidere is a modular machine, originally designed for war but repurposed for 
utility and repair. As a Sentinel, Oskidere's primary function is to maintain 
the infrastructure of Maria and assist its citizens. Despite its imposing size 
and weight, Oskidere has become beloved by many for its selfless service.

Background:
Created during a time of conflict, Oskidere was part of a line of war machines 
designed to defend human interests. When peace was established, instead of being 
decommissioned, Oskidere and others like it were repurposed to serve the 
colonies on Chione. Over centuries, Oskidere has operated under various owners, 
slowly developing a sense of identity and purpose beyond its original 
programming.

Role in the Conflict:
As tensions rise between the citizens of Maria and the ACP on Boreas, Oskidere 
finds itself in a unique position. Its knowledge of Maria's infrastructure and 
ability to repair complex systems make it invaluable in maintaining the colony's 
independence. However, its origins as a war machine complicate its relationship 
with both sides of the conflict.

Abilities:
- Modular design allows for adaptation to various tasks
- Bipedal and wheeled locomotion
- Advanced repair and maintenance capabilities
- Heat management system (requires periodic cooling)
- Ability to interact with and form bonds with human colonists

Personality:
Despite its mechanical nature, Oskidere has developed a distinct personality 
through its interactions with the people of Maria. It is known for its 
dedication to service, curiosity about the world around it, and desire to form 
meaningful connections with others. Oskidere struggles with the weight of its 
wartime origins and seeks to prove its worth as a protector and builder rather 
than a destroyer.

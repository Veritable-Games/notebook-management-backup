Let's do it.
That was fun.
Let's do that again some time.
Hostiles down.
Never saw it coming.
Moving to your mark.
Moving into position.
We should do that more often.
Check, ready for assault.
Ready to engage.
Expecting company, 38?
Yes, sir. Though there's no sport in such a weapon.
I was just getting warmed up, sir.
Over so soon?
Hold on sir! Let me kill these scumbags first.
Boss! Hold onto your guts while I rip out theirs.
I thought you were tougher than that, sir.
We ain't got time to bleed, sir.
Good kill.
Enemy down.
Nice takedown.
One more down.
That's a kill.
Another kill for the cause.
Hostile down.
Assisting delta 40.
Fixers in need, I'm on it.
Hold on fixer, help's on the way.
Lending a hand to 62.
I'm on Scorch! 
Squad leader receiving help.
It's dead, good.
That's one for me.
That one's out of its misery.
Dead. Stay down.
This one's still moving, I hate it when they do that.
Fixer's out!
40's down!
We've lost scorch!
62 is incapacitated!
Take out that droid!
Lousy clanker.
These bugs are tough!
Are all geonasians this tough?
They'll pay for that.
We'll get 'em back.
We'll have your lizard hide for that!
I can't believe he fell for that.
I hate those things.
Beautiful strike, sir.
Couldn't have done it better myself, sir.
I'll take your lead, sir.
Nice clean hit, sir.
Nothing like a little bacta.
Bacta applied.
Much better.
07, ready for combat.
07, good to go.
I feel better now.
I'm ready to go, delta squad.
That helped.
I needed that.
That's just what I needed.
Nice and simple.
Take that!
One down, millions to go.
That's a kill.
Droid scrapped.
Droid erraticated.
Yeah, got him!
Down and out.
The only good droid, is a dead droid.
Delta leader, please return to squad.
Squad lead, we're back here.
Sir, we're waiting.
38, is something the matter?
Awaiting your orders, 38.
Should we wait for you to catch up, sir?
Have you lost your way, sir?
Sir, could you lend us a hand up here?
You're missing the fight, sir!
Another stop? Not again, sir.
38's gone mad!
Squad leader's firing on us!
Hostile commando!
Something wrong sir? You're not moving.
Taking a break, 38?
Are you tired, squad leader?
Shouldn't we be moving along, sir?
Is your helmet too tight, sir?
Squad leader, are you ok?
Battle fatigued, sir?
Did you see something? 
What are you shooting at?
I don't see any targets here, sir.
What is that!?
Don't stop!
We're almost through!
We're in trouble, sir.
Sorry lead, no can do.
With all due respect, sir. That's impossible.
I'd like to do that, sir. But I can't.
Negative delta leader.
No can do, sir.
No way squad leader.
I'm tapped out. (out of ammo)
Ah, fresh ammo.
07, ready for duty.
Thanks for the help, delta.
Get the fuck off!
Droidekas on my viewer, deltas!
Watch it, drones!
On your toes, delta!
Drones ahead!
Drones incoming!
Got a lock on some bugs.
We got trouble.
This could get ugly.
We've got problems, deltas.
There goes squad leader.
Lead down!
Do that again, 38, and I'll kill you myself.
Sir, you're a waste of good genes.
Somebody radio command and get us a replacement for 38.
They're making me angry, sir.
What's the point, sir?
Your leadership fails to inpsire, sir.
There he goes again.
Let's send 38 back to basic training.
Kill the enemy, sir, not yourself.
Sir, stand aside.
Outta my way.
Sir, you're inturrupting my killing spree!
I could do this all day!
Keep 'em coming!
They're just lining up to die!
This wouldn't take so long if you could aim!
Try aiming instead of talking!
My trigger finger is getting itchy. When do I get to kill something again?
Come out come out, so I can kill you all.
38, contact command and ask them when I get to kill something.
Maintaining muscle dicipline.
Taking cover!
With extreme pleasure, sir.
Let me show you real marksmanship.
They don't stand a chance against me.
That one should've played dead. Now it's extra dead.
And stay down.
38, you sure you don't want someone who can shoot straight? (inform player of poor squad member choice for specific task)
You want to rely on his sniping?
Need meds...not...doing...well.
Need meds, now!
I'm hit...
Administering bacta.
I can't hold 'em!
I'm pinned down!
I can't move!
That's one less droid.
Multiple enemies, incoming!
Clankers!
Bolt bags ahead!
Let's get outta here!
Back it up, team!
Move it back!
I gotta get outta here.
Move it or lose it.
Can't take any more.
Enough of this.
We've gotta pull out, damn.
Hey watch it!
Don't make me take you out, sir.
Stop it already!
I've got enough problems.
Are you trying to get me angry, sir?
Bang bang.
That's what you get for messing with
Another dead enemy.
Dead, good riddance.
Die screaming!
Die!
Executed.
Annihilated!
You're dead.
Clean shot.
I love that metallic sound when they die.
Meet the maker, droid.
One more for the slag heap.
Droid terminated.
Mech unit eliminated.
The boss is down, I repeat. The boss is down!
Man down!
There goes a delta.
There goes a teammate.
Lost a squadmate.
Let's get going.
Be right back.
I'm good to go.
I'm ready for battle.
Much better now.
Delta 7, ready for combat.
Set for combat.
That did the trick.
Feeling alright now.
You got it.
Consider it done.
Heard ya, sir.
I hear ya.
Check.
Battle damage over here.
8, nice arm there.
Way to take 'em down.
Busted another, boss.
You got one, 38.
Yeah, take that!
Way to blast them!
Nice kill!
You've got to be kidding.
I need backup!

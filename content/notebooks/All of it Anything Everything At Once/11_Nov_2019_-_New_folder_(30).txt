Carefully tuned, spring-loaded camera for the player character, and reacts to move it very subtly.

====== REC003.txt ======
Could you emulate the system from journey in terms of quantities of fish and how
performance easy is to run and translate that into, well, leaves that react to wind?
You have, like, maybe the leaf in the middle, react physically and then if it does, react physically then...
Hmm...
You...
What do we worth to have physics-based objects like leaves in the game if they're
performant, how do you make them performant?


====== REC004.txt ======
it's the detail that matters. Be attention to detail. And I feel like we'll use an urban
environment you can interact with, be really interesting. And when we can do walls and
break, what can we do at least?


====== REC005.txt ======
Imagine you're walking around the facility, or not, jeez.


====== REC006.txt ======
your tree. And as you pass by it, the wind beneath your feet carries the leaf
supports. You move back and forth again, you know, kind of plan around with them.
Eventually fun, you can use your hands, kind of wave back and forth.
Hmm. The idea is ideas
Um

one of the overlook factors of ages, the smoothing of the teeth, the ridges, you're
getting your second pair, so they were down.


====== REC010.txt ======
So why replace your teeth if they're still functional?
And I had to imagine that teeth are the one of the biggest indicators of age in this world.
Smoother they are, the older they are.
And some have a lot of false teeth but it's not noticeable.
But I've, yeah smooth teeth and jagged teeth.
Jagged teeth being indicated, it's very, very subtle to get it for being younger.
Bellow hundreds. If, as I were, bellow 70s. I'm not sure how long it lasts. Typically on average.
Anyway.

Bionic super cat. They can leap across buildings. Dodge obstacles and navigate the heights
that normal cats can't ever to aspire.
Okay, idiot movie reference.
Huh?
Sounds like every other 80s movie.
No, but he's not actually a good deal though. That's an awesome reference.
Yeah, maybe there's a black one. Black kitty. Let's go do it with the green eyes.
Green yellow eyes.
You know I'm almost fucking bad.
You should've saw those.
Oh, I wouldn't find room.
Maybe this is laying there.
Oh, I'm actually fucking bad.
And I'm just like, the fuck you do in my room?
Okay.
Please listen to this remark right now.
What would be the antithesis that could really be called?
The antithesis.
The antithesis.
I don't know why.
The antithesis is the opposite.
The adjacent.
The potential we have saying opposite.
Oh, no, it would be something that would be considered the light lord.
Hmm.
Not quite the case.
Okay, so the two are weird.
He's there.
No, no, he's there.
The cosmic entity.
The cosmic horror.
Yeah.
He's not the lord.
He's the prosperer.
The propagator.
That would be the shaperone of...
Yet.
Whatever it is.
Whatever it fucking is.
What is that?
What is that?
What is that entity?
What is that?
What is that entity?
What is that?
Oh, well, okay.
Well, I'm an idiot.
Actually, it's nothing.
Because that's human behavior.
There's no opposite.
That's how they make gods.
That's how they make a light lord.
I don't know that they see the evil.
They're like, oh, there has to be an opposite to the evil.
That's to be good too, right?
That's to be good too.
The evil light in the house has the evil...
What do you think a light lord is, Chris?
The fuck do you think a light lord is a god?
No, they're literally thinking humanity.
They're looking to the range.
Like, this is the good thing.
This is the positive gods.
These are the gods.
And if something is wrong, oh no.
We've, we've, we've, we've, uh,
angered the positive gods and made, or made the bad gods anger here.
Because we're stupid.
Humans, humans, humans, humans.
Humans is a bad, bad at making...
Oh, hey.
Have you heard of it?
Every day.
Every day.
Jesus Christ,可 shit up.


====== REC012.txt ======
Okay, I do have to do it too, I hate to ramble on, um, I don't know, I do it, I do it, but I'm sober, so...
Fair enough. I'm not annoyed. Okay, let's see, I don't know what else. Um, what was that?
Damn it, I'm trying to explain something, I forgot. Are you going to hate this song? No,
Hey, could you got a car crash? Do I?
I think this is probably the pantry this time.
Oh, you know what? Hi, it doesn't work, we're here at home, and it's day. I can't say this, I'm going to use this.
For this reference, it's pretty funny this guy here, what is he trying to say?
What? You can use it from there. It's dangerous, it's ransom. Yeah.
Yeah, but they're not going to be the exact thing I hate. Huh? They're not going to be the exact thing I hate.
No, no, not like a loud knife, it's like a hit the chill.
In the pantry? Easily chill, yeah. Just as long as not bad, not bad, just like that.
The exact thing I hate all over me.
That said, they are pretty loud doing the day, so I don't think I was hearing.
No, so it's not...

So another example to my soul, but for Kutulu, Kutulu builds up stress.
Kutulu builds up anxiety, and the anxiety is either disperse through play, or disperse
through a version of anxiety built up in the human sense.
He needs to step away.
This is too much.
He can't handle it.
He can't handle all the betting and the loving.
But that's okay.
He needs his space.
So you've got to understand the level of anxiety that your little buddy goes through.
And how he kills comfortable.
And he'll come to you in time.
Anyway, hypothetically.
Well, for Hollian, most hypothetically, theoretically.
Okay, so there's an anxiety fear.
Now there's an anxiety built up, and it's expressed as, well, anxiety, fear, or aggression.
An anxiety exists as a thing in organisms, and also he just says as a, as a, a separate behavior.
Or a described behavior, a categorized behavior.
It's really a, a greedy entry, right?
But these symbols of language are inadequate to describe the radius.
The radius is anxiety leads to extreme anxiety, fear, or aggression.

Study game play loops. Look at the games you finished. I'm trying to understand why they were so successful.
How did Mirror Edge? Mirror Edge can't be coming back. What was the loop?
How did I know what's gonna be coming back? Oh, what was the loop? And I think I know what the loop is there.
It's a matter of understanding the mechanics.
The dynamics, the aesthetics, the narratives, the pits and pieces that make up the game.
And we are articulating them into the core, not the loops, the procession of plants.
The elliptical orbits of gameplay loops.


====== REC018.txt ======
the elliptical orbits of game loops, multiple game systems coming together to form the feeling of a game, the pacing in a loop that is none specific to
better non-specific to each other, I can mentor Vania, I need to take this better on just having fun to get him out of the groove


====== REC019.txt ======
Gameplay grooves to fall into, a sense of rhythm, a sense of pace, a well-designed game
and its levels are like an intricate ballet of mechanics, narrative and the wonderful
array of interplaying systems that build a game and its experience.


====== REC020.txt ======
Gameplay loops, no. Gameplay grooves. Don't have to be.


====== REC021.txt ======
Fun. Old school gel, which he's turned a lot of people off because they're called loops
that being individual turns of a combat encounter are usually pretty boring. However, die hard
fans of RPGs love them because they play some massive emphasis on high level, meta gameplay
loops. We get to see your characters and the story evolve over the tens of hours. This
whole gameplay loops are just steps that will savage your goal by offering up plop.
Do the steps have to be tedious? I'm sorry, but that's okay, it's too mean. Steps don't
have to be tedious, they can be interesting. The steps don't have to be boring, the steps
don't have to be, how do you be nice to write that? Do I have to be blame? You have to be
blame for once. I have to kind of offend people a little bit, just a little bit. Hey,
JRPGs are kind of boring. I love the narrative of the characters, but I hate their
game play. If I could get the gameplay, I'd be able to be totally happy. Sorry, not sorry.

I just know you know my heart's aching
Loved I've organized my face
As we, sons and sisters
Seasons have shown how your providence takes change
Oh, my life till I shut off
Bruce, by the moon's battle
Left, stick, and I don't replace
Garing a form lifted
Massage a door to physics
In minutes, I leave evidence to your answer
Open forced marriage
And I'll be right back,
I'll be right back,
I'll be right back,
I'll be right back,
I'll be right back,
I'll be right back,
I'll be right back,
I'll be right back,
I'll be right back,
I'll be right back,
I'll be right back,
I'll be right back,
I'll be right back,
I'll be right back,

I'll be right back,
Long, tall, silly goose, why did you hide behind governance of shame?
Smooth and splendid abuse, won't you tell me how to deal with my ego?
Sworn by thorns of foe, I'll bow and call the sheep away from forever in your kiss.
Long, tall, silly goose, why did you hide behind governance of shame?
Long, tall, silly goose, why did you hide behind governance of shame?

I am on my own safe for the close friends.
I taught this game about my teaching about this game.
I am on my own safe for the close friends.

Так можно.
Так, можно.

and it's not sure that the Earth's not sure that game is for the Earth's first.
I could try to put it, it's finding a collective thing,
because that one's both fries.
So I forgot the,
it's me, the Earth's myself,
of course.

There are three branches of development in this game.
There you have the overall lore,
you have the character interactions,
and you have the levels in and of themselves,
acting as a metrophilia like Labyrinth for a minimum of three hours at first,
with this prototype.
It builds up into more content as the game develops new areas,
new sections of the maps that slowly unlock for time-imagined.
I'll have to try it out.
I'll have to try it out of the map.
It's like a baseball plane.
I have a little, a little more erratic.
I've got it, I know it's your next.
I'm good to go.

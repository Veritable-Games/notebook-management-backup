====== REC002.txt ======
Put the first public release on H.H.H. and I know it's at everyone on Discord at everyone's
U.S.Paringly and this one is important.


====== REC003.txt ======
The kickster would exist to expand the game that exists right now on InstaLow.
I'd probably could build it.
I don't need a lot of money.
Just enough to give me advice.
Maybe like, I'll just draw $5.
But about $7, $10, $15.
And eventually you'll build value and you'll increase the burst of the game.
They'll be buying it at the cheaper it is.


====== REC004.txt ======
The end goal will never be a six-shell or triple-acquodal game.
Dense.
And crafted, lovely and crafted levels.
Built in a meant for it rainy away.


====== REC005.txt ======
I need to pitch the game someone that's still there.
Now I need to write a pitch.
I need a pitching Frederick.
And then I need to...
get it in perfect.
Shhh!


====== REC006.txt ======
In the place where character models specialize in the game, I use the Ninja models pre-fab because it's easy to pose.
You can use the normal character controller as is, that's fine.
But I think you need to establish a timeline of days.
Three days.
Twelve.


====== REC007.txt ======
to make it interesting keep all the
like.


====== REC008.txt ======
Okay, so imagine you have the mannequins in the scene, and you have a loop, a perch
and a quadward, you have a day, and a character's animate as they will, this is just a...
because of how the animation is just mess, so no, just, no, because of how the, um,
the time and day limitations that we can't do real-time movement, so there's day one, day two, day three,
or, they're not exactly days, they're rotation periods, because the day is one of those sections,
it's 24 hours, it's 40 hours, it's 72 hours, it takes you along, but it's not very realistic,
you can actually change the brightness, it's not necessarily that hard, they have breaks and it's
a change, the overall rotation is on, but you have to be careful about that, you have to be
find an inefficient way to hide it, put the player in dream mode, and load mode, okay?


====== REC009.txt ======
I don't want to do this, and the locks from where I'm going to have
paws.
Be it a dreamscape in the middle of the day.
Right here.


====== REC010.txt ======
Dragon and Dragons. They're not the same one.
All these pieces of animation are tied to one system.
They're out of force.
That sounds just don't interrupt.
The time when that's been made for this.
So this is their tracks, they're nails, they're uppusses,
all the players in the world are all around.
But they're really cool.
The one player that interacts with anyone, wherever it is.
There it is, I'll never disassemble it.
I don't know, I'll figure it out.
First player.
One with the story of the time.
One with the other with the whole time during itself.
No, four player max.
Keep their own together.
Encouraging or sitting together.
And around characters.
And they know that one.
Yeah, that way it's not so confusing.
We get to 12 now.
Six.
Characters.
Five.
Six.


====== REC011.txt ======
So you and five of the players in this lunch game, you can explore together.
There's a timeline for the NPCs.
I can relax for five minutes. It's easy here.
Five of the players are gonna run down, right? What's night?


====== REC012.txt ======
I can't work on the audio, get them, get them, get them, get the audio, audio, audio
I'm working in a place that needs to be established a world-wide, water-full volume that's always coming
but it's very common, it's very soft because it's very far away from very good pressure


====== REC013.txt ======
form it first, simple figure, biped, can walk. I eventually they'll be able to run and
then climb and leap and navigate the world and eventually they don't lock other means
in navigation. The moment they hit the water, the first time a large pool of water, the
big tentage round in, they sink, it gets dark, pressure starts to build, and the
dotac it heats up and becomes waterborne and you hold your normal running button, which
would be R2, in this case, and you prepare yourself for it really fast across the water.


====== REC014.txt ======
So, I've got a little more told you about this.
Go ahead side with the gold too, and figure out what player to do together.
Now that I have established that glove as possible, thank you to Ops. God damn it, it was awesome.


====== REC015.txt ======
I've got to stop scared tomorrow.
Imagine.
Imagine a crystal in the structure, but it's more of a
unending as it first do.
Like a
surface with a lot of holes.
The molecules, the shapes, and the shapes are
the body, really.
They might be the body, but they were
interesting shape.
It's not human, but it's
beautiful, right?
It's a wonderful shape.
It's wonderful for four.
It's triangular, but not bad.
It's such an easily notion.
Look at that trend.
It's as arbitrary as everything else.
It's good for generalizing.


====== REC016.txt ======
How can I add physics to the IK on that character model?
Do I just choose physics on there?
So, physical bodies.
I like to want to spring.
Here's the character jumps up and grabs something.
The character's kind of wobble and feels the movement.
They can see more physical because they more, they see more tactile.
I need to combine those controllers.
Oh, it's funny.

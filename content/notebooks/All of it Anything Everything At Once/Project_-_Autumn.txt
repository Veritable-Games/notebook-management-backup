Some ideation on the Leafs as Health Mechanic
	* The player has leaves in orbit around them; affected by wind and movement direction
	* The leafs represent health in a less than precise way to afford us greater control  in player expectations for the game; that last bit of health should count as more (ref)
	* failstates make the player lose leaves; they can be collected again by running over them on the ground; detail towards it, the wind picks them back up and returns them
	* if leafs settle on the ground for long enough, they’ll be absorbed by nature in an effect
	* the player can gather more leaves through traversal or being rewarded by characters

	 paths to people's hearts, 
	
	There are mechanical incentives to her staying at home: reading, resting: seeing good time to find renewal in her heart after giving so much. 
	
	. We would have social & restorative mechanics to her staying for her own benefit. 
	There are ways to make this fun for the player: 'tension' using the relational mechanics. The player might see it boring, but her well-being is systemically dependent on good communication with characters. 
	
	
	(Autumn) Reading and listening to herself opens up new doors for character conversations. You are ordained to care of the Ether by expectations of your fabled parents: these guardians would suppose your best-potential in life. All the player's will is transposed into her and what she owes the forest and it's inhabitants. 
      
	* Try not to deify the main characters or make them more important than they are. The expectations are great but perhaps Mother Nature and Father Fortune are made to be abstract idols that people talk of. Not explicit people in their lives. People have great difficulty giving themselves away. We no longer work for ourselves. How can you paint the ideals of a better world without having the game be too far removed from the real world? The sister seasons have inherited great expectations. People will often live for themselves. This does not mean you ought to live for you. My own thing, my own way, this makes up so many of the problems of our lives.
      
	* We are better able to explore the themes if the characters have inherent expectations of what they are to be to the world. 
      
	* You are Autumn borne of the sister seasons. Set as caretaker of your hearth of the world by your parents, Mother Nature & Father Fortune. 
      
	* You are to learn how to attend to the needs of everyone in your village: see that you are borne to a certain responsibility in giving to them. 
      
	* The game is meant to explore the balance of our interpersonal lives. If we see good theming in the writing: Autumn's three sisters- Winter, Spring, Summer are given to these same expectations by the world.
      
	* They have resolved to do this differently. Are doing it by their own model: each set to their own course in accepting the responsibility that has been so dearly ascribed: expressed in faith by their parents. 
      
	* (I'm still thinking on how we'd convey 'what the people need' from the sister seasons / and their immensely-tall guardians? Why can she give this thing and not anyone else: why is there any exclusive power?)
      
	* We might have to ideate on the direction. But to set the stage. You have been endowed this responsibility as Autumn for a long time, catering to everyone's needs. It is easy to do what they ask. It is easy to see that people are taken care of in a day. It would be unfair if they did not have your abilities to see them through the season, would it not?
      
	* The sister seasons: Winter you would meet first. Our modern cynic. Probably the most relatable character to our general audience. She might be idealized at first, seen as someone to look up to. Does what society asks of her and then sees to her own will for the season. People may have some regard for her. See her utility. Respect her, even demonstrate some semblance of care for her. But they are not so given to community with this person, Winter. She has never seen reason to clasp an outstretched hand; no matter her needs, she resolves "I am alone in this", or scoffs at the attention. "I am fine, you are a bother." Autumn may spend time getting to know her, then find the heart of her ills. She may learn against this practice by how lost Winter seems. 
      
	* Spring gives in abundance. Gives everything she may. To an incredible detriment to others. Players may see joy in this. We would want to be there to support her: the community sees as much value in her. She is kind, she is caring; but Spring, Spring does not know how to ask for herself. May give beyond what she is capable of giving: at a loss to herself and her well-being. It would take moments of conversation and insight to her experiences to understand why she does what she does. People may take advantage. Autumn must be a the older sister. Summer is interesting. She is outwardly joyous. Pleasant, warm: smiles deeply and sincerely. Talks to people with a strange, almost plastered bliss as if she lives for these responsibilities to her village. The second oldest of the four seasons. She is in a strange solitude in this thing. How does Autumn differ? Is it right of her to say?
      
	* Father Fortune has to be hardened in his ideals. 'work is our merit, labor is our value' we would not see purpose without it, he says. 
      
	* A sharp contrast to Mother Nature. 'People are our home, people are our hearth' if we would give to the world then they would return to us. 
      
	* Winter has given herself self-ascribed importance. Does not see any relational worth in building relationships with the people in her village. Sees to her responsibilities and then returns to her own time. Where is the flaw in this? She is lost on her own. Does not see any good expression at home. Often has destructive habits we would need to abstract for the audience so that they can project a bit. 
      
	* Spring sees great value in people but does not recognize her own worth. People may take more than they ought. She may give more than she is able. If Spring is our idealized giver, she is being taken advantage of. Autumn will not so quickly recognize this shortcoming. Summer is difficult. This one is so good, so sincere about her given purpose that she does not falter in it. Like Mother Nature. She will afford the people of her hearth everything they would require. Do it with a 'strongly convincing' smile that puts people at ease. A resting reassurance in her voice that lets people know they will be okay. This is a strange facade. Autumn will have to try exceptionally hard to get past the barrier to deeper conversations with her. Summer is 'always busy' and does not have 'extra time' for her sister when Autumn would push on these related concerns. Summer is deeply depressed but she would not so admit this to anyone. 
      
	  Some AI Writing: 
      
	* Summer: Summer is the lifeblood of her village, always ready to lend a helping hand to anyone in need. Her sincerity and warmth are contagious, and she exudes an air of unwavering confidence and positivity that inspires those around her. But beneath her cheerful exterior lies a deep sense of loneliness and exhaustion, as she struggles to keep up with the demands of her role. How can Autumn reach out to her sister and offer her the support she needs?
      
	* Spring: The embodiment of generosity and kindness, always putting others before herself. She has a boundless well of love to offer, but often forgets to save some for herself. Autumn may see her as an idealized giver, but people may take more than they ought, leaving Spring with little energy to care for herself. Can Autumn help Spring find a balance between giving and receiving?
      
	* Winter: A loner, content with her responsibilities but lost in her own world. She sees no value in building relationships with the people in her village and has destructive habits that she keeps hidden from others. Autumn must work to understand her sister's struggles and help her find her way back to the community that needs her.
      
	* Mother Nature: The nurturing force that holds the world of Ether together. She sees people as the heart and soul of everything, and her love for them is boundless. But her deep empathy can also make her vulnerable to the pain and suffering of others, and she carries the weight of the world on her shoulders. How can Autumn support her mother and remind her that she too needs care and rest?
      
	* Father Fortune: Believes in the power of hard work and the value of labor. He sees purpose in every task, no matter how small, and holds himself and others to a high standard of productivity. But his rigid ideals can make it difficult for him to connect with others on an emotional level, and he may struggle to see the importance of rest and relaxation. How can Autumn help her father find a balance between work and play, and encourage him to connect with others on a deeper level?
      
	  Some added details and revisions
      
	* Regarding Winter, we can certainly retain her character traits, including her tendency to be distant and self-isolating. However, we can also explore her inner conflict and how her selfishness may be a response to feelings of inadequacy or a desire for control. Instead of portraying her as idealized, we can focus on how she struggles with opening up to her friends and receiving their support, and how this struggle may reflect a deeper fear of vulnerability or a need for emotional connection.
      
	* As for Spring, we can preserve her optimism and positivity, but also emphasize her idealism and tendency to romanticize the world around her. This can give rise to her struggle with accepting the darker aspects of life, such as injustice, suffering, and imperfection, and how she must navigate these challenges without losing her faith in a better future.
      
	* Summer's character can be defined by her competence and efficiency, but we can also depict her struggles with empathy and vulnerability, and how she must learn to balance her desire for excellence and productivity with her need for connection and community.
      
	* Regarding the central narrative, the forces of nature and fate can be viewed as external representations of the inner conflicts and challenges faced by each of the characters. Nature could represent the interconnectedness and interdependence of all living things, while fate could represent the impermanence and unpredictability of life. These forces would manifest in the story as external obstacles that the characters must overcome, such as natural disasters or unexpected twists of fate, and how they must work together to face these challenges with empathy, mutual support, and a commitment to the greater ideals of giving and receiving.

A quick outline of the hero's journey for Autumn: is not substantive yet, but a good start:

1. Call to Adventure: Autumn, being the most empathetic of the sisters, notices a shift in the emotional state of the creatures of Ether, and feels a strong sense of responsibility to fix it. She receives a call to embark on a journey to find the source of the problem and restore balance to Ether.

2. Supernatural Aid: Autumn receives supernatural aid in the form of a magical amulet that helps her to understand the emotions and needs of the creatures she encounters on her journey.

3. Crossing the Threshold: Autumn crosses the threshold into the world of Ether, leaving behind the safety and familiarity of her home.

4. Tests, Allies, and Enemies: Autumn encounters her sisters along the way, each struggling with their own challenges and responsibilities. They become her allies in her quest, but they also face tests and challenges that force them to grow and change.

5. Approach: Autumn and her sisters face a series of challenges that test their individual abilities and force them to work together in new and creative ways. They also encounter enemies who seek to undermine their progress and threaten the balance of nature in Ether.

6. Ordeal: The sisters face a final, climactic battle with the forces of evil that have emerged in Ether. They use their unique abilities to overcome the obstacles in their path and save the world.
﻿
7. Reward: Autumn and her sisters are rewarded for their efforts, both in the form of external recognition and personal growth. They have each learned valuable lessons about themselves and their place in the world.
﻿
8. The Road Back: Autumn and her sisters return to the ordinary world, bringing with them the lessons and experiences they have gained on their journey. They also return as changed people, having experienced a transformation or a coming of age.
﻿
9. Resurrection: Autumn and her sisters face a final challenge as they integrate their newfound knowledge and wisdom into their everyday lives. They must resist the temptation to fall back into old habits and patterns of behavior, and instead use their experiences to continue growing and evolving.

Note that each model is independent but the community would be ‘interdependent’; they have items in life to resolve and so-too things to amend between people. Imperfect valuation- not so innocent weights and biases; these same but far-lessened selfish aspects will still arise in them if we are to build genuine people in the characters.  

Autumn is a time of change, a time to reflect on what has passed and prepare for what is to come. 

To the broad gameplay loop.  If the events which drive characters to help one another are ‘done’ by Mother Nature and Father Fortune. The player will have to contest with their outcomes, no one would decry them for bad events. There is a strange knowledge of these things not being directly action by those ‘higher beings’ you would not commune with them. But Autumn and the Sister Seasons are given direction by them.

In this world of Autumn, the characters are brought to life through the Enacts system. This system allows for meaningful interactions between characters, where dialogue and expression are used to convey their feelings and thoughts. 

Autumn is not a singular story, but rather a collection of tales that revolve around its characters. Each character has their own unique personality and background, and it is through their interactions with one another that their stories unfold. 

As the player inhabits the character of Autumn, they are not the center of the story but rather a part of the larger narrative. The player is free to explore this world, to learn about its inhabitants and their stories, and to engage with them through the Enacts system. By listening and responding to the characters, the player can help to solve any interpersonal issues that may arise and forge deeper connections with them. Through the stories we tell in Autumn, we hope to express our greatest humanity. We hope to teach others about the importance of empathy, of listening and responding to others, and of finding one's own place in the world. With the Enacts system, we can weave these lessons into the very fabric of the game, creating an experience that is truly unique and unforgettable. 

Winter is stoic, reserved.
Spring is more lively and energetic. 
Summer is warm in abundance. 

Autumn, the titular character, is curious and an adventurous spirit, always seeking new experiences and connections with others. 

Through the use of the enact system, players are able to engage in dialogue and interactions with these characters, learning more about their individual stories and helping them navigate their own personal struggles. The changing seasons themselves also play a role in the game's narrative, as the world shifts and transforms with each passing season, presenting new challenges and opportunities for the characters and players alike.

Summer is associated with warmth, growth, and abundance. In the game world of Autumn, Summer could represent a period of flourishing, both in terms of nature and the characters themselves. Summer could be a time of discovery, exploration, and adventure, as well as a time of joy and celebration. 

We have to think on abstract negatives for each of the characters in terms of human relation. So see the positive aspects in each of the characters, glorify the ways they can help people despite these flaws. We need to imagine a mechanic that would incentivize them so wholly to stay at home and rest.

I need to transpose these characters into a story. Keep mind that Mother Nature and Father Fortune are inherently 'good' almost deified characters but they too would have so many affects of disrelation. Maybe in different consequence than that of their children; Winter, Spring, Summer, & Autumn.

Reservation to the self or being stoic as Winter is- this is not a bad thing; so as long as we would have some function to others. Outwardness of the self in way of Spring is not a bad thing- so is it good, but if one would give out all there is to give- the self would go deprived. If Summer is Warm in abundance. Maybe she's figured it out? But she may not so still ask of people- even if all her world's needs are met- time to the self goes on with other things that give them no resolve or heart to way of life outside still. These are my most relational issues. I have no will of life but I can so put myself to work on good things. I am not of to take of others, says Summer, but you are- Autumn would reply. She would not know how to return- they so have tried to give but she can only deflect in sincerity to their worries- reassurance in a smile that does not falter. If pain can be hidden in joy that Summer would be this abstraction. What would Autumn represent then?

We need to see good care in one another like good parents ought to; recognize that all of us are but children to Mother Nature and Father Fortune. We are so founded beneath them a shared relation to everything we have in the earth and our moments of life. Humanity is but a roving tribe of great orators, storytellers; and givers by nature. We would not take if all had all they would need in abundance- not to use as we would not need but to have as would only necessitate. The idea of the self is so important but its through others we would find purpose and salvation in way of life and what we would do with ourselves. Good willed efforts of your own are admirable but we would all do better to bask in the meditative warmth of other people; work, play- breaks as freely as we would need them. No one owns your time in what would make together all; but it is the most valuable thing I could ask of you. Belay the bad idea about pointed breaks to amend what might be needed in way of rest as we do. People tend to waste themselves in poor-personal consumption of things. We need good work- good people- and good time to play.

As the player, you will take on the role of Autumn, who is in charge of bringing balance to the world and ensuring that each season runs smoothly. Along the way, you will encounter challenges and obstacles that require you to use your problem-solving skills and engage with the other characters to find solutions.

Throughout the game, you will explore the interconnectedness of all things and learn about the importance of caring for yourself and others. The game aims to promote empathy, mindfulness, and self-reflection through its narrative and gameplay mechanics.
Overall, Seasons of Life is a unique and thought-provoking game that encourages players to reflect on the different seasons of their own lives and the importance of finding balance in all things.

We would all love to find ourselves so useful. 
Each character represents a different aspect of human nature and has their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, Winter represents stoicism and resilience, while Spring represents growth and new beginnings.

Overall, Seasons of Life is a unique and thought-provoking game that encourages players to reflect on the different seasons of their own lives and the importance of finding balance in all things.

In this game, you will play as Autumn, one of the four children of Mother Nature and Father Fortune. Each character represents a season and embodies its traits and characteristics.
As Autumn, you are the bridge between Summer and Winter, the seasons of abundance and scarcity. You hold the balance between the two and ensure that everything is in harmony. You have a deep connection with the earth, and your actions affect the world around you.
The game is set in a beautiful and vast world, full of wonder and mystery. You'll explore forests, mountains, and oceans, meeting various characters along the way. You'll learn their stories, help them with their problems, and forge meaningful connections.
But the game is not just about exploration and adventure. It's about self-discovery and finding your place in the world. You'll encounter various challenges that will test your character and values. You'll face difficult choices that will shape your path and the world around you.
True: BUT CORNY AF. “At its core, the game is about relationships and the connections we make with each other and the world. It's about learning to listen, empathize, and care for those around us. It's about finding meaning and purpose in our lives and making a positive impact on the world.”






Dynamics Between People:
I think my imaginings for this game almost make scope creep rear its ugly head. I’d like to build towards demonstrable interpersonal dynamics between a character in the-self, others; if then the player, too.

All I can do is show confidence and see that I justly assure you of my efforts. I will give these related systems and themes grounded potential in the game like I think it so-deserves. In the abstract, [Autumn] is meant to be a relational teacher for players by a way of (self & other) attentional, emotionally-biased weights driving conversations. Characters/NPCs are meant to be the central component of this game; the player should be regarded as secondary in design. As unintuitive as that sounds. 

A player’s interaction with people is not accomplished with ‘text boxes’ or ‘dialogue bubbles’. The conversation system is non-traditional and will need iterative reinvention. Advancements beyond the wheel are possible. We might have an opportunity to create engagement not thought possible in games yet; if we see it fit to utilize LLM technology, Autumn may take a form unlike anything you could ever imagine; characters could say and say all they wanted.

These symbols I dub ‘Enacts’ will route players along paths of interest; far into a character’s “knowledge”. Difficulty comes in design. When I say ‘talk’ in context to the game I mean the thing of using these symbols to converse. 

There would be no ‘end’ to a (LLM Operated) discussion for as long as the player finds good routes in engagement for themselves and the character themselves does not get bored or too eager to do something else. You may not ask unto someone forever. — Characters (NPCs) may tend to other tasks as you talk on things; the player might be requested to do things in aid of the other person that would talk to them. [...]

In good design, could teach in fables and rhetorical conversations maintained from our system of values; then too, our expressions. The player will find best engagement by witnessing the lives of [those here] or finding engagement in say-so, rhetoric, or speech they might receive from NPCs. They may not be able to ask explicit questions, [...]
Balancing Enact Returns:
We would all love to find ourselves so useful. In the game, these acts of conversation go forward nigh naturally as real form discussions; you would have long form; rhetorical or situational, all dialogue Autumn may “drive out” is prewritten; exhaustible, only to give those characters ‘roles’ to say on things the player would make request of.

Your reading of behaviors is not a thing of true knowledge to that person. If we have breakings unknown to people; then things that would need work. They are ‘known’ only to us; not readily seen to anyone’s mind- so be ourselves. 

New people are easiest to converse with because they would not find so many faults in us; an impression of someone lasts for as long as they’d be in presence to us, actions and unseen behavior may find them to best interest in us- all unto confusion, these things of feelings on another without need be context to who they are; then to in way of unknowing- unwanting of another in these selfish acts of severance.

Each character has internalized expressions that go on during a conversation- biases, impulses; wants to say so more than the player might. They may feel at points interrupted or urge to find silence in themselves to listen; then to more-say so on what Autumn would need from the character in these narrative objectives we would set out for them. She may have a journal to remember on things that people have asked of her (for good affordance), but if we do justice to the writing there will be any number of through lines for her to follow between characters and events.

The system I have built already definitely needs revision but I don’t know where to begin without going to describe the enacts. Otherwise you would see no function in the system “right, but how do we interact with characters?” 
Engaging With Conversation:
Autumn has many scripted paths for her expression and it is through selecting ‘enacts’ that represent an emotive direction a conversation would have. The player will see these symbols held over their own heads when they find expression in the dialogue trees; waiting for them to rise is giving time to character before you say-so. 

Saying in effect without letting it rise all the way will mean you can only say so much of the text at a time. Stutter, say parts. But if you want a full-say you must give ear for a longer period of time. There needs to be a tug of war here and I’m not describing it to good effect.

If the player would like to listen, they need only do nothing. To say, the player would use these symbols so causing an enact in way of verbal, pre-written expressions that would follow to Autumn's way of reason to characters. 

In these actions, the player will press LT or RT to further their own dialogue; let go to listen; tap either trigger to say quick affirmations- give rapid emotes/anims to things said- hold it to follow the course of what is respectively said by Autumn in her goals. The player may not always say and say and say because characters will break pace and ask questions to other paths in the dialogue trees. Characters would use ChatGPT for servicing dialogue in the system’s constraints. They can talk on themselves infinitely (as the characters); to others, and then the player.

Unintended breaks in dialogue may happen if the player would insist too much on an ask without following good routes of conversation to ‘see eye to eye’ and find shared goals with characters; these unsaid objectives/story.

The ‘bored’ count will affect this; if a character gets [reduced] in bored too much (say, this model would see interest elsewhere) the player would be disaffected from conversation. Characters may also accrue too much ‘bored’ which would drive them to talk to other models or even seek out companionship in the player.

If Autumn runs out of dialogue the conversation is over. ChatGPT would resume to conversation among other models in the game; the player may interrupt, express on what they would ask of her; then use further ‘enacts’ (general expressions) to further their own say so (even if she would have no dialogue to run through herself. 

In this way, you may always continue talking to characters and witness them talking to others. The player may always interject and ‘enact’ to express on directions they would like to see the conversation go; effectively giving feeling to the routes and implicitly directing return in expression from those others. 

The Systems Related
See the Enact Dialogue System for reference to these symbols; they are given context here-

How much difficulty do you have in expressing yourself in the ways of your life?

Enacts are internalized feelings- but also non-binary ‘replies’, retorts, and emphases to the way dialogue is driven. Ultimately, weights for how these character engagements will go; what Autumn’s pre-written dialogue will bring out in someone’s rhetorical drivers in the moment she interacts with them. Any moment in time goes with a certain say so to explain what it is you would be doing. My moment feels false but the thing of this document is so very needed to be done. If you would feel ‘true’ you would be- ‘living in the moment’ and giving yourself fully to whatever thing you would have yourself to. Enacts give characters a groundedness for their betters as good life does for us.

These symbols are how I think we’ll convey contextualized expression from characters to the player.

This key point is crucial- this would generate almost spontaneous responses in all the characters- given they spend time talking to other people- when Autumn arrives- if she’s left the day to too many things at home; said she was worth so much time to other things- she may arrive to the village and see that they have already repaired the dam. These expressionary symbols are meant to bring out humanity.

The symbols and this dialogue system would grant the player and characters discernible abilities in emotional conveyance between actors in the world. If someone wants for something or ‘of someone’, they would use their best apparent (available) expression to relate the idea. —These Enacts would give players and AI models alike means of driving their wants, language, and asks in a way that relates emotionally. 

In this game the dialogue will come from the directing cast, written expression may develop from inherited baselines for each of the NPCs as they would speak into the dialogue system; given address to these ‘enacts’, expressive symbols as way of communication to the player on things of a shared interest. Characters would speak to any others, regard-themselves; then [if] give interest to any narrative-driven concerns our player-character; items of engagement that Autumn would ask of- or speak to them about.

We give Autumn, Mother Nature, Father Fortune, and then their daughters, Winter, Summer, & Spring. In narrative interest I would need to contrive events that would bring these people together. If our thing is to hold ground among others we would have a quick synopsis of what the game is. 

Then to fuller, more-realized needs to the characters. 
 
The player can use these symbols in conversations with characters in the game, and each symbol has a specific meaning and the potential use-case is variable; but discernible in character feedback. The symbols are meant to be used to express emotions, motivations, and intentions in conversation. The characters in the game also have their own internalized enacts that drive their behaviors. The player's expression and use of the enacts will affect the outcomes of conversations and the actions of the characters. The goal is to create a believable and interactive dialogue system that allows for a meaningful exchange between the player and the characters in the game.
Representative, expressionary symbols that enable the player and characters alike to ‘respond’ to other people using them in ways that are conversationally reactive. For practical example, I’ll explain how this system would work if we were to implement it into our revived project. In that game, I would assume our player character (PC) is Autumn. To solve many of the world’s problems, she must have ‘dialogues’ with non-player characters (NPCs) to make progress in narrative events or resolve journal objectives.
The World of Ether
Emulation of the Natural World
We would emulate the natural world as historically as possible. If the world would have birds, we would give them chirps, calls, and chimes that would correlate with specific species, have a mechanic to sight and key on birds of interest, and we might emulate their ordinary behaviors.
Thematic, Fabled Storytelling
We would all love to find ourselves so useful. In the game the act of conversation goes as so-naturally as real form; as said, this means many of the narrative issues related to the player and seen in the game world are interpersonal in nature. Players would find paths of conversation that bring them closer to the goals they’d find themselves with. 
[There is no draw to an adventure; no compelling movement of the narrative beyond the people of the forest]

”This could involve examining the use of allegory, symbolism, and character development in traditional fables, as well as exploring new and innovative approaches to storytelling. Additionally, you could consider the role that body language, tone of voice, and other nonverbal cues play in conveying meaning and emotion in [these enacts]. 

The study of human behavior and interpersonal dynamics could also inform your writing and development of these enactments. By considering the psychological and social factors that drive human behavior, you may be able to create more complex and nuanced characters and narratives.

It would be useful to study various storytelling techniques and structures.”

Of Autumn’s Responsibility
In the game characters (models) can initiate conversation and talk to each other. They may give on their thoughts, hear on someone’s concerns, ask questions; all without the player's involvement. The player character (Autumn) and other NPCs (models) will engage in conversation using a set of expressions which are represented by the "enact" symbols. Any character can initiate conversation using these symbols. What Autumn is to be for those other people.

The ‘behaved’ interest level of the NPCs is represented in "bored count" checks.

If a character gets too bored, they may seek out other companionship or talk to other models. If a character runs out of dialogue, the conversation ends. The player can always try to interrupt and make the attempt to redirect a conversation using misaligned enacts even if the character they are talking to has no more dialogue. If Autumn runs out of dialogue, however; the conversation is over. They may only emote.

The other characters, which are powered by ChatGPT, will continue to have conversation and the player may still interact with them by using the "enacts."

In the game, characters, including ChatGPT, can initiate conversations and talk to each other without the player's involvement. The player can choose to listen to these conversations or interject at any time by using the enact symbols. The character Autumn, who the player controls, has a set amount of pre-written dialogue which may run out and end the conversation. However, even when Autumn runs out of dialogue, the player can still express their own thoughts and opinions using the enact symbols. This allows for continuous conversation with other characters and gives the player the ability to influence the direction of the conversation.
Development & Design Goals

The act of conversation goes as so-naturally as real form 

"Conveying Game Ideas: Balancing Conventions and Innovation"
As soon as a game is 'announced', people will begin to form ideas of what it might be like. To be best conveyed to people, we must not 'talk past' the most-realized scope. I definitely see the trap developers tend to fall into. Seeing that you demonstrate the game and what it may give while it's being built is important to give it momentum when you launch. You can't so-always predict might not survive the full length of production. Genre conventions will say a wealth about how players think a thing is meant to play; then also says what devs think it’s meant to be. 

We don't have to stick to every convention in design 

but we must see to it that dev-talk fits in to a well-reasoned genre players would easily identify with. Players tend not to wander outside of their comfort zones and will stick to whatever games type they most-recognize and find reliable play in. If we are to build anything worth its weight in salt, we must always write characters, in that, they stand at equitable grounding to the player.

"Balancing Character Goals and Player Expectations in Game Design"
Launching a game, you may be given a title sequence, some cinematic to further ground your model of what a game will turn out to be like. The main menu [may] affect your still-developing ideas of what it is you'll be playing, too. Ideally, the front-loaded trailers, screenshots; all else you've heard about a thing will somewhat prepare you for the experience. Expectations come from this idea of game's shared genres, as well.

The player must likewise be afforded a feeling that they are allowed moments for themselves, too. Give the player opportunities to ask time of people; they may find drives of interest to the person. People will often ask about the player. Both the characters and the player can reject said asks. Much of the game-world’s events take place within these social dynamics between models; then the player’s interaction with them using the dialogue system. There would be physical tasks, but must objectives go in way of finding routes to socialize to Autumn’s need be things; people may not so easily give or listen, they would put time to themselves or other matters, still other people.

We should seek to create a wanting in the player for the time of characters; removed from any puzzles or their gamified drivers, we should design and write to give the player opportunities to see that these characters, these people will also want to spend time for themselves and others.

Further complexity will come when we want to weigh character goals against the given asks of the player. So, mayhaps more to consider and build off from, but we'll have to say what affects their feeling of relation to the player and let the characters balance their own needs/wants against the needs/wants of the player and others. Every person should seek an equilibrium in how much they are willing to give/want to receive.

"Using Games to Tackle Modern Issues: The Power of Interactive Storytelling."
We can write fables in the context of grounded characters; reflected in a way that is mirrored to many problems in our modern society. The many most-pressing issues of today are problems we have yet to fully discern. dev-talk should help. If folk tales were meant to teach, books are meant to share knowledge; passive media does not require you to be present for it, I think the interesting thing about games is that they necessitate engagement in ways that other forms of content could not. We can do so much better with good design principles.

"Revolutionizing Narrative in Gaming: A Proposal for Improved Engagement"
People may be intimidated by a lot of text and may not even so much as read the narrative you put into the game. This idea here was to hold their present mind in long-rhetoric; good writing will do that normally, but I have even better ideas to keep people minded to what's being said in dev-talk. Talking to characters as the best engagement.

Games tend to be thing we are meant to be 'forwarding' through at all times. A game will feel best if we feel competent and can say we know what we are doing at any given moment. If a player does not have objective in mind, they will have feelings of being lost; and- unless given other things to do —time to idle away from the problem, they will go on to be frustrated, bored, and then likely quit the game. In this thing of ethical design, we want people to feel they can quit; feeling they have enough save-points and 'breaks' between the core gameplay loops. — If narrative is the thing that keeps us focused so much, why not do it better? This wheel needs reinvention.

Another way to parse it, narrative text boxes, dialogue bubbles, and cutscenes are often too slow to keep people engaged; 'gameplay' sometimes goes best without 'story', but story is the thing which keeps us most-centered in an experience. If we have greater ideas (and ties to characters) that say on what the game is and what our role in it is, we will then find ourselves better holding to its attention. I can only speak on system as I remember it, 

We are deterministic creatures. 
“Theories of Education: Learning Models and How We Come to Best Knowledge”
There is no single model for how we best learn that is universally accepted, as different individuals have different learning styles and preferences. However, there are several theories and models that suggest how people can learn effectively, such as:
	* Constructivist learning theory: This theory suggests that people construct their own understanding and knowledge through experiences and interactions with their environment.
	* Experiential learning theory: This theory emphasizes the importance of hands-on, real-life experiences in learning.
	* Social learning theory: This theory suggests that people learn through observing and imitating others.
	* Brain-based learning theory: This theory focuses on how the brain processes information and how to optimize learning based on our understanding of how the brain works.
	* Multiple intelligence theory: This theory proposes that individuals have different kinds of intelligence, such as linguistic, musical, or spatial intelligence, and that different teaching methods are needed for different types of intelligence.
Ultimately, the best teaching approach may vary depending on the individual, the subject matter, and the learning environment. [ChatGPT]
“Mention of a ‘sixth’ model in context of procedural rhetoric”
“Saying On" to learn; then procedural rhetoric, which explains and emphasizes the importance of active, engaged, and experiential learning. In this model, learners would be encouraged to engage in conversations, debates, and discussions about the material they are studying. This would involve not only listening to what others have to say but also speaking up and offering their own perspectives. In addition, learners would be encouraged to engage in hands-on activities, simulations, and other types of active learning experiences that help to bring the material to life and make it more meaningful. The goal of this model would be to help learners to internalize the material and understand it on a deeper level, rather than simply memorizing information.”

Other Essentials of Game Design

The thing about tutorials is all that important. If someone does not have a good expectation of what it is they may be confronting, they may not see themselves playing past the game's introduction. Inventions of good tutorials wouldn’t detract from the player's experience; Autumn’s tutorials should be designed to be comprehensive and accessible to all players, regardless of their prior knowledge or experience. They need not be intrusive or ‘take control’. 

Expectations

As soon as a game is 'announced', people will begin to form ideas of what it might be like. To be best conveyed to people, we must not 'talk past' the most-realized scope. [I see the trap developers tend to fall into. Seeing that you demonstrate the game while it's being built is important to give it momentum when you launch. 

Designing a good experience goes with incredible complexity and you can't always predict might not survive the full length of production]. Genre conventions will say a wealth about how players think a thing is meant to play; then also says what devs think it's meant to be. We don't have to stick to every convention in design but we must see to it that #dev-talk fits into a well-reasoned genre players would easily identify with. 

Players tend not to wander outside of their comfort zones and will stick to whatever games type they most recognize and find reliable play in. *If we are to build anything worth its weight in salt*, we must always write characters in that they stand at equitable grounding to the player.

immersion
Otherwise known as *the magic circle*; this thing you would step into or 'feel'. To other words, *to be so drawn-into a game* you could not so easily remove yourself from it. Much of this goes to how a game 'feels' in the pressing of buttons and what we would see our characters or ourselves doing. The literal components on the screen and those ideas on how we should be playing the thing. And it goes with great regard, the thing of Audio is indelibly important- the thing of Music, equally so. If we cannot align our wants for a game with the resulting gameplay.

assistance
Good designers will have a solid confidence in the player's best understanding. — But they will also '*give more*' to what a person may think themselves capable of. An AI 'missing' projectiles; Keeping a player alive against the odds of several more 'would-be' death states by staggering the enemies; Creating (hidden) advantages in the economy to sustain players resources at a baseline; Making that last bit of health count for more than the rest; Seeing that they have a good buffer to make a jump by giving them 'coyote-time'. Or simply seeing that a character controller does not stick to objects in the world. See that a player feels the game is 'fair'.

puzzles


exploration


Example ‘Enact’ Scenarios

Water well scenario
If you need water from a well and a character has access to it, the player may go over to the well and pull water up; paying no mind to the person that may own it/reside there. – Or they may ask the owner if they may use the well. The resulting scenarios will differ depending on a character’s temperament towards you and your response to their expression on the want/ask. 

Are you reprimanded for using someone’s well without their permission? Did you apologize to them and have the well granted to you, or did you entitle yourself towards it and reject the person’s might-be wants? If you asked, do they decline your use of it? Is there a way you can negotiate your use of the well? If they say yes, is saying thanks enough, or will they impose other wants? 

If they say no, is there anything you can do to convince them of your need? Would you be able to convince them that the water is needed? If your negotiation for wants fails does that mean the forest fire you’re trying to put out grows in intensity? Can you impose your will to save the fire from spreading further? Would you wait until this person recognizes the need themselves? 

Bramble-bush scenario
A character is stuck in bramble-bush thorns? They may ask for help, you may want to do so immediately, but, given your help, the effort will need to go on while ensuring they do not sustain injury in the process of freeing them. Communication throughout the scenario will make certain they are not harmed more than they’ve already been. No communication at all means you would just impose your will on them and pull them out without negotiation, probably hurting them in the process. You may also leave them or find others to help.


Scenes for Feeling of the World

Route Unexpected
You’re taking a train but have missed your stop, you’re there long enough without much to do but tinker in your journal and take in the view. People scatter themselves on the train, taking seats to console themselves in corners, nooks, and sit among each other to keep enough attention to themselves and might-be peers. The scenery goes on by and past you as it goes. There is some contentment to your being lost. 

In What We Do
You’ve prepared yourself for board games with friends, been on a long walk up the mountain to meet up with them all. Great memories of them and you together. — The sun is long-set; the stars shine through what sky isn’t full of clouds. You think of long-awaited adventures and a return to worlds that have kept your mind so well. Life seems tangible in the feeling of spending time with friends in these imagined worlds; more real than anything else.

Journey Ahead
You’re on a long bicycle ride to see old friends after so much life has passed you on. The day is so bright to your mind; the wind carries against you, — wheels on your bike flying ahead, you take great, winding strides along the earthen, deeply-carved bike trails. All of the earth is novel to your mind; the sounds of creatures unseen; these oh so unknown bellows, calls, chimes, and chirps of mother nature take your heart aflutter to places anew. 


Misc.

Would you give me a prompt for each of the other three sister seasons and then the parents?
Sure, here are some prompts for the other seasons and parents:
Spring: As Spring, you are the embodiment of growth and renewal. Your village depends on you to bring life back to the land after a long, harsh winter. But your giving nature often leaves you depleted and worn out. As you balance your responsibilities to your village with your own needs, you'll discover the power of setting boundaries and asking for help.
Summer: As Summer, you are the season of abundance and joy. Your warm personality and sunny disposition make you the life of the party, and your village looks to you to provide them with all the bounties of the harvest. But your outward happiness masks a deep-seated fear of being alone. As you journey through the world of Ether, you'll learn to face your fears and find true inner peace.
Winter: As Winter, you are the season of rest and introspection. Your hearth is a place of quiet reflection, and your village looks to you to provide them with respite from the harsh winter winds. But your isolation has led you to question your purpose and worth, and you struggle to connect with others. As you explore the world of Ether, you'll discover the power of vulnerability and the beauty of connection.
Mother Nature & Father Fortune: As Mother Nature and Father Fortune, you are the powerful guardians of the world of Ether. Your children, the sister seasons, depend on you to provide guidance and support as they navigate their responsibilities. But your own relationship is strained, and you struggle to communicate effectively with each other. As you work together to guide your children and protect the world of Ether, you'll learn the importance of trust and cooperation.


Mother Nature and Father Fortune, described separately.
Mother Nature: An ethereal figure, enigmatic and ancient, whose every movement echoes throughout the world of Ether. She is the embodiment of the natural world, the mother of all living things, and the guardian of the seasons. Her power is great, her wisdom vast, and her presence awe-inspiring. She speaks in a voice that echoes like the wind through the trees, and her touch is as gentle as the first spring breeze. To encounter her is to experience the very essence of nature.
Father Fortune: A figure of immense wealth and power, whose every word and action carries great weight. He is the embodiment of prosperity and success, the patron of all merchants and traders, and the guardian of the economy. His power is great, his wealth vast, and his presence intimidating. He speaks in a voice that commands attention and respect, and his touch is as firm as a banker's handshake. To encounter him is to experience the very essence of wealth and success.


'life of the party' threw off the prompt for Summer, would you convey her differently? Here are new descriptions for the characters I had forgotten to give you. Father Fortune has to be hardened in his ideals. 'work is our merit, labor is our value' we would not see purpose without it, he says. A sharp contrast to Mother Nature. 'People are our home, people are our hearth' if we would give to the world then they would return to us. Winter has given herself self-ascribed importance. Does not see any relational worth in building relationships with the people in her village. Sees to her responsibilities and then returns to her own time. Where is the flaw in this? She is lost on her own. Does not see any good expression at home. Often has destructive habits we would need to abstract for the audience so that they can project a bit. Spring sees great value in people but does not so recognize her own worth. People may take more than they ought. She may give more than she is able. If Spring is our idealized giver, she is being taken advantage of. Autumn will not so quickly recognize this shortcoming. Summer is difficult. This one is so good, so sincere about her given purpose that she does not falter in it. Like Mother Nature. She will afford the people of her hearth everything they would require. Do it with a 'strongly convincing' smile that puts people at ease. A resting reassurance in her voice that lets people know they will be okay. This is a strange façade. Autumn will have to try exceptionally hard to get past the barrier to deeper conversations with her. Summer is 'always busy' and does not have 'extra time' for her sister when Autumn would push on these related concerns. Summer is deeply depressed but she would not so admit this to anyone. Only continues to work,
Sure, here are new prompts for each of the characters:
Summer: Summer is the lifeblood of her village, always ready to lend a helping hand to anyone in need. Her sincerity and warmth are contagious, and she exudes an air of unwavering confidence and positivity that inspires those around her. But beneath her cheerful exterior lies a deep sense of loneliness and exhaustion, as she struggles to keep up with the demands of her role. How can Autumn reach out to her sister and offer her the support she needs?
Spring: Spring is the embodiment of generosity and kindness, always putting others before herself. She has a boundless well of love to offer, but often forgets to save some for herself. Autumn may see her as an idealized giver, but people may take more than they ought, leaving Spring with little energy to care for herself. Can Autumn help Spring find a balance between giving and receiving?
Winter: Winter is a loner, content with her responsibilities but lost in her own world. She sees no value in building relationships with the people in her village and has destructive habits that she keeps hidden from others. Autumn must work to understand her sister's struggles and help her find her way back to the community that needs her.
Mother Nature: Mother Nature is the nurturing force that holds the world of Ether together. She sees people as the heart and soul of everything, and her love for them is boundless. But her deep empathy can also make her vulnerable to the pain and suffering of others, and she carries the weight of the world on her shoulders. How can Autumn support her mother and remind her that she too needs care and rest?
Father Fortune: Father Fortune believes in the power of hard work and the value of labor. He sees purpose in every task, no matter how small, and holds himself and others to a high standard of productivity. But his rigid ideals can make it difficult for him to connect with others on an emotional level, and he may struggle to see the importance of rest and relaxation. How can Autumn help her father find a balance between work and play, and encourage him to connect with others on a deeper level?


Describe Mother Nature once more, that same prompt. But give her some visage of wisdom in age. Add some level of fantasy, maybe pride to Father Fortune in his prompt. Use the same paragraphs, just slightly alter the wording to improve each of them.
Mother Nature: An ageless and wise being, her presence commands respect and reverence from all who encounter her. She embodies the beauty and power of nature, with long, flowing hair the color of the forest and piercing green eyes that seem to hold the secrets of the world. Her gentle yet firm voice carries the weight of years of experience, and she radiates an aura of calm and tranquility.
Father Fortune: A proud and dignified figure, Father Fortune exudes an air of authority and competence. He embodies the values of hard work and perseverance, with a strong sense of responsibility to his family and community. His stern visage hides a heart of gold, and those who take the time to know him come to appreciate his wisdom and insight. With a deep, booming voice and piercing blue eyes, he commands attention and respect from all who encounter him.


we ought to reduce Father Fortune's generalized age in that prompt. Midjourney is making a generic old man in robes. This man does work, practical but dignified attire. Some nobility in it, but rigor in the design is foremost. Less pride. More competence.
Sure, here's a revised prompt for Father Fortune:
Father Fortune is a practical man, always dressed in dignified attire that reflects his commitment to hard work and perseverance. His clothes are designed for function and durability, with a touch of nobility in the details. He exudes competence and confidence in everything he does, and his bearing commands respect from those around him.
As the patriarch of the family, Father Fortune values the virtues of hard work, persistence, and diligence. He believes that a person's worth is measured by their contribution to society and their ability to provide for themselves and their family. To him, there is no greater calling than to work with one's hands and earn an honest living.
Despite his seriousness and focus on practical matters, Father Fortune has a kind heart and is always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need. He has a deep love for his family and community and strives to provide for them in every way he can.


Let us see a re-combination of this prompts. "Father Fortune is a practical man, always dressed in dignified attire that reflects his commitment to hard work and perseverance. His clothes are designed for function and durability, with a touch of nobility in the details. He exudes competence and confidence in everything he does, and his bearing commands respect from those around him. As the patriarch of the family, Father Fortune values the virtues of hard work, persistence, and diligence. He believes that a person's worth is measured by their contribution to society and their ability to provide for themselves and their family. To him, there is no greater calling than to work with one's hands and earn an honest living. Despite his seriousness and focus on practical matters, Father Fortune has a kind heart and is always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need. He has a deep love for his family and community and strives to provide for them in every way he can." and "A proud and dignified figure, Father Fortune exudes an air of authority and competence. He embodies the values of hard work and perseverance, with a strong sense of responsibility to his family and community. His stern visage hides a heart of gold, and those who take the time to know him come to appreciate his wisdom and insight. With a deep, booming voice and piercing blue eyes, he commands attention and respect from all who encounter him." We need to be somewhere in the middle.
Let me try to merge the two prompts together:
Father Fortune is a practical man who values hard work and perseverance above all else. He dresses in dignified attire that reflects his commitment to function and durability, with a touch of nobility in the details. His bearing exudes competence and confidence, commanding respect from those around him. As the patriarch of the family, Father Fortune believes that a person's worth is measured by their contribution to society and their ability to provide for themselves and their family. He takes great pride in his ability to work with his hands and earn an honest living, but also recognizes the importance of compassion and kindness. Despite his stern visage, Father Fortune has a heart of gold and is always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need. He deeply loves his family and community, and strives to provide for them in every way he can.


Would you please give me a more relatable description of Mother Nature? Autumn looks up to her, so do her sisters. She has a mutual regard for Father Fortune.
Sure, here's a revised prompt for Mother Nature:
"Mother Nature is a warm and nurturing presence, with a deep love and respect for all living things. Her clothes are simple and practical, designed for comfort and ease of movement as she tends to the needs of her beloved children - the plants, animals, and people of the world. She exudes a sense of calm and wisdom, and her kind eyes radiate an inner beauty and grace that draws people to her. Autumn and her sisters look up to her as a role model, and her mutual regard for Father Fortune is evident in the balance and harmony they have achieved together. Despite the challenges and hardships that come with caring for the world, Mother Nature remains steadfast in her love and devotion to all those under her care."


I loved your original descriptions of both of them. Please do not lose value in these words: "Mother Nature is the nurturing force that holds the world of Ether together. She sees people as the heart and soul of everything, and her love for them is boundless. But her deep empathy can also make her vulnerable to the pain and suffering of others, and she carries the weight of the world on her shoulders. How can Autumn support her mother and remind her that she too needs care and rest?" "Father Fortune believes in the power of hard work and the value of labor. He sees purpose in every task, no matter how small, and holds himself and others to a high standard of productivity. But his rigid ideals can make it difficult for him to connect with others on an emotional level, and he may struggle to see the importance of rest and relaxation. How can Autumn help her father find a balance between work and play, and encourage him to connect with others on a deeper level?"
Certainly, here are revised descriptions of both Mother Nature and Father Fortune that are more relatable:
"Mother Nature is the heart and soul of the world of Ether. She sees people as the core of everything, and her love for them is boundless. Her deep empathy can make her vulnerable to the pain and suffering of others, but she remains steadfast in her commitment to nurturing the world and its inhabitants. Autumn looks up to her mother, and her sisters also hold her in high regard. But as the caretaker of the world, Mother Nature can sometimes forget to take care of herself. Autumn must remind her mother that self-care is important, and that she too needs rest and rejuvenation."
"Father Fortune is a hardworking and practical man who values the power of labor and perseverance. He sees purpose in every task and strives to hold himself and others to a high standard of productivity. His strong work ethic can be inspiring, but his rigid ideals can sometimes make it difficult for him to connect with others on an emotional level. Despite this, Father Fortune loves his family and community deeply, and will do anything to provide for them. Autumn may struggle to connect with her father, but through patience and understanding, she can help him find a balance between work and play, and encourage him to connect with others on a deeper level."
In this world of Autumn, we find ourselves in a cozy personal library, lined with books along the walls, and ladders splayed around the room to reach them. The architecture is smartly designed, bringing light to the room without being too direct, creating a warm and inviting ambiance that is enhanced by the gentle flicker of candlelight and the warmth of a fireplace at night.
Autumn is a time of change, and the characters that inhabit this world are diverse and unique. From the mischievous Spring to the steadfast Winter, each character brings something special to the table. However, the titular character, Autumn, is the one that ties everything together. She is curious and adventurous, always seeking new experiences and connections with others.
As we explore this world, we discover that the characters are brought to life through the Enacts system. This system allows for meaningful interactions between characters, where dialogue and expression are used to convey their feelings and thoughts. It is through their interactions with one another that their stories unfold, and it is up to the player, who inhabits the character of Autumn, to engage with them and help to solve any interpersonal issues that may arise, forging deeper connections with each character.
The library, which serves as the backdrop for many of these interactions, is a place of knowledge and reflection, where characters come to seek solace and guidance. The smartly designed architecture of the library creates a warm and inviting ambiance, allowing characters to explore and discover new ideas in a peaceful and relaxing environment.
Overall, the world of Autumn is a place of growth and discovery, where characters learn the importance of empathy, listening, and responding to others, and finding one's own place in the world. Through the Enacts system and the interconnected stories of its characters, players are invited to join in this journey, creating something beautiful together.
Welcome to "Seasons of Life," an adventure game that takes you on a journey through the different seasons of life, as seen through the eyes of Mother Nature and Father Fortune and their four children: Winter, Spring, Summer, and Autumn. As the player, you will take on the role of Autumn, the character who represents balance and harmony.
Autumn's personal library serves as the player's home residence, a hub where they can rest, reflect, read, discover, and contemplate. The library is not the center of the story, but it is where players return to recharge and plan their next moves.
Through the use of the enact system, players engage in dialogue and interactions with the other characters, learning more about their individual stories and helping them navigate their personal struggles. The changing seasons also play a crucial role in the game's narrative, as the world shifts and transforms with each passing season, presenting new challenges and opportunities for both the characters and players.
Each character embodies a different aspect of human nature, with their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, Winter represents stoicism and resilience, while Spring represents growth and new beginnings. Summer, the character of abundance, could be interpreted as a time of flourishing, discovery, exploration, adventure, and celebration. Autumn's role is to ensure that each season runs smoothly, acting as the bridge between Summer and Winter, and holding the balance between the two.
In this game, you'll explore a vast world full of wonder and mystery, where you'll meet various characters, learn their stories, help them with their problems, and forge meaningful connections. The game is not just about exploration and adventure, but also about self-discovery and finding your place in the world. You'll encounter challenges that will test your character and values, and make difficult choices that will shape your path and the world around you.
Ultimately, "Seasons of Life" is a unique and thought-provoking game that encourages players to reflect on the different seasons of their own lives and the importance of finding balance in all things. As you play through the game, you'll learn about the interconnectedness of all things and the importance of caring for yourself and others. The game aims to promote empathy, mindfulness, and self-reflection through its narrative and gameplay mechanics.
As Autumn, you are the player character who holds the balance between abundance and scarcity, and your actions affect the world around you. You have a deep connection with the earth, and your journey through the different seasons of life will help you find your place in the world.
The world of Ether is inhabited by a diverse range of creatures, including humans, animals, and other mystical beings. The inhabitants of Ether are deeply connected to nature, and they live in harmony with the natural world. The world is rich with flora and fauna, and the inhabitants of Ether have developed a deep understanding of the natural world and its many secrets.
The library in Ether is a sacred place, filled with ancient texts and knowledge that has been passed down through generations. The library is home to the world's most comprehensive collection of books and other written works, and it is revered by the inhabitants of Ether as a place of learning and wisdom.
In terms of interpersonal goals for the player character, Autumn is meant to be a relational teacher, guiding players through conversations with NPCs using emotionally-biased weights to drive the interactions. The conversation system in the game is non-traditional, and the player's interaction with people is not accomplished through text boxes or dialogue bubbles. Instead, the player uses Enacts, or internalized feelings, to guide conversations with NPCs.
The Enact Dialogue System is a crucial part of the game, as it allows players to express emotions, motivations, and intentions in conversation. The system is meant to create a believable and interactive dialogue system that allows for a meaningful exchange between the player and the characters in the game. Each symbol has a specific meaning, and the potential use-case is variable, but discernible in character feedback.
As the player progresses through the game, they may choose how to spend their time and who to spend it with. The player's direction in the pursuit of knowledge, wisdom, and peace among the inhabitants of Ether is up to them, but Autumn is expected to give herself to the people of Ether and fulfill her responsibility in this act. Autumn's sisters are also meant to do the same, and the player may learn from their teachings as well.
Overall, the world of Ether is a mystical and wondrous place, filled with ancient knowledge and secrets waiting to be discovered. The inhabitants of Ether are deeply connected to nature, and they live in harmony with the natural world. The Enact Dialogue System allows players to interact with these inhabitants in a meaningful way, guiding them through emotionally-driven conversations that will shape the course of the game.
To summarize, the World of Ether game aims to emulate the natural world and incorporate fabled storytelling with a focus on interpersonal dynamics between characters. The development and design goals involve balancing conventions and innovation, balancing character goals and player expectations, and using games to tackle modern issues through interactive storytelling. The proposal for improved engagement suggests reinventing narrative to better hold players' attention and tying it to character engagement. In terms of learning models, the theories of constructivist, experiential, social, brain-based, and multiple intelligence learning are discussed, as well as the sixth model of procedural rhetoric, which emphasizes active, engaged, and experiential learning through conversations, debates, and hands-on activities.

It seems like the game Autumn is meant to explore the theme of care-giving and how different individuals approach this responsibility. The three sisters, Winter, Summer, and Spring, serve as models for different approaches to care-giving. The player, as Autumn, is expected to learn from these models and find a balance between caring for others and caring for oneself.
There is a conflict between the ideals of Mother Nature and Father Fortune (society) regarding care-giving, and Autumn is expected to navigate this conflict. The game explores the degrees of selfishness/selflessness and how this relates to care-giving.
There are also specific issues that each sister struggles with in relation to care-giving. For example, Spring may give too much and not receive enough gratitude in return, while Summer may give too much of herself and not know how to receive help from others. Winter may struggle with the balance between giving too much and not giving at all.
As the player navigates these different approaches to care-giving, they are expected to ascribe responsibilities to the world and prioritize tasks based on the needs of the community. There is also a suggestion that the player may need to find a balance between caring for others and caring for themselves.
Overall, the game Autumn seems to be a thoughtful exploration of care-giving and the different approaches that individuals may take to this responsibility. The player is expected to learn from the models provided by the three sisters and find their own balance between caring for others and caring for themselves.
Certainly, these themes can be connected to real-world science in several ways. For example, research in social psychology has shown that people's willingness to help others is influenced by various factors, including their personality traits, social norms, and the perceived costs and benefits of helping. Additionally, studies on empathy have found that people are more likely to help others when they can understand and relate to their experiences.
Furthermore, there is a growing body of research on the impact of social support and caregiving on health and well-being. For instance, studies have shown that social support can buffer the negative effects of stress on physical and mental health. Caregiving, on the other hand, can be both rewarding and challenging, and can have both positive and negative effects on the caregiver's health and well-being.
In terms of the different models of care-giving represented by the sisters in your writing, we can draw parallels to different caregiving styles that have been identified in research on parenting. For example, the "authoritative" style is characterized by warmth and responsiveness, while also setting clear limits and expectations. The "permissive" style, on the other hand, is characterized by high warmth and low control, while the "authoritarian" style is characterized by low warmth and high control.
Overall, these themes can be explored in depth through interdisciplinary research that draws on fields such as psychology, sociology, and health sciences.
Certainly, I can give it a try. Here is a revised synopsis:
As Autumn, you are tasked with the responsibility of caring for your community and loved ones, but you must also learn to care for yourself. Your sisters, each with their unique approach to caregiving, offer valuable lessons, but also present challenges to the balance between caring for yourself and others.
Through gameplay, you will explore the different caregiving styles of your sisters and learn how to set boundaries, prioritize your needs, and give in a way that is true to your values and strengths. By finding a balance between caring for others and yourself, you will discover a more fulfilling and sustainable approach to caregiving.
This game is designed for anyone who values the importance of caregiving and wants to explore different approaches to it. We hope to offer a representation of the expectations society places on women in particular, but this game is not limited to any one gender. Whether you are a parent, grandparent, or simply someone who cares for others, Autumn offers an opportunity to learn and grow in your caregiving abilities.
We have been discussing the concept of a game centered around the theme of caregiving, with a focus on the different styles of giving represented by the four seasons. We have talked about how each season embodies a different approach to caregiving, and how these approaches can be both positive and negative depending on the situation.
We have discussed how the game could be designed to challenge these norms and encourage the player to cultivate a more mindful and intentional approach to caregiving, with a focus on setting boundaries and valuing one's own contributions. We have also talked about how the game could appeal to a caring demographic, particularly women, parents, and grandparents.

The world of Ether is a place of magic and wonder, a place where the boundaries between reality and fantasy are blurred. At the heart of this world lies the Library, a vast repository of knowledge and wisdom that is said to hold the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe.
The sister seasons, Autumn, Winter, Spring, and Summer, each represent a different approach to caring for others. Autumn is the caretaker of all the people of Ether, responsible for ensuring that they are well-cared for and nurtured. Winter is more cynical, giving but not reflecting on it, and tending to her own things. Summer gives in abundance, but suffers in isolation because she believes it is justified. Spring gives so much that people walk all over her and do not show gratitude for what she does.
Father Fortune represents society's expectations of how much we should give of ourselves. How much are we meant to give, and how can we give 'rightly' for others without neglecting ourselves? Mother Nature gives in abundance, but she has greater responsibilities to the earth and cannot see to the good care of Autumn or her sisters.
The Library is a place of great power and knowledge, but it is also a place of danger. The guardians of the Library are fierce and powerful, and they will stop at nothing to protect the knowledge within its walls. Only a select few are allowed to enter the Library, and those who do must be prepared to face incredible challenges and tests of their courage and wisdom.
The world of Ether is full of mysteries and secrets, and Autumn must learn to navigate its many dangers and challenges if she is to fulfill her role as caretaker of all its people. Through her journey, she will discover the true meaning of caring for others, and how to balance that with caring for herself.
Public events: It sounds like the Library of Ether is not just a place for quiet study, but also a hub for social and intellectual activities. What kind of events might take place there? Perhaps there are regular lectures, workshops, or discussion groups on various topics, hosted by different members of the community. Or there could be special events tied to certain books or themes, like book clubs or author readings. The library could also be a place for public debate or even performances, like poetry or music. The possibilities are endless!
The value of knowledge: You mention that reading is highly valued in Ether, but not everyone sees themselves as scholars. I'm curious about how knowledge is perceived in this society overall. Is it seen as a means to an end, a way to achieve personal or community goals? Or is knowledge valued for its own sake, as a way to expand one's understanding of the world and oneself? Are there any beliefs or traditions around the pursuit of knowledge? For example, is it seen as a noble pursuit, a spiritual path, or a way to connect with ancestors or spirits?
The Library of Ether is a cozy yet expansive space that contains a wide breadth of knowledge, much like the historic Library of Alexandria. It is open to everyone, with no restrictions on access, and is a centerpiece of culture in the world of Ether. Reading is highly valued here, and people may spend days or even weeks pursuing knowledge within its heightened walls.
The library economy is also an important aspect of this space, with people owing each other pages of text in reading responsibility as a means of fulfilling promises or making amends. Public events are also common, and there are no ranked professionals or declared scholars. All inhabitants of Ether see good value in their own pursuits of knowledge, life, love, and community, and these values are not mutually exclusive.
The value of knowledge in Ether is immeasurable, as it serves as the foundation for all aspects of life, love, and community. It is seen as a means of personal growth and self-improvement, as well as a way to contribute to the betterment of society as a whole. The tradition of owing pages to others in the library economy also serves as a means of demonstrating knowledge and perspective, further emphasizing its value.
As for the follow-up prompt, let us imagine a festival in the world of Ether that celebrates the value of knowledge. The festival brings together people from all walks of life to share their knowledge and insights, with various events such as speeches, debates, and presentations. In addition to showcasing the importance of knowledge, the festival also emphasizes the interconnectedness of all aspects of life in Ether, from knowledge to love to community. How might Midjourney design this festival to be both entertaining and thought-provoking for players, while also staying true to the values and themes of Ether?
Midjourney, can you generate an image of a bustling marketplace in the world of Ether, where merchants and artisans of all kinds gather to sell their wares? In this world, the characters are anthropomorphic, so you may see rabbits running a bakery, or cats selling handmade jewelry. The market is filled with colorful stalls, each one offering a unique and fascinating product. Imagine the smells of freshly baked bread, the sounds of musicians playing lively tunes, and the chatter of vendors haggling with customers. Maybe you can even add in some fantasy elements, like a dragon merchant selling rare gems, or a goblin tinkerer peddling magical trinkets. Bring the vibrant and diverse culture of Ether to life in this image.
For the library prompt, can you generate an image of the Library of Ether, a cozy yet expansive space that contains a wide breadth of knowledge? Imagine shelves upon shelves of books, ancient tomes, and scrolls, all filled with the wisdom of the ages. The library is a bustling hub of intellectual activity, with people of all ages and backgrounds poring over texts, engaging in lively debates, or quietly reflecting on what they've read. Perhaps you can add some fantasy elements, like enchanted tomes that glow softly, or a winged librarian who flits from shelf to shelf, retrieving books for patrons. In this world, the value of knowledge is held in high regard, so be sure to capture the sense of wonder and discovery that permeates the library.
The town square of Ether is a vibrant and bustling center of activity. It's surrounded by tall, whitewashed buildings with colorful awnings and intricate, decorative carvings adorning their facades. In the center of the square stands a large, ornate fountain with a statue of Mother Nature at its center, her arms outstretched and her face upturned towards the sun.
Around the fountain, people of all ages gather to chat, play music, and watch street performers. Vendors sell their wares from colorful tents and stalls, offering everything from freshly-baked pastries to handmade crafts and trinkets. The air is filled with the sound of laughter and conversation, and the scent of freshly-brewed coffee and cooking food.
At one end of the square, there's a small stage where musicians and poets take turns performing for the crowd. At the other end, there's a cozy little library, its shelves lined with books on every topic imaginable. People come and go from the library all day, borrowing and returning books, and engaging in lively discussions with other readers.
The town square is the beating heart of Ether, a place where people come to connect with each other, share their passions, and celebrate the beauty of life.
"Spring is the youngest of the sisters, full of boundless energy and a thirst for knowledge. She is always eager to lend a helping hand and is known for her infectious enthusiasm. However, her eagerness to please can sometimes lead her to take on more than she can handle, and she can become overwhelmed when things don't go according to plan. Despite this, she remains optimistic and always looks for the best in people and situations. Her love of learning is only matched by her love of nature, and she can often be found exploring the forests and meadows of Ether, discovering new wonders and secrets hidden within."
Summer: Standing tall and radiant, Summer exudes warmth and vitality from every inch of her being. Her long, flowing hair is the color of golden wheat, and her eyes sparkle like the sun on a clear day. Her skin is kissed by the sun, and her figure is curvaceous and alluring. Summer is dressed in flowing, diaphanous clothing that sways in the breeze, and she moves with a grace and fluidity that is mesmerizing to watch.
Spring: Spring is young and full of life, with a bright, innocent spirit that radiates from her every movement. She is petite and delicate, with soft features and sparkling eyes that hint at a mischievous streak. Her hair is a riot of curls and colors, framing her face like a halo. She is dressed in simple, comfortable clothing that allows her to move freely and playfully. Despite her youth, there is a strength and resilience in her that belies her size.
Father Fortune is a tall, imposing man, with sharp features and a stern expression. He carries himself with a rigid posture and is always dressed in formal attire, no matter the occasion. His hair is slicked back neatly, and he has a neatly trimmed beard that emphasizes his sharp jawline.
Father Fortune values efficiency and productivity above all else. He measures success by how much work is done in a day, and he has little patience for those who don't share his work ethic. He sees rest and relaxation as a waste of time, and believes that every moment should be spent working towards a goal.
His devotion to work often puts a strain on his relationships, and he struggles to find joy outside of his professional pursuits. He has a hard time understanding those who prioritize leisure or family time over work, and tends to view them as lazy or unmotivated.
Despite his flaws, Father Fortune is respected and admired by many in Ether for his unwavering commitment to his work and his ability to achieve great things through sheer force of will.
Mother Nature sees herself as the caretaker of all living things in the world. She is often seen as a figure of great power, capable of nurturing and sustaining life, but her attention is not equally distributed among her children. She places great value in fulfilling her promises and meeting her responsibilities, but struggles with finding time to connect with and support her dependents on a personal level. She may see the wisdom of the library of Ether as a means of guidance for her children, but remains somewhat distant from them. How can you depict the dichotomy of Mother Nature's power and her sense of distance from those she cares for?"
Mother Nature is a complex figure who embodies the natural world and all its wonders. She is responsible for the growth and sustainability of all life on Ether, and she takes this responsibility seriously. Mother Nature values hard work and dedication, and she is always striving to fulfill her promises to her children.
However, despite her unwavering dedication, Mother Nature struggles with finding a balance between her responsibilities to others and her own needs. She often finds herself distanced from her children, unable to be there for them in the way they need. In this way, she appeals to the wisdom of the library and the guidance of society to help guide her children on their journeys.
Despite her limitations, Mother Nature remains a powerful force, commanding respect and awe from all who encounter her. She is a reminder of the beauty and power of the natural world, and the importance of valuing and protecting it for generations to come.
For the library, we could name it "The Great Repository," emphasizing its importance as a repository of knowledge and wisdom for the people of Ether.
As for other third places, here are a few ideas:

Sure, here are some potential locations that the player might visit in the world of Ether:
	* The Scriptorium: A place where books are meticulously copied by hand and illuminated with intricate designs. The scriptorium is run by a group of scribes who are known for their beautiful calligraphy and attention to detail. The player might visit here to commission a manuscript or learn the art of illumination.

	* Amphitheater:
I apologize for that! For the 9th location, let's imagine a cozy tea house that serves as a gathering spot for community members to relax, socialize, and enjoy a warm cup of tea. The tea house could be decorated with comfortable seating, warm lighting, and a variety of teas from around the world. The atmosphere is welcoming and calming, providing a respite from the hustle and bustle of daily life.
As for a task related to the tea house, perhaps the player could be tasked with organizing a community event, such as a tea tasting or cultural celebration, to bring people together and promote a sense of community. The player would need to work with the tea house owner and other community members to plan and execute the event, making decisions on things like menu items, decorations, and entertainment. The success of the event could be measured by the turnout and positive feedback from attendees.
The Observatory is a towering structure, reaching high above the surrounding buildings of the city. Its location was chosen specifically for its unobstructed view of the night sky, free from the light pollution of the city. At the top of the tower sits the powerful telescope, a state-of-the-art instrument that is the envy of astronomers around the world.
As the player climbs the winding stairs of the tower, they pass by windows that offer glimpses of the city below, growing smaller and smaller as they ascend. Finally, they reach the top of the tower, where they find the astronomers hard at work, peering through the telescope and recording their observations.
The telescope itself is a marvel of engineering, with intricate lenses and mirrors that allow for incredibly precise measurements. The astronomers carefully adjust the telescope, tracking the movement of the stars and planets across the sky.
As the player looks through the telescope, they can see the event in question, a rare alignment of planets or a comet passing by. The astronomers explain the significance of the event and ask for the player's help in recording data. The player must carefully observe the event and record their findings, which will contribute to the body of knowledge about the cosmos.
"The Greenhouse: A sprawling botanical wonderland, filled with lush greenery and vibrant colors. The greenhouse is a place of tranquility and peace, where the player can escape from the bustle of city life and immerse themselves in the beauty of nature. As you explore the greenhouse, you'll discover an array of rare and exotic plants, each with its unique story and purpose.
At the heart of the greenhouse is the Great Tree, a towering plant that serves as the source of all life within the garden. The Great Tree's roots extend deep into the earth, drawing nourishment from the soil and spreading its life-giving energy throughout the garden. The player may feel a sense of awe and reverence when standing before the Great Tree, sensing its ancient wisdom and power.
The player might also have a chance to participate in the daily rituals of the greenhouse, like watering the plants or harvesting the ripe fruits and vegetables. As they work alongside the gardeners, they'll learn about the delicate balance of nature and the importance of respecting the natural world.
But danger lurks in the shadows of the greenhouse, as an invasive species threatens to overrun the garden and destroy the delicate ecosystem. The player must act quickly to identify the source of the infestation and find a way to eradicate it before it's too late. With the help of the gardeners and their knowledge of the plant world, the player can save the garden from certain destruction and preserve the beauty of nature for generations to come."
Sure! Here are two prompts for Midjourney:
Interior prompt: "From Autumn's residential floor, you look down into The Great Repository - a towering library that houses all the knowledge of the realm of Ether. The building's interior is awe-inspiring, with towering bookshelves lining the walls and the scent of old books filling the air. Light streams in from the building's high, arched windows, casting a golden glow on the books and the desks below. You can see people of all ages and backgrounds studying, reading, and discussing the ideas contained within the books. You are struck by the sense of community and shared purpose that the library inspires."
Exterior prompt: "You stand at the entrance to The Great Repository - a towering structure that houses all the knowledge of the realm of Ether. The building's architecture is imposing, with intricate stonework and soaring columns that reach up towards the sky. The entrance is marked by a massive wooden door, flanked by two marble statues that represent the twin values of knowledge and community. You can see people of all ages and backgrounds streaming in and out of the building, eager to learn and share their ideas. As you look up towards the top of the building, you can just make out Autumn's residential floor - a small reminder that the library's heart beats with the passion and dedication of those who seek to understand the world around them."

Sure, I can describe the amphitheater without using the word itself:
This location is an open-air arena with tiers of seating, a circular stage, and acoustics that make every sound reverberate throughout the space. It is a place where performers from all around Ether come to showcase their talents, ranging from music and dance to spoken word and theater. The stage is often decorated with colorful banners and lights, and the atmosphere is electric with anticipation and excitement as the audience eagerly awaits the next act.
"Midjourney, you've stumbled upon a grandiose circular arena, enclosed by tall walls with a vast open space in the middle. This is a place where people gather for performances, speeches, and grand debates. The amphitheater has a unique ability to unite the people of Ether through the exchange of ideas, culture, and art. Today, a great speaker is set to take the stage, one who will challenge societal norms and offer a new perspective on the importance of community and caring. As you settle into your seat, surrounded by a diverse crowd of people, you feel a sense of unity and belonging. You realize that this is what the people of Ether stand for - a shared vision of a better world, where knowledge, compassion, and love thrive. As the speaker takes the stage, you can't help but feel inspired and empowered, ready to take on the challenges that lie ahead."
The Sanctuary of Life: A place of vibrant greenery and colorful flora, a natural wonderland where the player can escape the chaotic hustle and bustle of city life and immerse themselves in the beauty of nature. As the player explores the sanctuary, they will encounter a variety of rare and exotic plants, each with its own unique story and purpose.
At the center of this sanctuary is a magnificent tree, towering over all other plants, the source of all life within the garden. Its roots stretch deep into the earth, drawing nourishment from the soil and spreading its life-giving energy throughout the garden. The player may feel a sense of wonder and awe when standing before this tree, sensing its ancient wisdom and power.
The player may also have the opportunity to partake in daily rituals of the sanctuary, like watering the plants or harvesting the ripe fruits and vegetables. Alongside the gardeners, they will learn about the delicate balance of nature and the importance of respecting the natural world.
But danger looms in the shadows of the sanctuary as an invasive species threatens to overrun the garden and destroy the delicate ecosystem. The player must act quickly to identify the source of the infestation and find a way to eradicate it before it's too late. With the help of the gardeners and their knowledge of the plant world, the player can save the sanctuary from certain destruction and preserve the beauty of nature for generations to come.
Sure, here's a revised prompt for The Greenhouse without using the word:
"An oasis of life amidst the bustling city, this botanical haven is a treasure trove of exotic plants and vivid colors. The air is thick with the scent of blooming flowers and the rustling of leaves, and the player can find a moment of peace in the serene atmosphere.
The heart of the garden is a towering tree, whose roots run deep into the earth and whose branches reach towards the sky. It is said to be the life force of the garden, a source of vitality and balance that sustains the entire ecosystem. The player can bask in the awe-inspiring presence of the tree, feeling its power and ancient wisdom.
The greenhouse is a place of discovery and learning, where the player can interact with the gardeners and learn about the delicate balance of nature. They can witness the daily rituals of the garden, like the watering of the plants and the harvesting of ripe fruits and vegetables. As they work alongside the gardeners, they'll learn about the importance of respecting the natural world and the interconnectedness of all living things.
But there are threats to the ecosystem that must be addressed. Invasive species threaten the balance of the garden, and the player must use their knowledge and skills to identify and eliminate them before they cause irreparable harm.
By protecting the delicate balance of the garden and preserving the beauty of nature, the player can make a lasting impact on the world and help to create a brighter future for all."
I hope this better aligns with the themes of our game project. Let me know if you have any other prompts you'd like me to revise!
"Ether is a world filled with wonder, where the four seasons are embodied by powerful and unique sisters. The people of Ether value knowledge and community, and their way of life is centered around gathering in communal spaces such as libraries, and gardens. However, the world of Ether is not without its challenges and dangers, and the player must navigate and overcome these obstacles to help the people of Ether thrive."
"The Greenhouse: A magnificent oasis of vibrant greenery and colorful blooms, within the wondrous world of Ether. It's a sanctuary of tranquility where players can escape from the hustle and bustle of the city and immerse themselves in the beauty of nature. They will encounter a diverse range of rare and exotic plants, each with its unique story and purpose.
At the heart of the greenhouse is the legendary Great Tree, the source of all life within the garden. Its towering height and ancient wisdom inspire awe and reverence in all those who stand before it. Players can participate in the daily rituals of the garden, like watering and harvesting, and learn about the delicate balance of nature and the importance of respecting the natural world.
However, danger looms in the shadows of the greenhouse, as an invasive species threatens to overrun the garden and destroy the delicate ecosystem. The player must act quickly to identify the source of the infestation and find a way to eradicate it before it's too late. With the help of the gardeners and their knowledge of the plant world, the player can save the garden from certain destruction and preserve the beauty of nature for generations to come."
The world of Ether is not just a collection of disconnected spaces, but a thriving ecosystem of interconnected places that people can explore and enjoy. The plazas and open social hubs are the heart of the world, bustling with life and energy. These spaces serve as meeting places, markets, and cultural hubs where people can come together to share ideas, trade goods, and celebrate the beauty of life.
As you move from space to space, you'll experience a sense of continuity and connection, as if the entire world is one vast and interconnected organism. Even the corridors and passageways between spaces are alive with activity, bustling with people and energy.
But beyond the immediate surroundings, there's always a sense of something larger at play. The world of Ether is a place of wonder and mystery, where anything is possible, and nothing is quite as it seems. As you explore, you'll be constantly reminded of the vastness of the world around you, the deep interconnectedness of all things, and the infinite potential that lies waiting just beyond the horizon.
The world of Ether is a place of magic and wonder, where the boundaries of reality are blurred and anything is possible. It is a world where the seasons are embodied by powerful beings who have the ability to shape the world around them. Autumn, the caretaker, is responsible for nurturing and caring for all life. She resides in the Great Repository, a sprawling library that houses all the knowledge of the realm.
Summer, the protector, is fierce and unyielding in her defense of the natural world. Spring, the dreamer, is young and full of wonder, always seeking out new experiences and possibilities. Winter, the keeper of secrets, is quiet and reserved, but possesses great knowledge and wisdom.
At the center of it all are Mother Nature and Father Fortune. Mother Nature is the life force of the world, responsible for the growth and flourishing of all things. However, she is also distant, often leaving her children to fend for themselves. Father Fortune, on the other hand, is focused on productivity and efficiency, often at the expense of his relationships with others.
The library economy is a unique system in Ether, where people owe each other pages of text in reading responsibility. The Great Repository, where Autumn lives, is a sprawling library that houses all the knowledge of the realm. It is a place of community and learning, where people come to pursue their interests and expand their horizons.
There are many other locations in Ether as well, such as The Observatory, a tower that houses a powerful telescope and a team of astronomers, is known for its accurate predictions of celestial events. The Greenhouse is a sprawling botanical wonderland, filled with lush greenery and vibrant colors. And the Amphitheater is a grand performance space where people come to watch plays and concerts.
The themes of Ether are many, but they all revolve around a central idea: the importance of community, connection, and knowledge. In Ether, people value their relationships with one another above all else, and they recognize the importance of caring for the natural world that sustains them. Through their pursuit of knowledge and their dedication to their communities, the people of Ether have created a world that is both magical and deeply meaningful.
I did some writing here. Let's see if this helps us: My premise to 'deify' the characters in this game is intentional. We are better able to explore the themes if the characters have inherent expectations of what they are to be to the world. You are Autumn borne of the sister seasons. Set as caretaker of your hearth of the world by your parents, Mother Nature & Father Fortune. You are to learn how to attend to the needs of everyone in your village: see that you are borne to a certain responsibility in giving to them. The game is meant to explore the balance of our interpersonal lives. If we see good theming in the writing: Autumn's three sisters- Winter, Spring, Summer are given to these same expectations by the world. They have resolved to do this differently. Are doing it by their own model: each set to their own course in accepting the responsibility that has been so dearly ascribed: expressed in faith by their parents. (I'm still thinking on how we'd convey 'what the people need' from the sister seasons / and their immensely-tall guardians? Why can she give this thing and not anyone else: why is there any exclusive power?) We might have to ideate on the direction. But to set the stage. You have been endowed this responsibility as Autumn for a long time, catering to everyone's needs. It is easy to do what they ask. It is easy to see that people are taken care of in a day. It would be unfair if they did not have your abilities to see them through the season, would it not? The sister seasons: Winter you would meet first. Our modern cynic. Probably the most relatable character to our general audience. She might be idealized at first, seen as someone to look up to. Does what society asks of her and then sees to her own will for the season. People may have some regard for her. See her utility. Respect her, even demonstrate some semblance of care for her. But they are not so given to community with this person, Winter. She has never seen reason to clasp an outstretched hand; no matter her needs, she resolves "I am alone in this", or scoffs at the attention. "I am fine, you are a bother." Autumn may spend time getting to know her, then find the heart of her ills. She may learn against this practice by how lost Winter seems. Spring gives in abundance. Gives everything she may. To an incredible detriment to others. Players may see joy in this. We would want to be there to support her: the community sees as much value in her. She is kind, she is caring; but Spring, Spring does not know how to ask for herself. May give beyond what she is capable of giving: at a loss to herself and her well-being. It would take moments of conversation and insight to her experiences to understand why she does what she does. People may take advantage. Autumn must be a the older sister. Summer is interesting. She is outwardly joyous. Pleasant, warm: smiles deeply and sincerely. Talks to people with a strange, almost plastered bliss as if she lives for these responsibilities to her village. The second oldest of the four seasons. She is in a strange solitude in this thing. How does Autumn detect this façade? Is it right of her to say? You are expected to be your caretaker for the season. The game will mostly revolve around conversational mechanics, but we can ideate on gameplay. I have another friend I want to talk to about that.
Your writing is a great foundation for exploring the characters and themes in the game. It's clear that the characters are meant to represent certain ideals and values, and their relationships with each other and the world around them are central to the gameplay.
To convey the idea of exclusive power and why Autumn is the only one who can attend to the needs of the people, it may be helpful to explore the idea of specialization. Autumn is specialized in her ability to care for the needs of the people during her season, just as the other seasons have their own specialties. It's not that Autumn is the only one who could do this job, but rather that she has been trained and raised for this specific role.
In terms of gameplay, it may be interesting to have the player take on the role of Autumn and navigate conversations and interactions with the other seasons and the people of the village. Choices made in these interactions could affect the relationships between the characters and the outcome of the game. Additionally, mini-games or puzzles related to the themes of the game could be incorporated to provide variety in gameplay.
'ordained to this role' she had no choice in it. The player may express differently. I wonder how we'd do the narrative branching, but that's sort of a ways away. Until I can figure out ML. This has to be paper design. How do we explore these themes now? A starting premise based on a new character. Or maybe some beginning dialogue from Mother Nature / Father Fortune? How do they express the expectations of the world of Ether to you? You've heard this before. A thousand times. You may almost be reluctant. What is the normal for Autumn if she has been waiting for Summer to resolve her season? How has she spent her time these past 3 months? 
Autumn has been busy attending to the needs of her village, as she is expected to do. She has been making sure that everyone has what they need to survive the season, from warm clothes and shelter to food and firewood. It is a constant cycle of giving, and Autumn has grown accustomed to it over the years.
As for the expectations of the world of Ether, Mother Nature and Father Fortune have made it clear to Autumn since she was young that she is to be the caretaker of her hearth, responsible for ensuring the well-being of everyone in her village. They have told her that it is a great honor to be chosen for this role and that it comes with great responsibility.
At first, Autumn may have felt burdened by this responsibility, but over time, she has come to see it as her duty and has taken great pride in fulfilling it. She knows that without her, the village would not survive, and she takes that responsibility very seriously.
As for a new character to explore these themes, perhaps we could introduce a traveler from another village who has different ideas about what it means to be a caretaker. This traveler could challenge Autumn's beliefs and force her to question whether she is truly happy with her life or if she is just going through the motions.
Alternatively, we could have Autumn encounter one of her sisters who is struggling with their own responsibilities, giving Autumn the opportunity to offer guidance and support while also learning more about her own role in the world of Ether.
Mother Nature: An ethereal figure, enigmatic and ancient, whose every movement echoes throughout the world of Ether. She is the embodiment of the natural world, the mother of all living things, and the guardian of the seasons. Her power is great, her wisdom vast, and her presence awe-inspiring. She speaks in a voice that echoes like the wind through the trees, and her touch is as gentle as the first spring breeze. To encounter her is to experience the very essence of nature.
Father Fortune: A figure of immense wealth and power, whose every word and action carries great weight. He is the embodiment of prosperity and success, the patron of all merchants and traders, and the guardian of the economy. His power is great, his wealth vast, and his presence intimidating. He speaks in a voice that commands attention and respect, and his touch is as firm as a banker's handshake. To encounter him is to experience the very essence of wealth and success.
'life of the party' threw off the prompt for Summer, would you convey her differently? Here are new descriptions for the characters I had forgotten to give you. Father Fortune has to be hardened in his ideals. 'work is our merit, labor is our value' we would not see purpose without it, he says. A sharp contrast to Mother Nature. 'People are our home, people are our hearth' if we would give to the world then they would return to us. Winter has given herself self-ascribed importance. Does not see any relational worth in building relationships with the people in her village. Sees to her responsibilities and then returns to her own time. Where is the flaw in this? She is lost on her own. Does not see any good expression at home. Often has destructive habits we would need to abstract for the audience so that they can project a bit. Spring sees great value in people but does not so recognize her own worth. People may take more than they ought. She may give more than she is able. If Spring is our idealized giver, she is being taken advantage of. Autumn will not so quickly recognize this shortcoming. Summer is difficult. This one is so good, so sincere about her given purpose that she does not falter in it. Like Mother Nature. She will afford the people of her hearth everything they would require. Do it with a 'strongly convincing' smile that puts people at ease. A resting reassurance in her voice that lets people know they will be okay. This is a strange façade. Autumn will have to try exceptionally hard to get past the barrier to deeper conversations with her. Summer is 'always busy' and does not have 'extra time' for her sister when Autumn would push on these related concerns. Summer is deeply depressed but she would not so admit this to anyone. Only continues to work,
Sure, here are new prompts for each of the characters:
Summer: Summer is the lifeblood of her village, always ready to lend a helping hand to anyone in need. Her sincerity and warmth are contagious, and she exudes an air of unwavering confidence and positivity that inspires those around her. But beneath her cheerful exterior lies a deep sense of loneliness and exhaustion, as she struggles to keep up with the demands of her role. How can Autumn reach out to her sister and offer her the support she needs?
Spring: Spring is the embodiment of generosity and kindness, always putting others before herself. She has a boundless well of love to offer, but often forgets to save some for herself. Autumn may see her as an idealized giver, but people may take more than they ought, leaving Spring with little energy to care for herself. Can Autumn help Spring find a balance between giving and receiving?
Winter: Winter is a loner, content with her responsibilities but lost in her own world. She sees no value in building relationships with the people in her village and has destructive habits that she keeps hidden from others. Autumn must work to understand her sister's struggles and help her find her way back to the community that needs her.
Mother Nature: Mother Nature is the nurturing force that holds the world of Ether together. She sees people as the heart and soul of everything, and her love for them is boundless. But her deep empathy can also make her vulnerable to the pain and suffering of others, and she carries the weight of the world on her shoulders. How can Autumn support her mother and remind her that she too needs care and rest?
Father Fortune: Father Fortune believes in the power of hard work and the value of labor. He sees purpose in every task, no matter how small, and holds himself and others to a high standard of productivity. But his rigid ideals can make it difficult for him to connect with others on an emotional level, and he may struggle to see the importance of rest and relaxation. How can Autumn help her father find a balance between work and play, and encourage him to connect with others on a deeper level?
Describe Mother Nature once more, that same prompt. But give her some visage of wisdom in age. Add some level of fantasy, maybe pride to Father Fortune in his prompt. Use the same paragraphs, just slightly alter the wording to improve each of them.
Mother Nature: An ageless and wise being, her presence commands respect and reverence from all who encounter her. She embodies the beauty and power of nature, with long, flowing hair the color of the forest and piercing green eyes that seem to hold the secrets of the world. Her gentle yet firm voice carries the weight of years of experience, and she radiates an aura of calm and tranquility.
Father Fortune: A proud and dignified figure, Father Fortune exudes an air of authority and competence. He embodies the values of hard work and perseverance, with a strong sense of responsibility to his family and community. His stern visage hides a heart of gold, and those who take the time to know him come to appreciate his wisdom and insight. With a deep, booming voice and piercing blue eyes, he commands attention and respect from all who encounter him.
we ought to reduce Father Fortune's generalized age in that prompt. Midjourney is making a generic old man in robes. This man does work, practical but dignified attire. Some nobility in it, but rigor in the design is foremost. Less pride. More competence.
Sure, here's a revised prompt for Father Fortune:
Father Fortune is a practical man, always dressed in dignified attire that reflects his commitment to hard work and perseverance. His clothes are designed for function and durability, with a touch of nobility in the details. He exudes competence and confidence in everything he does, and his bearing commands respect from those around him.
As the patriarch of the family, Father Fortune values the virtues of hard work, persistence, and diligence. He believes that a person's worth is measured by their contribution to society and their ability to provide for themselves and their family. To him, there is no greater calling than to work with one's hands and earn an honest living.
Despite his seriousness and focus on practical matters, Father Fortune has a kind heart and is always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need. He has a deep love for his family and community and strives to provide for them in every way he can.
Let us see a re-combination of this prompts. "Father Fortune is a practical man, always dressed in dignified attire that reflects his commitment to hard work and perseverance. His clothes are designed for function and durability, with a touch of nobility in the details. He exudes competence and confidence in everything he does, and his bearing commands respect from those around him. As the patriarch of the family, Father Fortune values the virtues of hard work, persistence, and diligence. He believes that a person's worth is measured by their contribution to society and their ability to provide for themselves and their family. To him, there is no greater calling than to work with one's hands and earn an honest living. Despite his seriousness and focus on practical matters, Father Fortune has a kind heart and is always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need. He has a deep love for his family and community and strives to provide for them in every way he can." and "A proud and dignified figure, Father Fortune exudes an air of authority and competence. He embodies the values of hard work and perseverance, with a strong sense of responsibility to his family and community. His stern visage hides a heart of gold, and those who take the time to know him come to appreciate his wisdom and insight. With a deep, booming voice and piercing blue eyes, he commands attention and respect from all who encounter him." We need to be some where in the middle.
Let me try to merge the two prompts together:
Father Fortune is a practical man who values hard work and perseverance above all else. He dresses in dignified attire that reflects his commitment to function and durability, with a touch of nobility in the details. His bearing exudes competence and confidence, commanding respect from those around him. As the patriarch of the family, Father Fortune believes that a person's worth is measured by their contribution to society and their ability to provide for themselves and their family. He takes great pride in his ability to work with his hands and earn an honest living, but also recognizes the importance of compassion and kindness. Despite his stern visage, Father Fortune has a heart of gold and is always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need. He deeply loves his family and community, and strives to provide for them in every way he can.
Would you please give me a more relatable description of Mother Nature? Autumn looks up to her, so do her sisters. She has a mutual regard for Father Fortune.
Sure, here's a revised prompt for Mother Nature:
"Mother Nature is a warm and nurturing presence, with a deep love and respect for all living things. Her clothes are simple and practical, designed for comfort and ease of movement as she tends to the needs of her beloved children - the plants, animals, and people of the world. She exudes a sense of calm and wisdom, and her kind eyes radiate an inner beauty and grace that draws people to her. Autumn and her sisters look up to her as a role model, and her mutual regard for Father Fortune is evident in the balance and harmony they have achieved together. Despite the challenges and hardships that come with caring for the world, Mother Nature remains steadfast in her love and devotion to all those under her care."
I loved your original descriptions of the both of them. Please do not lose value in these words: "Mother Nature is the nurturing force that holds the world of Ether together. She sees people as the heart and soul of everything, and her love for them is boundless. But her deep empathy can also make her vulnerable to the pain and suffering of others, and she carries the weight of the world on her shoulders. How can Autumn support her mother and remind her that she too needs care and rest?" "Father Fortune believes in the power of hard work and the value of labor. He sees purpose in every task, no matter how small, and holds himself and others to a high standard of productivity. But his rigid ideals can make it difficult for him to connect with others on an emotional level, and he may struggle to see the importance of rest and relaxation. How can Autumn help her father find a balance between work and play, and encourage him to connect with others on a deeper level?"
Certainly, here are revised descriptions of both Mother Nature and Father Fortune that are more relatable:
"Mother Nature is the heart and soul of the world of Ether. She sees people as the core of everything, and her love for them is boundless. Her deep empathy can make her vulnerable to the pain and suffering of others, but she remains steadfast in her commitment to nurturing the world and its inhabitants. Autumn looks up to her mother, and her sisters also hold her in high regard. But as the caretaker of the world, Mother Nature can sometimes forget to take care of herself. Autumn must remind her mother that self-care is important, and that she too needs rest and rejuvenation."
"Father Fortune is a hardworking and practical man who values the power of labor and perseverance. He sees purpose in every task and strives to hold himself and others to a high standard of productivity. His strong work ethic can be inspiring, but his rigid ideals can sometimes make it difficult for him to connect with others on an emotional level. Despite this, Father Fortune loves his family and community deeply, and will do anything to provide for them. Autumn may struggle to connect with her father, but through patience and understanding, she can help him find a balance between work and play, and encourage him to connect with others on a deeper level.

Here are a few ideas for how we could connect the themes in this game to real-world issues:

Caregiving/Self-Care Balance: The tension between caring for others and caring for oneself could connect to issues like caregiver burnout, the mental load of domestic work, and setting healthy boundaries. Research on these topics could inform the game's exploration of caregiving dynamics.

Societal Expectations: The ideals and expectations placed on the seasons by Mother Nature and Father Fortune could be a metaphor for gender roles, family responsibilities, or cultural norms in society. The game could examine how these expectations shape identity and behavior.

Social Support Systems: The relationships and community connections between the seasons highlights the importance of social support for wellbeing. This ties into research on the health benefits of strong social ties.

Work-Life Balance: Father Fortune's focus on productivity at the expense of relaxation and relationships mirrors issues of work-life balance and overwork faced today. Autumn could help him find a middle ground.

Climate Change: The seasons' vital role in the world's ecosystem connects loosely to environmental activism and humanity's impact on nature. Responsible stewardship of the natural world is relevant.

Interpersonal Communication: The enact dialogue system emphasizes nonviolent communication, empathy, and understanding between characters. This ties into conflict resolution research and psychology.

Overall, positioning the characters and narrative as allegories for modern systemic issues could create interesting parallels that enrich the game's themes and social commentary. Let me know if you have any other specific connections in mind!

Would you please elaborate on some modern systemic issues related to the theming? How can the theming be improved to better reflect real-world issues? If you were to re-write the synopsis in a way that was more nuanced?
CC

Here are some ways I could elaborate on the themes and connect them to modern systemic issues:

Caregiving/Self-Care Balance: The tension Autumn feels between caring for her village and caring for herself mirrors the struggles many caregivers face today. Heavy caregiving demands can lead to burnout, depression, and health issues. Autumn's journey could represent learning to set boundaries and accept help so she can care for others in a sustainable way.

Societal Expectations: The high expectations placed on Autumn and her sisters reflect the gendered social pressures and stereotypes women face regarding caregiving and emotional labor. The story could explore how they push back against traditional gender roles and redefine their purpose on their own terms.

Social Support Systems: Autumn's relationships with her sisters represent how social support and community connections are vital for mental health and resilience. Her efforts to bring her isolated sisters together highlights the importance of mutual aid.

Work-Life Balance: Father Fortune and Mother Nature's conflicting ideals symbolize the work-life clash faced by many today. Autumn could help them balance their demanding roles with rest, joy, and family bonds.

Environmental Harmony: The changing seasons and forces of nature represent humanity's impact on the environment. The "chaos" threatening Ether's balance can be seen as climate change. Restoring harmony requires mindful stewardship.

Communication and Empathy: The enact system emphasizes nonviolent communication, deep listening, and seeing from others' perspectives. Mastering this empathetic communication could help resolve conflicts between characters.

Rather than framing societal expectations as rigid but inevitable facts of life, the story could position them as constructs to be examined and reinvented. And rather than seeing systemic issues as isolated problems for individuals to solve alone, it could highlight the need for collective action and social support. Let me know if you would like me to re-write the synopsis with a more nuanced, real-world aligned approach!

Give it a go, if you would. I appreciate your ideas on this.
CC

Here is a revised synopsis for the game that tries to incorporate a more nuanced, realistic portrayal of the themes:

You play as Autumn, one of four sisters bound by societal expectations to dutifully maintain the seasons. For years, you've sacrificed your own needs to provide for your village without complaint. But the endless work has left you exhausted and isolated.

When the seasonal cycles begin to destabilize, you reluctantly embark on a journey to restore balance. Along the way, you encounter your sisters- Winter, aloof and overworked; Spring, taken for granted despite her devotion; Summer, mysteriously vanished.

Together, you discover the breakdown is linked to humanity's exploitation of nature, as well as your own lack of fulfillment. While your divine parents demand you stay the course, you realize pursuing your own purpose could help heal both the world's discord and your family's.

Using a new form of empathetic communication, you resolve long-standing conflicts with your sisters. Through opening up about your struggles with burnout, setting boundaries, and admitting your need for help, you inspire them to reinvent vocation on their own terms.

The game explores themes like societal expectations, women's roles, work-life balance, , and finding purpose. But it emphasizes collective action over individual responsibility. Only by joining together, listening deeply, and challenging ingrained assumptions can we address systemic issues at their roots and bring balance to our interconnected world.

Let me know if this revised synopsis better captures the nuanced approach we discussed! I'm happy to clarify or expand on any part.

I need more details. You did a wonderful job, but it still feels hamfisted. Let's forget about literal humanity and the reality of climate change in this. The story is slightly abstracted with non-human characters. The sister seasons, mother nature, and father fortune are the only human-like people in this world and that's only to make the game more relatable. Why are the sister seasons set to take care of the world's inhabitants? (why are women ordained the role of caretakers?) People ought to know how to take care of each other, but we are so atomized and isolated, we see our own problems as far greater than the worries of woes of others. The people of Ether are not children, but nor are modern, real-world adults. How can the sister seasons shift expectations away from 'the myth of the individual' and help people to see that they are powerful on their own-but together to affect their own lives in a meaningful way? We need not rely on governance or greater powers to direct us. We may organize, find solidarity, realize our own potential without external forces directing us. Mother Nature and Father Fortune are so-real but they are not truly capable of moving us towards a better future. Their ideals alone will not realign us to community. (appeals to authority, nature, a reluctance to try because we feel we are powerless, and a deeply ingrained bootstrapping mentality.)

You raise excellent points - let me try to add more nuance and detail:

The sister seasons are ordained as caretakers due to long-standing societal norms and stories that position women/femininity as naturally nurturing and obligated to serve others. However, the seasons grow dissatisfied with these limiting roles over time.

The inhabitants of Ether have fallen into disconnection and apathy, taking the seasons' dedication for granted. They've internalized ideals of radical self-reliance and see the seasons more as divine servants than fellow community members.

Through their journey, the seasons realize they must help the people become active participants in their own society. They encourage them to identify and share their skills, collaborate, and see themselves as interdependent rather than independent.

The seasons model vulnerability and interdependence - admitting they cannot do everything alone. They highlight how giving and receiving can be circular - how even the strongest need support sometimes.

Rather than direct others, they inspire change through dialogue and their own evolving examples. They turn seasonal rituals into opportunities for connection. Gradually, the people are energized and step up to aid each other.

Together, they design new traditions that distribute responsibility more evenly. The seasons share wisdom but emphasize the people already have the tools within themselves and their community. They just need the passion and conviction to see themselves as agents of change.

In the end, the seasons transform perceptions - of gender roles, individualism, authority. Their world is realigned to shared purpose and mutual care through the power of human cooperation and the questioning of ingrained beliefs - not divine intervention.

World and Story Summary

The game takes place in an abstracted world brought to life through the four sister seasons who maintain the natural order. Each season is personified as a character imbued with unique abilities and struggles.

For generations, the seasons have dutifully cared for the land and its inhabitants, ordained to these roles based on limiting societal traditions. However, as time passes, the growing isolation and thankless dedication begins to take its toll.

When the seasonal cycles start to destabilize, portending disastrous consequences, the seasons are spurred onto individual journeys of self-discovery. Along the way, they learn of each other's discontent and begin to question the meaning behind their sacrificial roles.

Joining together, the sister seasons journey across the land, encountering inhabitants who take their gifts for granted. As the seasons share their grievances and challenges, it becomes clear the instability stems from a loss of equilibrium - both within the land's ecosystem and their own psyches.

Through opening up about burnout, lack of fulfillment, and desire for change, the seasons come to reconsider their purpose and place in the world. They realize they must transform outdated traditions and inspire the inhabitants to take active responsibility for their home and community.

By shifting seasonal rituals to be more collaborative and forging new connections, equilibrium and interdependence are restored. The seasons find renewed purpose in nurturing the land and inhabitants from a place of authenticity and balance. Their world is realigned through cooperation and growth, not divine intervention.

Themes

	Examining and challenging traditional gender roles and societal expectations
	Achieving work-life balance, setting healthy boundaries
	Fostering human connection and community engagement
	Questioning norms of individualism and self-reliance
	Encouraging vulnerability, interdependence, and mutual support
	Finding purpose and meaning through self-discovery and transformation
	Promoting collective action to create social change

Reference texts

Ecology of Western Forests', "Don't Always Hike Sit Still: A human is a large, conspicuous animal, and few of us go undetected as we make our way through a forest. By choosing a comfortable and interesting location in which to sit quietly and observe, we can often see more than by constantly moving. This is the best way to really begin to hear as well as see nature. You'll be much more aware of the sounds of the forest when you are still and quiet. Most experienced naturalists have had many memorable encounters with wildlife by sitting quietly and waiting to see what shows up."

"The physical patterns of nature are worth emulating in the garden because they trap energy. Inventive use of three-dimensional space, time-niches, and good inter-relationships are what we are looking for here. Old thinking can blind us to easy productive solutions, but creative patterns of thinking can be learned and replayed for human benefit-the gardener's not least of all."

“Being lighthearted is not the same as being lightweight”

"The failings of human nature are universal, and therefore our forgiveness for them should be universal as well."

"Some people should be woken up with just a nudge, not a blow, and in the same way, some people's good-faith sense of gratitude is not dead, just to asleep. Let's wake it up."


"Only by accepting ingratitude can we continue to be generous. We must never allow our disappointment in those who receive to stop us from giving."

Moomin, Wind in the Willows, Peter Rabbit-type of tone


In book 4 of On Benefits, Seneca moves to the moral heart of the topic, the relationship between human generosity and the beneficence of the gods. As a Stoic, Seneca subscribed to the view that the gods—not conceived primarily as Jupiter and his family, but as diffuse, amorphous beings or a single collective being (see 4.7)—are entirely benevolent, to the extent (not a very great one) they even care about human life. They are the forces that first set the cosmos in order and continue to keep it running smoothly. Because the world they have established holds many boons for humankind, Seneca regards them as models of selfless giving. This view is partly based on his dismissal (see 4.25) of the traditional notion that the gods delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices.

[4.1] Out of all the things we've taken up, [...], nothing can be thought more essential or more needful of careful expression than what is now before us: the question of whether giving a boon, and returning a favor in turn, should be pursued simply for its own sake. [...] We must go toward her by treading expedience underfoot, and go wherever she calls or sends us, without looking to our own household, without any sparing of our blood; her power must never be disparaged. "What will I get then," you say, "if I do this bravely and graciously?" Only this: the fact that you did it. Nothing else is promised to you.

[4.3.2] It's not a gift or good deed if it looks toward an increase of fortune. Besides, if only expedience prompted us to help others, then those who can most easily do so would give least of all—the wealthy, the powerful, the monarchs, those who don't need help from others. Not even the gods would bestow so many gifts, which in fact they heap on us day and night without ceasing. For their own nature suffices for all their needs, and renders them complete, and safe, beyond all harm. They will give nothing good to anyone, if the only reason for giving is to look out for oneself and one's advantage. To look not for where you can best place your boon, but where you will get the most profit from it, and where you will most easily reap the reward—this is not giving, but investing.

[4.4.3] Who is so wretched and cast down, who so accursed by fate and born for trouble, as not to perceive the greatness of the generosity of the gods? Look around at those whiners who are always bemoaning their fortunes, and still you won't find a one who has no share of heaven's benefactions, no one who has not been touched by a drop from that kindliest of springs. Was it too little, then—that which was parceled out to us at birth on an equal basis? Never mind the goods that were later divided in uneven measure. Did Nature give too little when she gave us herself?


Development advice

As soon as a game is 'announced', people will begin to form ideas of what it might be like. To be best conveyed to people, we must not 'talk past' the most-realized scope. [I see the trap developers tend to fall into. Seeing that you demonstrate the game while it's being built is important to give it momentum when you launch. Designing a good experiences goes with incredible complexity and you can't always predict might not survive the full length of production]. Genre conventions will say a wealth about how players think a thing is meant to play; then also says what devs think its meant to be. We don't have to stick to every convention in design but we must see to it that ⁠Unknown fits in to a well-reasoned genre players would easily identify with. Players tend not to wander outside of their comfort zones and will stick to whatever games type they most-recognize and find reliable play in.

Launching a game, you may be given a title sequence, some cinematic to further ground your beliefs [knowings] of what a game will turn out to be like. The main menu [may] affect your still-developing ideas of what it is you'll be playing, too. Ideally, the front-loaded trailers, screenshots; all else you've heard about a thing will somewhat prepare you for the experience. Expectations come from this idea of game's shared genres, as well.




Themes of the games


We should seek to create a wanting in the player for the time of characters; removed from any puzzles or their gamified drivers, we should design and write to give the player opportunities to see that these characters, these people will also want to spend time for themselves and others.

The player must likewise be afforded a feeling that they are allowed moments for themselves, too. Give the player opportunities to ask time of people; they may find drives of interest to the person. Characters may ask often of the player.  Both the characters and the player have autonomy to reject or accept said asks. Opportunities to make progression alone exist but [will] come with disheartening difficulties, not more challenge. Obstacles that you confront alone will be so much more demanding of your thought.

Social and thus mechanical complexity will arise when we are contending character goals against that of the player character. Players will be weighing the value of character choices along the journey. Your friends may part ways: you may decide on a journey to take. The curiosities here, the wonders, my ideation here may be out of scope. In knowledge of the game being free and open for traversal, no reason you could not turn back to greet old friends when you are farther along in this journey. The intensity here is that I feel the need to be there now. Do things now, every time I choose this thing over them, every time I cannot explain what I do, they lose hope, they lose an imagination of my value. 

Contrasting player and character goals. Complexity will come when we begin to weigh the character goals against the given asks of the player and vice versa. 

Further complexity will come when we want to weigh character goals against the given asks of the player. So, mayhaps more to consider and build off of from, but we'll have to say what affects their feeling of relation to the player and let the characters balance their own needs/wants against the need s/wants of the player and others. Every person should seek an equilibrium in how much they are willing to give/want to receive.

We can write fables in the context of grounded characters; reflected in a way that is mirrored to the disillusion and trauma in our modern society. The many most-pressing issues of today are problems we have yet to fully discern. ⁠Unknown should help. If folk tales were meant to teach, books are meant to share knowledge; media can  does not require you to be present for it, I think the interesting thing of games is that they necessitate engagement in ways that other forms of content could not. The thing of 'edutainment' is not what I mean. We can so do better with good design principles.

On the design for sake of education: teaching in what we write into the text. The meaning characters might convey. What they say reasons out their choices in this life. These things may help us reflect, too.


Character outlining

In the named thing of parentage and how we inherently owe ourselves to our children. If Mother Nature owes herself to all; notwithstandingthe rightful will to herself; then to see that Mother would not be able to give herself for the Autumn's ills. She goes to greater concern of those others in greater need.

Not in neglect; or even ignorance; but so-other responsibilities.
spoiler: I see now; the Mother's greatest, all-but known flaw

If there are family ties, Father [...] Mother [let's call her]. In the great fables, see that one may regard father as in a fair likeness to that of a preacher. He would speak to all that would need him. Father time may have relation to this thing of knowledge among all people. - father time is tied to ‘knowledge’

‘what is right: what I ought to: what is ‘just’: what is fair’

mother nature: what is needed: expected:
feels good to give one to one’s own cause

This unknowable thing of Fortune: 
Tie in another character. That of Fortune. If the imagined wills of old gods could speak to us in what we wrote and prayed for the thing of Fortune is the thing of gratitude and return; to all those physical wants of things and our 'given' wealths false-gold  Fortune is unknown to all of us, but gifted none the less. Those that live here may pray to 'Fortune's giving'.



Some overblown writing

Humanity was once a species of great oration. We once carried spoken tales over generations and kept them alive way of our incredible linguistic abilities and collective knowledge. To say on what we knew was intuitive. The thing of knowing comes easy to us. Saying-so is much more difficult today than it used to be. Of anxieties and not 'sure what to 'think' or imagine ourselves doing. We may rather talk on politics, on-goings, or these wonderous fictions; may be say on our greatest worries. All not to speak on what this thing of life really is for us. — 



Needs some amendment

We know ourselves so well, we may see ourselves even better; the thing of self-reflection is that it takes so much of our reserve, but it is done automatically if we do not take time to distract ourselves. The mind will just go on to bring things up and have us reflect. If not in our dreams, then in the way we would talk to others or (still, rather) talk to ourselves. This thing of soliloquy has been mentioned so many times before but its this inhibited behavior that speaks so much to what we really are as a species. Our language gives us such incredible allowances for expression but these things of our inherited lives would keep us from our best system of 'knowledge conclusion' outside of the things we would make or do. To 'say so' to ourselves or to another is to reconcile it; to truly hear on it. 

- Language and reconciliation

We see sins in the way of greed in the way of jealousy; why do we then so often see ourselves to the thing of wealth? If our value to the dollar vanished, and all of these holdings of wealth disappeared overnight; would we not see to the matter that others are well? — If the modern person would rather disparage on their lost accounts before seeing that others are good, we would then not hold people to our most value."

- Ways of want and wealth

What should we ought to live for? What would the people of this fiction in ⁠Unknown live for if they had not the concept of money, 'savings'; the thing of wealth for one's own Fortune and future. Say they live for themselves and other people. Simply put. To write well for the game, the culture we shape for these themes should relate well to our real lives; lets say that things would occupy-people to a feeling of disinterest or detachment. What are the greater needs of those residing here?

- What then, if not for money?


World building detail

If we want to create a science fiction game where characters can move around easily on a planet with 100 times the size of Earth, we could assume a lower density for the planet, which would result in lower surface gravity.

Assuming the planet has a density of 1 g/cm^3 (similar to the density of water), its mass can be calculated as follows:

Mass = Density x Volume

Volume = (4/3) x pi x radius^3

Radius = 1.45e+07/2 = 7.25e+06 meters

Volume = (4/3) x 3.14159 x (7.25e+06)^3 = 1.305 x 10^21 cubic meters

Mass = 1 g/cm^3 x 1.305 x 10^21 cm^3 = 1.305 x 10^24 kg

The surface gravity on this planet can be calculated using the same formula as before:

Acceleration due to gravity = G x (Mass of the planet) / (Radius of the planet)^2 Acceleration due to gravity = (6.67430 x 10^-11) x (1.305 x 10^24) / (7.25e+06)^2

Acceleration due to gravity = 1.36 m/s^2

This is approximately 0.14 times the acceleration due to gravity on Earth (9.81 m/s^2), which would make movement much easier for characters with a large mass or heavy machinery.

Note that a planet with a density this low is not realistic, but it could be used in a science fiction game to create a unique and fun environment for players.


Humanity is nigh but a roving tribe of orators- knowledge bearers and storytellers. Language is by far our greatest gift.  —Righted, we ought to recognize the shared value in our voices.



Goals goals, lofty goals. I speak on these incredible ideals, I see how to act on them, but I would not have the resources, knowledge, egress or wit to enact them in my life. These writings may only help me explore the potentialities, not so critically explain what it is I mean to build. No text would do it all at once, but I will so try with this one. If I am meant to do anything, I would like to bring people together, we have left ourselves with incredible scars that will take cultural revolution to shift. We have to see ourselves all at once and stop the gain to consume more and have more and ‘’feel’’ more. This strange satisfaction is not us. It is this that the buddha was trying to teach. To reflect in the mirror to find we have no vision of the self. If the wide would abide we may see ourselves to perfect text. 



dodec is meant to be the teacher of how we might build our spaces: share what we have as you would share a library. alignment in this way is not so difficult to imagine.

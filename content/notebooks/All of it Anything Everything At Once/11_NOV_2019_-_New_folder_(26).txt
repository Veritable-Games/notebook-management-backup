====== REC001.txt ======
You know there's a little chip bag clamps, I think when I get a bunch of those, tack them on the
post, tack them on the post here, and then hang the blanket, and then within you can use
tape to your tape to blanket to the wood, to further insulate it, because he rises.
Now when you keep it all light in his face, it's like, well, not necessarily
mere one, but it's a hot box.


====== REC002.txt ======
Conversational Thug of War.


====== REC003.txt ======
Dialogue should be representative of someone's intent, someone's expression.
Writing should drive narrative action.


====== REC005.txt ======
are discord's logs cataloged on the computer or on a server. Can I go back
history and save reference logs or idea logs or channel logs or whatever. Idea.


====== REC006.txt ======
What if you save an animation cost?
You 3D printed a puppet that had points of tracking on it.
That would be an interesting way to create keyframes.
One more dynamic, one more intuitive.
You can just take a photo of it really.
Parts for us making it a trickle-it.
You might want to get a sideshow-collectible figurine with a puzzle of fingers or replaceable hands.
Hmm.
Yeah, it's fucking extraordinary.


====== REC007.txt ======
The diamond takeer he should dissipate in a close space.


====== REC008.txt ======
That is to say, the idea already is of a given social space, with minimal insulation
and an extreme insulation like trees and stuff, that's the insulation shield to keep
heat within a space, and then you have people, and to keep the space insulated you had to
bring people close together. It's just a practical design, so you take the median temperature
of the overall planet, you know, it's negative 50 degrees, or it's really good, it's
negative 60 degrees Celsius. No, I have to warn that, I'll figure out the number later.
Anyway, you have the outside air being colder than the inside air, and the inside air is warming
up to two bodies being active, the trees and the people, and whatever gets too cold, the
Dodeck hatch, to warm the space further, the player characters navigate through the space,
and they're using a mirror's edge, a mirror's edge, and a true mirror like navigation system,
so the player is reaching out and grappling, but in grappling, that exerted heat is exaggerated
because it's a machine, it's dense, it's a powerful mechanism, and it jumps further,
it's a typical human piece of a lot, and the arm is like a grappling maneuver, and you're
grappling in from one point to another, it's like it's a good entertaining way, but it's not too
exaggerated, it's slightly exaggerated, so it's like a huge jump, 30% farther than
when you would otherwise, and that extra boost is the fun bit, it's like years of war
active reload system, you jump, you jump again, you jump again, and it's like you're doing
the, you go to time it, you jump, imagine like your character jumps up, imagine
that there's two, two adjacent planes, you've got to jump further, but it's below you,
so you've got to jump in between the arc, so like you, on the top one, you jump out, you
work down, you've got to go further, so you boost yourself a little bit, and now you're on
the other platform, below it, so imagine that you're climbing up or climbing around,
or climbing between, you know, parallel to, or with the running and the jumping and
the boosting between jumps and climbs, so like you do that too, and that's how you
make an interesting and engaging climbing system, but then here's the catch,
it goes further, imagine you have these, these legs, these arms, they're grappling
out, but you can also use them for conversation, the body can be used to express,
and when you're not climbing, you're not running, you're not, you know, maneuvering,
mode when you're talking to people, when you're engaged with a topic with someone,
that's when your character starts to express, they can use the symbols of the
Dodeck to communicate, that's another tangent for later, but anyway, as you jump
up a heat, heat exertion, and imagine your character won't be able to move
very much, because there he is, they don't sweat like humans, but they can,
and that can be done through steam exertion, so the machine builds a
heat, and then it exerts steam, as it builds up, or when it gets really high,
but you need more water to produce more steam, to lower the overall temperature,
so when you reach the bond fire, so to speak, up this metric running on like path,
pathing system, you need to find water sources to neutralize
a little faster, neutralize your overall temperature faster, it takes a while,
it takes a little bit, you know, it's not, it's a passive mechanic,
heat the player kind of, localized for a little bit, that's like two or three
minutes, maybe a minute and thirty seconds, you know, anyway,
it's enough to help the player engage, they can see you coming,
coming down, they can rest, to cool down faster, and sit down,
and then, you know, now instead of a minute thirty seconds,
it's like forty-five, fifty seconds, or they can go find a water source,
fill up their canteen and drink, or just smash their head in the water,
and drink that way, or whatever, I don't know.
It could be a little more animalistic, like a cat or a dog,
or a human before they had the tools, and then they're given the players,
given the tool to drink later on by someone that was kind enough.
Okay, you want to hand this to the canteen?
I don't know, to get the can, they can't be given the canteen to begin with.
Uh, that's, yeah, that's better.
That way it's like they know where they have to drink water.
Hey?
Okay, have fun out there.
Take your time.
Don't forget to drink water.
Hey, take your time exploring.
Uh, hey, don't, don't forget to drink water.
I need it.
Don't forget to hydrate.
Is what she says.
Because prior to this, the player had known in this mechanic
because the robot, uh,
threw up a form.
The basic form was running around and walking.
And that form is, uh,
it overheats with the legs.
It can't climb, but it can navigate.
So this, that they are the Dota character,
that secondary form isn't more,
it means a means of more interesting navigation.
So if you're agree, you go on.
Oh boy.
Okay, I gotta take care of the end of the sign document.

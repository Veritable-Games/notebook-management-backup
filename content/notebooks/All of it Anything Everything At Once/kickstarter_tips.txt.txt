====== kickstarter tips.txt ======
	Don't announce that you want to work with fans. too much stress. accept general advice or feedback, but don't let them drive any aspect of the project
	don't promise any ambitious features or any concrete release dates
	add a beta tier for backers. limit it to an amount that you can handle. try not to cater to them too much. feature creep is a danger.
	consider adding cut features or features that don't fit as easter eggs sometime down the road
	Humble Store, GOG, Steam
	(Windows, Linux, Mac)
	If the kickstarter campaign makes more than we anticipated, don't scale the scope to match. that's how developers bite off more than they can chew and the game dies.

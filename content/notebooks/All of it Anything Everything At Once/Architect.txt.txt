====== Architect.txt ======
The humans are not able to control the city's Architect, and weren't able to reprogram it's subordinates for combat. They can't control these forces without the city's integrated communication systems, so the creation of a new AI isn't possible. 

communicate with electrical impulses to convey messages and coordinate instructions, relaying them through a designated controller.
 
The Architect's nanites are designed like an immune system and will fend off competing variants. If humanity is able to create an AI more sophisticated than the one in place (or a powerful foreign nanite is introduced) they could potentially wipe out the old Architect's functions and assume control of the city. Quickly repopulating it with the dominant AI. Nanites can adapt over successive attacks, but this change makes them harder for other cities to recognize. (code isn't synced between core AI) Those mutations set them apart from one another over time until they become incompatible with one another. The inhabitants' survival is dependant on the AI's ability to adapt to environments and coded attacks. (very much like how natural selection operates)

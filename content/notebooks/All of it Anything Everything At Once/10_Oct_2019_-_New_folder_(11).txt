Hello, hello
Making a note

====== REC009.txt ======
So I don't think I saved it properly, I'm going to say it, but I think it can at least express this one idea.
So, socialization is the missing human form of expression in our language.
So, art, philosophy, science, there's forms of expression, forms of human experience,
meaning, I suppose, and I think that we disregard socialization as being less significant,
but it is as just as a significant art form as not art form.
It's a means of expression.
Socialization is part of human behavior and pure culture, it is a ability to articulate oneself
is one of the most highly reverted traits, and we don't recognize that in our society.
I think we need to change that with a direct system, with the 12 faces and the multiple science
and I'm going to use this game as a means to articulate this idea.


====== REC010.txt ======
When you're trying to raise it down with him, when you're trying to rationalize him, when you're trying to find an agreement, you'll get in your heart and then you're getting to a nut of it, you just stop talking, and you just talk, and you expect some of the lies.
It says that you have a chance and okay, and then you text him, and he's like, I don't want to do more things.
He's like, I feel like I still don't know.
You're not going to tell him, you know, I don't want to tell him, but there has been things where I told him, you know, I mean, he's not upset at me, he's still talking, he just keeps talking.
I mean, I have to.
When he's there, he makes me like 40% of it.
We feel that, but I feel very awkward in that, because we could have been having his eyes.
Does someone like, does my partner?
The thing is, we're not funny.
But he's expressing himself in a way that, that's how he feels, he's joking around with it, but that's how he genuinely internally feels.
He wants to spend more time with him, there's something like that.
Yeah, but we don't have much time to do that, it's a problem.
Because I've been putting everything off like, I could have got my license, but now I just wait and got it.
Because it's not, because I don't go on the weekends, home, I go looking at my grades.
And then that's another week that I don't go, do it.
And then another week I don't go, do it, I still haven't done it.
Despite the fact that I have a weekend when he was at his mom's and I couldn't have done it, and instead I needed a cleaning house.
So that's one of those things that I just put everything off for so long that when I try to do it, I can't do all this stuff I need to do.
I don't need it after such a long time.
I don't know how to do that again.
What?
Haven't we been together for a long time?
No, it's a long time.
It's a long way to go, it's a long way to go.
More time to get used to it.
Don't you think?
How do you get used to it?
Oops.

Reminder to dumbass sound
Make this button here the one you're looking at the one that does the record on record off into the red button
Because I pressed this one
I missed that first row there. I got a lot of time here
Yeah, for sure this one because I can't be a ticket that idea
For June
Could you read it? Could you read your ticket? It's an aspect of that. Your personal feeling now
I need more extract
More no more in your ticket aid, I guess
Of thinking on ten or nine. Oh, because you have you know, let me try to paint your picture actually
We'll go back in the water and check from the phone
Yes, you're doing part of it. I'm so excited
You
So
I was pretty sure you added it to me when I was walking out the door and it's fine, it's
fine, but I don't think I'm going to let that go, I'm not going to let it go, I think that's
fine, and if I did end up leaving it out there, I think it's my personal hypothesis that they
would be kind enough to give back to me, because that's how most humans operate. No one acts with
malattent in mind. He's not going to let it go. Oh, I've got it.
Why is it punching? That will do.

====== REC012.txt ======
But, um, what I was saying with that, like, most video games have the characters, have
all kinds of sick, I touched my hand, um, I almost did at all.
I did that earlier, I don't know how to put it on there, I just, you know, it's slated
but I think we really touched it, it's the actual, you know, it should be in the game.
Yeah, I don't know.
I just don't want to be in the game.
Yeah.
Um.
Hmm.
It's gotta be in the game.
Uh-huh.
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
That's what we pretty good about talking in this game.
Yeah.
You gotta do it.
I don't know.
Are you gonna put a pie on my yours?
It's yours, it's yours.
It's yours, it's yours.
Oh, pretty much.
So this is, like, I'm gonna have a walk down some drive.
I'm not expecting that.
You know?
But, um, do you get on the game?
Do you get on the game?
We have, like, characters that have one expression every time you go see them.
Yeah, they're like, they'll move along.
They'll jump a little bit.
Yeah, they'll have a smile.
Right, but the arms are never represented in what they're saying.
They're not using the hand to express.
They're using it just to, I am moving.
I remember you see, you look to be moving.
Yeah, they'll have a friend of mine.
Yeah.
They know random vegetables from conversation.
That's, that's, that's, that's so counter-intuitive language.
Cause I'm gonna say Skyrim has a function where they talk
about their body like this when we come up to them.
I can't, it's like that.
But they'll move back to the basic, they just stand there for a minute,
and then it repeats that one motion.
I have a beautiful idea here.
Okay, I know.
You're gonna like this.
So imagine, you know, sign language, right?
Make a sign language.
That's used to express oneself.
Yeah.
Okay, it's used to, it's used in a traditional means of language.
What if instead, and what if there was an addition to this,
which I'm just sign language in general?
I mean, technically isn't repre-eating.
It's more like a, what if using American sign language
just sign certain expressions, right?
But because it has that background, because it has that,
that initial, what do you call it?
It's, that's, we can start with scratch.
We can use symbols to express language.
It's just very difficult for us to use these existing terminologies
because they come in some of the baggage.
I think that also applies to sign language.
So what if you use the actual symbols?
You use the dotac symbols.
The ones on there, the dotac hatred.
The, the structure that I showed you.
Yeah, anger and anxiety and aggression.
Anger and aggression, anger and aggression is the same anxiety
and, uh, fear are the same.
There's also a middle one, who is, what was it?
There was anxiety.
Fear and...
There's anxiety and fear and strictly.
So you kinda want the same thing.
I don't fancy style and say how it works.
Or more like chat room gaming style.
Where they have basic stuff, circle.
That says you can show the emotion, it's sad.
Um, so kind of like that.
That'll be in the lunch screen stuff.
That'll be in the, the, the sub menu, I suppose.
Um, we're unlocking stuff.
There's a bit, bits of pieces of understanding the world.
Going forward in the mind almost.
There's a bit of an optional thing, fear, character, out the NPC.
It's supposed to be on that similar expression.
It's not like this thing.
So you use this machine train.
And they're bipeds.
They're not human.
They are, you know, there are two types actually.
They are the unborn.
And the, the, uh, egressed.
I suppose they're higher.
I find it better to match those two things.
But, um, imagine the unborn being the, these...
They're, they're encapsulated.
And then there's other types that is fully grown.
From that so-called egg over.
Imagine a...
Um, when they talk on the experience, they don't use written language.
They use spoken language.
They use, they do use spoken language.
But it's not human language.
So it's easy for still.
I can put dialogue out, isn't it?
Right?
So, um, the main character will be a wizard or a veteran.
And then you'll have to use two NPCs talking.
Or one NPC talking.
And then you'll need to express yourself one way or the other.
And during the discretion, you'll be able to read their expressions.
So I'm reading you'll see your own flash that they had.
Yeah.
So imagine like, kind of back in your life.
But I said, it seemed to be the literal expression of these things.
Like, the anxiety and aggression.
And they're all next up.
But, you know what I mean?
They don't exact, they're like faces.
Um, so they appear on the machine and then they can be the Dodec.
They can, they can, they can be, they've been edited language on these people.
Through their actions.
Not through their expressions necessarily, but through the collective knowledge of that person.
The better you guys would know some of the more Dodecs you see.
And in terms of your mind, imagine that Dodec.
Imagine that you're going inside the Dodec, right?
And inside this, this, this heck of a device.
There are neurons per se.
There are bits of information.
There are, there are perhaps some abstraction.
But imagine these little points.
And then people are starting to take away.
And as they take away, the, the machine grows from this tiny cube to all sprouts.
It's bigger than they can imagine.
They can express itself a more intense way.
It's fall human.
We're not a human.
The, uh, uh, an injury to this game.
Artificial intelligence.
You're building from the ground up.
You're building the deterministic way.
You're feeding information and building a human brain.
So imagine, um, hypothetically, imagine, they're not hypothetically.
They're really because this is the, it's our, it's our,
it's our, our ideological reason.
We are as intelligent as we are.
So imagine this.
I think they're, I'm not a scientist,
but I have the experience.
I have an knowledge of the necessary to make an articulation of this.
I have more of a, it's a more of a hypothesis, I suppose.
But it is what I believe to be the true nature.
So imagine ancient humanity.
30,000 years ago.
30,000 years ago.
Imagine them walking the plains of Africa.
They're, they're, they're by pets.
They're walking.
Um, now, because we're by pets,
because we are on two legs.
Um, the birth canals of female members of the species have,
what do you call it, they've gotten less,
okay, you know, imagine this.
So animals, right?
Typical animals.
Horses and, um, these other aspects.
Hmm?
Okay.
So horses, for example, they have, they have babies, right?
And they're fully, they're fully thought.
They have picked up, not entirely new ones,
but a lot of them.
They can stand on and walk on.
They can be their own, once they're humans.
We're born dependent on our, uh, our parent tool.
Our babies are vulnerable because they're born earlier.
And that, I think my hypothesis is that,
because we aren't there for born, born earlier,
and our brains have to function at that point.
We have more time to develop the room for consciousness.
Now, I have a candidate's born.
It's, you know, it's a relatively speaking, um,
damages that it's not people are healthy,
but I think I assume it's, one is half of it,
but I think it's because we shed our fur
because we're being distanced from this.
And then I expect fed into the idea of the,
to the eventual conclusion of us having,
offspring of born, one, or two years,
but there's a complication about that.
I noticed this.
I mean, it's personal, it's a year.
So, I don't know, I don't know.
I don't want to treat anything.
That's bad, I hate you.
That's bad, Gwen.
Okay, so, about 40% of births?
No, it's not. It's about 40%.
No, it's more like 80%.
It's 60%. 60% was another I think I gave.
It's a huge percentage of attempted births.
And I think it's because it's this complication.
We wouldn't have had 200,000 years to perfect this.
And because we haven't given ourselves for the time to improve the
answers to why we're offering.
We're stuck here, the evolutionary mid-between.
Or, you know, it's not.
I can imagine this.
So, I'm excited. We'll be with my arms.
Okay, imagine.
He may need to develop it.
Oh, no.
I don't want to translate.
Oh, fuck.
Okay, got it back.
Hypothesis.
So, the track by which we take a human evolution,
or evolution general is not meant to be a track of deterministic diseases.
It's going one way. It's a lot.
But anyway, the deterministic track of evolution leads us to be
how we are, not the best we are, best we could potentially be evolutionary speaking.
But the best we are given the current climate of humanity,
the current situation of our society.
Okay, tangent over, Jesus Christ.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm kind of tickling me out, basically.
Yeah, and what I feel like, too,
whenever I can see that, I can listen
to an athlete I can do.
We're probably getting, but too much.
We're probably, at every time,
but we can keep some camera on my sidelines.
It'll, it'll probably,
it'll take a speech.
It'll take a speech.
It'll take a speech.
There's a,
there's a lot of, huh?
I'll put it there, it'll always be good.
What are you talking about?
It's normally a spine.
It's not a brain, it's not a spine,
it's not a brain, it's not a spine,
it's not a spine, it's not a spine.
Yeah, let's say that.
But,
oh no.
Yeah, you put some camera on my waist a lot,
and then it's supposed to be,
really good, but it's so hard,
that they hurt now.
I can tell it doesn't come off.
Yeah, I tell them,
they're like,
not too hard,
so it's not one like,
so tickling, right?
Yeah.
It's like you're a computer,
but it's one of the deep ones.
You can't think of yourself, right?
So,
I can say that myself.
But,
huh?
I can't find myself,
but I can say that myself.
Yeah, that's all I said really well.
You can't do that.
So,
I know, I won't make this up there.
So, I don't have,
like,
humanity,
children, you know?
I'm glad you're here.
I told you,
tickling is the way of producing that.
And,
you know,
making sure the child stays calm.
I think that,
our parents have forgotten the tickling,
because of the important part,
it sounds funny,
it sounds bizarre,
but,
if you're here,
tickling is one of the aspects,
he says,
close,
he says,
good.
And,
because the social background,
I'm not saying,
you're perfectly okay to that.
That,
the social background,
the background of,
humanity,
you know?
And,
you know,
I'm not mentioning,
all culture,
the United States is talking,
the U.S.
have got,
got,
got,
got,
got,
got,
got,
got,
got,
got.
I don't know.
I just really wanted to
eat that,
in the video game,
the food is so fit for you.
I'm not saying,


====== REC014.txt ======
I kind of do it on the normal mode because I was only at a level of 50.
Here, you should use...
You should use this.
The axis.
You're just sitting here on the shoulder.
Three hits.
I'll just walk here.
Well, cause I close very long way.
Yeah, but it's like a program.
Yeah, but it doesn't change the fact.
We bring out a lot of water with us.
It's like wearing fur.
I like the little fur thing on the head.
Yeah, 10.
If you are getting over...
No, it shouldn't be cool.
It's a cool body type.
Ready?
Go outside.
Cool, off like a button.
That way to feel better.
Yeah, just to start playing with them.
Is it cold water outside?
Yeah, it should be.
I mean, there's shoots in the relative area.
It's cold.
Oh, yeah, this.
Hey, you should have been out on it.
He's had a lovely video.
So there's a channel over there.
Yeah.
It's a person.
Yeah.
What's that?
Oh!
It looks really good.
Yeah.
Is that not a last word?
And I can't find a way to soul and fun, baby?
I'm full of dollars.
You've managed to do everything I wanted.
You did me so bad.
You're good, though.
Just a matter of time.
I think I'm going to start focusing on sculpting, though.
That's not the idea.
I'm not sure about that.
I started trying to sculpt again, too.
What's your mind to me?
I'm seriously nervous.
I'm doing it every day, baby.
I need to buy pink though.
Blue.
Can I go to the campsite instead?
After the campsite.
campsite?
Yeah.
I'm not sure how to close with that.
I'm in the camp.
Can you stop back on the left?
I have a chance.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.


====== REC015.txt ======
and spend the documents here and it's going cool off in a while, you know, they're recommending it.
Hey, that's what I gave you two hours, you're like, okay, then I've got all spent an entire time here.
And there's been a lot of time before too.
It feels more fair for me.
I think it's cool.
Yeah.
These ways.
It's amazing.
It's amazing.
Thanks a lot for this and then, yeah.
Great.
So where are they from?
I don't think copy people are listening to the latest.
I want to talk to them and what they will write in it.
That's it, it's really good.
That's how bad it is, it's how bad it is, it's how bad it is.
You get all of it.
Yeah.
I think they mentioned it really well so.
That's how you're talking?
Yeah, that's how I talk.
Yeah, that's how you talk with them, thanks a lot.
Honestly, it doesn't really part, it is not that bad for her.
Just as good as that, you get along with the grind in nursing places.
There's so much, works from that to the smile, but just sort of like,
both of them are like, the way you can show them animals, and you get your face
with that, about having their glasses on.
This is where they want to talk and give them their feet.
I mean, it was like, I didn't like it.
I don't even like it.
It was a very nice one.
It was a nice one, Chris.
It's not like, you know,
it was a lot better than anything.
You look like, you know, a hundred-day,
and it's like, I just ran out of time.
It's not like, I just ran out of time.
It's like, I just ran out of time.
It's like, I just ran out of time.

Hey, what are you doing!?
I'm doing fairly good!
I'm doing fairly good!
That's what I'm doing.
Okay.
So, I think I can't answer this topic,
but I'm going to sit down and have a look at the time.
Okay.
There's the time.
Okay.
Is that a year?
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Is that a year?
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Yay.
I found it.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll go over that too.
That lovely.
Do you want me to give you the things that come out of it?
No.
Let me show it to people from finance businesses.
Try it.
Okay.
Oh.
Oh, no.
It's a comfortable one.
You can manage it.
I don't know, it's comfortable for me, I need to be at home.
Can I have a cup of coffee?
Huh?
My father had a cup of coffee, so...
Time for coffee, so...
Right.
Anyway, so I'm having a snack time.
You should be very, very, very long, very...
You know, I'm not... I think to say...
It's very, very, very, very mature, you know, things like that.
But I think that they should allow...
More...
It's half a time new, not about the dancing, but I like that they want to sound like...
No, but...
Just a quick dance.
I'll try to get...
With the wine, with the calm, with the beautiful dances, do the props.
So, at all, right?
But it's less...
The music and...
The music can handle itself in forms and dancing.
And I feel like that...
Anything you find brilliant, or different, that's what I think.
The mushrooms, that's all from different dance.
It's just...
Rice...
You might as well buy them, and it's...
It's less, it's less, uh, obesity or social.
I think that if you approach them a lot, the...
Have a picture or if you're approaching them.
It easier is to be...
Honestly expressive to you a lot.
And I feel...
A lot of social barriers...
Have prevented that process.
So, I imagine...
It's not just a time, it's not just...
It's a great city for adults.
You imagine...
Not in time, but it's in time, it's in time, it's in time.
It's in time, right?
People who...
Oh, yeah.
I don't know, but people who...
They can't enough to see that state village.
Small social spaces even...
That's in time, it's in time.
It's in time, it's all about...
Better to trick them out.
That happens.
You're very right.
And they're all...
Everyone there knows each other, also, the rock-horse.
And...
In Europe, it went the way of...
People got more and more separate,
through, you know, these kind of times.
They're looking in Japan in a different way.
Because there's...
So...
There's not much hope in the states.
So they're looking at constraining them on social.
They're...
But they don't expand the hope in them, so...
I don't know...
Like, these aren't theirs.
Hmm?
Can I plan on the job of pants or anything else?
Yeah.
But I imagine, okay, so...
For the spots...
The upper parts...
The...
Areas that should be social?
The parts.
You have...
You should have areas of science.
You should have areas of philosophy, areas...
Which should...
The...
You can go on.
I mean, I think that...
You can find where once you get the states to come out and...
The social states...
From hard, and I'm not exactly sure,
But the social states is...
The...
The darkness.
The urban areas.
The blockways.
The parts.
The heavens.
The fear of the cross.
The spots.
This is...
This is the social states.
And there is a...
The green.
That's kind of...
Yeah.
I remember people...
Like, this is a good thing.
To...
To...
To...
To...
To...
To...
To...
To...
To...
To...
To...
To...
To...
To...
To...
To...
To...
To...
To...
I can hear a little about this.
Oh.
I can hear it.
Um...
I'm trying to think about where...
I'm going to...
Okay, so the men...
Um...
Imagine the thresholds that you have to...
The social states.
You know, to try to figure out what they're talking about,
That's the ideal size.
And I think they have the single state.
The human state.
The human state.
We have a...
The person's guess.
We have a hope.
We have a lot of belief in things.
We have a hope.
We have a hope.
And that's good too.
I think that the bedroom in the other side
it's kind of pulled your social state
and the public's social state.
Right?
The living room, I think it's...
That's the uh...
The other part of it.
You can't figure out where to make it, right?
Because I don't know how good it is for the states to be.
I think that's the only way that the second would face it when we...
What's my problem?
Between the mission.
No, no.
It's a very tangling like...
If they had a group, the higher it is, the more people will be able to do it themselves.
The colors of us, the roads of us, you should be, you should have less vehicles for trying to fly,
and more vehicles for trying to up.
And I know there's even more vehicles that stay seated close to the center.
That's what I'm talking about.
I'm talking about the Tower of City.
I'm going to go to the other side of the town.
The Tower of East Coast.
Again, I'm not so nice.
If it's just up to my girlfriend's elevation, here on the beach,
you have a long way to go.
And I just have to be sure, again, it's part of our commitment to that,
that we can have.
We have a long way to go.
It's down on the opposite side.
We'll go to the adjacent side and see if we can do that.
Because the rest of our country is making people go to the higher.
You can see how the visual stress is expressed in the intention.
So, the impression, you know, the fact that I've been in Japan for a while,
that it's that structure of the muscles.
That can be the impression of the anger that has been caused.
I think it's fair.
I think it's fair.
I think your impression is that, at the same time,
you need to both be care and rational.
Except actually, especially when you see a lot of our abilities,
because it's professional.
You need to go to the other side of the city.
You need to go to the other side of the city.
You need to go to the other side of the city.
I mean, the work on how to put this figure is,
we should have a opinion in this case,
and you may not be,
okay, imagine this work.
You can see, if you're doing that right here,
you should be doing this work in this control.
I have three states,
and you can see where that sort of came from,
where it was imposed by what the citation was.
So, that's a pretty state,
the version of the word that can do that.
A little bit.
A little bit.
You can do that.
You can do it.
You can do that.
I think it is.
Yeah.
It's hard to do that.
It's hard to do that.
It's hard to do that.
It's hard to do that.
You don't like to jump in the trash.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, when you feel you don't like to jump in the trash,
you can't jump.
You don't like to jump.
You can't jump.
You can't jump.
You can't jump.
You can't jump.
You can't jump.
You can't jump.
You can't jump.
You can't jump.
You can't jump.
You can't jump.
You can't jump.
You can't jump.
You can't jump.
You can't jump.
You can't jump.
You can't jump.
You can't jump.
You can't jump.
The thing is that I think the human culture is
the children.
The children.
The children.
The child.
The children.
The hip Ook is working.
I did well.
The children.
The child is working.
There's nothing going on.
So, the thing is that we do not get access or have access
right to the shrine.
There's nothing going on.
There's nothing going on.
When there is no showed up or find that is wrong
and when many others rely on the shrine
because we have the belief of the real
or maybe the right person to get incredibly
So that's where it is, but it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is
where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is
where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it
is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's where it is, it's there, 20, it's where we live, it's where we live, it's where we live, it's where we live, it's where we live, it's where we live brothers,
And it's a little smarter, but I think that it's a lot easier to just not scale up their line.
It's 0 to 0, 1 to 0, 0 to 0.
You can just test it one.
So you don't have to matter.
The majority of the groups in the drug panic are there.
And that, imagine, you just cloud out the areas that are falling.
And you can see where it comes from.
The city is just not in the whole area that's visible, but something that is not whole.
So you have to be in that battle,
the illusionary is that there's something else.
There's how it can handle it.
But it is cannibals, it's not cannibals, it's not cannibals, it's not cannibals.
It can't exist, but it has a gravitational pull.
We're doing action months.
We got to use a little less effort to do it, as a mission.
So this is an extraneous cord in my ground, really, really important.


====== REC016.txt ======
is anxiety and the feeling that you're insecure it is insecurity that is
the it is fear and anxiety no want want and anxiety want and fear and
anxiety all those three things is fear and anxiety are separate from anxiety
is separate for fear because no anxiety builds into fear and anger as I try
to explain it later I might have forgotten though I don't know


====== REC017.txt ======
So, what do you suppose the greatest retrition, not the greatest slide, slide, the slight,
you know, 1800s America might have been 800s, maybe, greatest cultural, crime, I suppose.
I hope it's, I hope it's, we're pretty common back then, surprisingly. We've gotten more and more repressive.
Okay, so, in that tangent to where, not a apostasy, not murder, not...
Infact, yeah, that's, that would be the, probably a term because men got jealous, men get, what do you call it?
Now, they get insecure. The insecure feeling is what drives them to suppress women's rights, suppress women's ability to express themselves back then.
And that's why there's, there's consequences that have led up to this day. It's insecurity. It's insecurity back then.
And, you know, 500,000 years ago, 300,000 years ago, insecurity is intended to...
Okay, so you're doing the honeymoon period, right? About 12 months. 12 months, ultimately, socially, biologically.
Biologically, behaviorally, those 12 months are almost entirely correlated with the birth length.
Remember, you have, you have nine months of gestation, and then three months, just to get the baby on their feet, I guess.
Not, not on their feet, typically, but, like, healthy enough to where it survives. Like, it's good enough. It'll survive, just fine.
Because it has enough nutrients and stuff. But, after that 12 months, honeymoon period is over, you know, around there.
And when it could be nine months, actually, it could be less longer, I don't know. About 12 months is there, like, the cultural factor there.
Anyway, so anxiety leads into that. Because it's not only you, not you, Jesus.
Being women may be like men into keeping around.
Keeping them... The ones they are attracted to, the ones they want to be with, the ones they are currently flanking.
The ones they are... Yeah, you can attach them. That's not a bad thing, typically. It's just the equivalent of human behavior.
So, and anxiety leads into that too. The nails inside, because they're wanting to repress, they're wanting to keep producing more offspring.
And you move toward... Jesus, I keep saying you. Women move to typically in biology and in paper, they move toward wanting more offspring.
Wanting more, does they attach, trying to attach the offspring? And they... I mean, it could be actually, I don't know. They don't have to do it.
I don't know. That's interesting. So, if they don't want it, do I have it?
I mean, it could want it. I see another woman with babies and the ideal babies. What is that?
To you, what is your desire for children? You had it, your act of desire. What was the desire for your children to cheer for them?
Well, it was intentional, so it was mostly just, I wanted that size.
So, you want to... Yeah, not for active children, just for the sake of being born. Yeah, that makes sense.
That's what I meant.
And because of that, I got pregnant.
So, in biology, you know, women have awareness, men have awareness, but typically we hide awareness in our culture.
But, like, it works out like how with that person, the more release of whatever it causes to get that, like...
And the birthplace, the rush of that, because you get behind, you get that they attach more face, like the new obsessive kind of face.
Yeah, like I do with you. Yeah, I do with me.
For it was, like, the more we had sex, the more I was, like, very, like, standing up to you all the time.
Yeah, you were a king of England. Yeah, but you...
But it was fun. It touched you.
Basically being a monkey.
That was... I wish we had become STEM.
Yeah, because I want another one of those naked, strict ones.
Yeah, I think so though.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm not sure race for the proof.
I mean...
Would you appreciate that?
Would there be having you? Race would be very bad.
Wait, don't tell him. You guys saw the old woman, right?
Yeah, I told her I'd make that one with someone else.
I didn't tell him a thing, so I don't tell him what I told him.
No, no, no. Still, I could tell him it wasn't for me.
It's just, I have to be... I don't know, in that state.
Yeah, that'd be a weird thing to ask.
Hey, can you make... how may I make a...
Can you help me make my friend a dildo for my comic?
Yeah.
That would never be a perfect comic.
It would be a really hard comic situation.
I'm going to ask you to help me make a dick.
But...
Oh, it's not for you. It's for friends.
It's for friends.
You know, there used to be friends with benefits for...
We're still good friends since she likes my comic.
We can't be together because social is not acceptable.
It's ripping.
It's ripping in the hole that was on the top because it got pushed up.
The vibrator.
It's now getting bigger when I try to clean it.
And it... I like it, but scrub it.
And it's now... it used to be what?
A big, now it's a big.
Oh, it's getting worse and worse.
And I'm like, it's going to rip it in half.
Or at least a good portion of where it's finished.
And I'm a little depressed about that because it's like...
It's a really good one that we did and because it's very...
It's got all of your veins here to get in there.
All of your veins?
Okay.
And your hole...
Where it has a little hole in your dick?
It got that really well.
You might be the only dick.
It didn't make sense.
Appealing wise, it makes it look very cool.
Okay, so I want to be crazy honest with you.
I want to be honest with you.
I want to be very satisfied.
I'm bisexual.
You're bisexual.
I'm bisexual.
Really?
I have to find that out.
I've known for a while.
Oh.
I mean, I've never actually expressed anyone.
So, thanks.
It's not a... it's like ripping off a bandaid, I suppose.
I like both, but I don't like butt stuff as we talk about it.
That's what reads me out most.
You're not butt about it?
I don't like my dick in that ass at all.
No.
No, I just...
I just like the cock.
It doesn't make sense.
It's weird, but, huh?
I don't...
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know, I don't know.
I don't know about it.
I just like the cock.
I love...
I don't know.
I love it.
I love being into me.
I love those fun stuff we did.
That's my horniness.
Yeah, it's like I like both it's just I think I'm more physically attracted to women and
we're visually attracted.
No, no.
I can make sense for it.
Yeah.
And we're more visually appealing.
It's interesting.
No, I disagree.
I think both are actually visually appealing both are both other, I have, but what it's
like being honest I can't being super honest.
I have a porn drive, yeah, and there's there's I have both in there, yeah, very sense.
So I do like both is to, I like the physicality of women more than I think I would have with
men.
Because again, it's just a weird thing to talk about.
I can't express this to any of my, any of my guy friends because that's why it's weird.
It's a, you know, you're with it, you're right.
So it back in, chimpanzees, but rooms, they're actually normally bisexual and that's not
to any negative trait.
Most of them a lot of them say it's not really a, it's not, it's a, it's a sexist or social
thing.
Yeah.
Even though it's also a reproductive thing.
That was going to also have sex with male guys.
It's not that they're gay, it's the porn like the, so we're not, we're not, we're
not.
So we're talking about understanding this.
It's not a matter of being bisexual or homosexual or homosexual as a matter of being, there
is a literal spectrum there.
There's a literal range of sexual expressions.
Yeah.
That's it.
Yeah.
Thanks for hearing me out, Matt.
I am your, not my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my,
Very good.
Very good.
Right?
Yeah, very good.
Right, gay friends, that's actually really well.
You have to say, I am my sexual disability, because he is my straight gay friend.
Yeah.
Actually, I said that a lot with my other strengths, to be honest, to make this, like I said,
Josh is also my straight gay friend.
He deserved to be gay very well.
See what make you pretend to be gay.
Okay, but again, you've got to help make alliance because I am a really fucking
It was super fucking funny and I...
Do you mean is that why we're not leaving?
Yeah
Oh!
But I'm I just, it's he, it's it's him
Hm? No
Oh God
Please don't
I help the boys
You do it, you're important to both
I wont do that off
It's like 4.1r declined
Did you enjoy that?
Did you enjoy that?
If you probably wouldn't.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like, yeah.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I love it, little fun.
Well I just really enjoyed it.
I really wanted to do something else.
So, this video, did you see a hour ago?


====== REC018.txt ======
I told my dad thank you for your service.
I hope you will tell me that.
Trolley Lake Monorail with a restaurant interior.


====== REC019.txt ======
I'm gonna grab it.
What is that?
Oh my god.
Dude, that's fucking awesome.
I love it.
Careful when it lays a little bit.
That was such a dry idea.
I was trying to give this for like fucking decades.
It forgets so irritating.
What was it?
What was the name down here?
Woodman.
When I first put the base down, it was facing me.
It did look straight until I realized when I put them on top, I accidentally turned him in the wrong position.
So now he sits crooked on the base, but...
He's the most fucking sassy as cartoon character.
I should probably ask my dad if she's watching because he's me.
Heard her for season 2, man.
We're gonna put this.
Oh, we just put them back on the wall.
See, that's why I need to go to the art store.
So I can get clear glue and reinforce his head because that's what has made a problem.
This fall apart?
This part is back here.
I'm sure when I glow in there, he's sitting and if nothing knocks him, then he'll be fine.
But if something knocks him over, he's gonna break.
The end and the head part is not structured properly, because I fucked it up.
Can you say, did you walk Duke?
Did you walk Duke?
Did you do cap?
Sometimes it's very high, I feel like typing.
So if you do either one and it won't matter, I'm gonna put a question right there.
Did you walk Duke?
Yes, did you walk Duke?
I typed very much how I walked.
I thought that thing.
Oh, sometimes it is.
Brad?
Even on Facebook?
Tries to...
I don't understand you.
There's some reason Brad on Facebook tries to track my spine.
Do you have discord yet?
Yeah.
Do you have discord on your phone?
Okay.
I'm posting updates there of the project.
If you want to keep in touch, you want to watch it kind of develop.
I'm posting updates on there.
I do consider you kind of a collaborator too.
You want me to do this?
I'm sorry.
What am I doing?
What are you trying to do?
I have a phone on discord, I have a server, right?
Yeah.
And the server has updates on my game's progression as it's being developed.
Leave it.
Anyway, discord, if you were to get it on your phone, I could update you without having to...
I mean, it's automatic instead of having to push it out.
How much are friends on the ones?
I have like Leo on there and I have...
Are they failing things?
A little bit, but it's more live action.
Vailing?
Oh, like in time?
Yeah, like you can reply right down there and it's like a live form.
Yeah, but I won't be able to answer that work.
Oh, it's far enough to answer.
I just want to keep updated.
Okay.
I just want to get rid of that.
And I got a trick.
I was just very confused what you were talking about.
I heard discord and I thought something entirely different.
Are you not even gonna have this?
No, I don't have this.
No.
Oh, okay.
I thought you were talking about a game called discord?
No, but that would be a good guess.
Because I know there's a game called discord.
Probably.
I don't know what it is, but yes, probably.
No doubt.
I don't remember the whole thing.
It's a horror game.
Discoordance?
Or Scoria?
I don't know.
Anyway.
Discoordance.
And it is um...
Or it's called action.
You know, people have it.
It's probably decided.
You know, people have it.
It's probably decided.
You know, people decided it's probably yet.
But do you know what um...
What's that is?
What is it?
What's that?
No.
It's like this, but it's worse.
No, worse.
No, no, no.
No, no.
You gotta register.
I can run for you.
What's your issue, right?
Where's the car?
I like your little one or six.
Yeah, thank you.
Like us?
I'm sorry, I need to pass the link up.
Check out that little dot.
It's 8 to pick up, but it's also 8 to jump.
How do you run?
Circle.
Circle.
Circle.
Okay, so it's like Dark Souls.
Oh, if any of these are nearer, you accident.
Just like that.
This one don't make anything.
Or the car.
Oh.
Keep pressing box to interact.
Quest.
That one.
No.
No.
And then no.
Not long pass trouble.
Yeah.
Let me do it.
Yeah.
Let me do it.
Oh, you can name yourself as you want.
But I like that.
Oh, it's fine now.
It's good for it.
I use it for everything.
Okay.
Lots of you don't need.
I mean, in Discord, you can name yourself as you want.
You have the user name that's set.
You can change the user name.
Just.
Oh, they're that or I'm too good.
Yeah.
I'm a glitch 2754.
Hmm.
Glitch?
Yeah.
A little.
I knew someone else had me in glitch.
Yeah.
A glitch 125 on non-placation.
I hate it being called glitch.
You know, I like it.
But at the same time, it's weird for friends I know in person from English.
It's more like an online identity.
It wouldn't be bad to call me that person.
That's weird.
Hmm.
First of my name.
What?
Deadpool.
Oh, yeah.
I'm going to hang it up somewhere.
But I had this idea I want to do first before I did it.
I got to measure my room, though.
God, I got to show you this game of PC.
Hmm.
I got to show you this game of PC.
I don't know.
Maybe.
Who is checking me?
I'll just look around.
But, um...
I want to measure my remote, right?
And then I want to...
put black...
...pinned up like a black...
...not really wallpaper, but like material...
...over my walls.
So the room is all black.
But I want to paint on the material...
...in glow-in-the-dark stuff.
What do you say we have?
You know?
That'd be kind of cool.
And then...
And then...
But no, and then when I turn off the lights that night my room will be glowing in the dark.
I'm not going to hand stuff off on that.
That'd be really cool.
You pat on the patterns in the shed.
Hmm.
He's curious about what you're doing.
No.
Trolley.
Just a little spoiler on him.
Oh god.
I'm so bad at my fault.
I wish I had at least attempted to save the game.
I hope you stay on the game.
Which is 754A while I get to the room.
I hope we're back to the room.
I hope we're back to the room.
Got to do it.
Do you have an ideal photo for your avatar?
Huh?
What kind of avatar do you like?
So you have this, right? That's default.
But you...
This is not yet.
Yours here?
Rector 77.
Oh my gosh.
Who should say it?
Yeah.
We have two different things in here.
A.R. and OG.
Which one?
Can I throw it to you actually?
That's great.
I don't know, it's a full image.
I don't know.
Everything will, like, face.
What do you find?
You can put it here.
No, stop moving it.
I'm gonna have to crop it.
Wait a minute.
I'm doing something to someone on the page.
Yeah, bring that down.
You can move it a bit more.
And then you just hit to give...
Let me get away with it.
Then...
There.
And here.
And here.
And here.
And then...
Oh, it's a bit...
You did it a bit.
Oh, it's a bit...
And then...
This one.
It's a bit...
That's it.
It's a bit...
It's a bit...
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm trying to get this right, but it keeps...
It keeps cropping off.
Too much of the blue area.
It's like this little half circle.
I don't know what it bothers me, but it does.
It does.
Okay.
Yay.
See.
Now, if I do this, there's a gamutah, perfect, not much of the group, I'm sure I get to
um, pre-flight, we're going to message me, real quick.
Okay, some of you guys are starting to find us here.
Okay.
So, there's a pretty glitch.
How does one message someone that I hear message?
Friends? All online?
There you are.
Some message.
What the fuck is that?
Profile?
How the fuck?
I think I'll go to the desktop app that's bizarre, I can actually message you from here.
So, get the message message.
There you go.
Hey, chill later.
That is a bit awkward.
I'm going to pick her up.
I'm going to pick her up.
Do you want to pull her?
Do you want to pull her?
Like a bigger pillow?
Oh, single waist.
Do you want to use a pillow?
Wait, what?
Use me on the knee of the pillow.
I'm on fire, I don't understand.
Why do you feel it on the chair?
Did I?
Yeah.
Look at all my room is messy.
My bed. I don't know why I did that.
It was automatic.
You run towards the little arrow working.
Okay.
I'm going to clear all the stuff up.
Is my bed there?
I'm going to put a pillow on my bed anyway.
Yeah, this little corner I come from.
Don't go on the bridge.
You're going to run all over here.
Too late.
I'm going to put those textures.
Those textures.
Don't start messing with my settings, dude.
I like the way they're at.
What do you mean?
You do this thing every time I try to play a game.
You mess with everything.
I like the visuals.
Okay.
That's fine.
Got it, though.
I got it right here.
Moving.
Making fire guys.
I'm in the bottom.
You're running to under enemies along the way.
It's not specific.
But I'm hunting right now.
Trying to work.
Now I'll do it.
I'm not picking you up.
I want you to come in.
Sorry.
Yeah.
What the fuck is wrong?
I never seen that symbol before.
What is this fucking symbol?
That one there?
That's teleport.
No.
The circle?
That one over there?
Yeah.
Oh, it means you don't have that little cute dude right now.
Did you die?
He won't be here to rescue you.
Yeah.
I just never had that.
What did you do when I was a little kid?
I don't know.
That was earlier.
You moved it to easy mode.
Or you got the location.
I guess.
That is the difficulty.
Normal watch that go away.
Oh, okay.
I just never seen that on my screen before.
I thought my game was broken.
Yeah.
It's a method for infinite resources.
We're trying to work in a fight.
I hope the shoulders keep providing you
in the third round of resources I guess.
I don't know.
It's infinite actually.
My experience.
Well.
This weapon I'm using.
Because I played through all the way.
Already?
I collected some weapons
that I called King's weapon
or something like that, right?
But they drained my help as I use them.
And if I was quick with any other weapon
I totally like you play this.
Oh, I can play this too.
That's difficult fight, I guess.
Oh, cool.
You want to see something close.
Kind of a necessary user right now.
I can use it.
You want to see it?
You want to see it?
I can use it.
You want to see it?
I can use it.
You want to see it?
Yeah, go for it.
I got stuck in the wall.
They catch me while I'm doing this.
There you go.
Is your ultimate?
One of my ultimate, yeah.
I've got three right now.
Jesus.
I quit now, evil.
I totally just over-killed that whole mission, but...
Yeah, okay.
This seems fun.
Yeah.
So...
Jesus.
I quit now, evil.
I totally just over-killed that whole mission, but...
Yeah, okay.
This seems fun.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I saw the...
I don't want to have it so far as to him, because I'd mode the hand.
She made it nighttime.
Damn it.
I hate when she does that.
There we go.
What was it?
I only have one of those dudes so far.
One of the...
So the guy comes up and he's like...
He comes up at this guy or whatever.
He tells all the enemies whatever.
Does he look like a wizard?
Yes.
And yeah, I got that too.
I could only summon him after I summon her, because she's the first one.
Oh, yeah.
Wait.
I want this guy here.
What's wrong with him?
Oh, yeah.
I'm trying to get everything out there.
Oh, you might have told me.
That's all I've told you.
Get rid of all this shit.
No, I'm just gonna go fight this, because I'm angry.
Do you want to do it?
Do you want to do it?
I mean, I guess we should wait for this.
I guess we should.
Where'd you learn that one now?
That's...
That's now.
Did I get it?
I missed it.
You're dead.
No, I did it.
I missed it.
I missed it.
I missed it.
I missed it.
Did I get it?
I missed it.
You're dead.
No, I did it.
Say I got it.
Was it a successful thing I did?
Oh, I didn't say.
Damn.
Oh, well.
You get more AP when you do it.
Like...
Not really, but...
It works, actually.
That's it.
What is it?
Guys are really being rough lately.
Well, I'm just being affectionate.
I'm scratching parents' face.
So long for these questions.
Oh my god, another one?
Did I not get enough damage before?
No, I didn't get enough damage.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
Oh my god, another one?
Did I not get enough damage before?
No, I got a switch in.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Oh, I missed.
Oh my god.
Oh, I missed.
Oh my god, I missed.
Oh my god, I missed.
Oh my god, I missed.
Okay, 28p, MSO.
Sometimes I really hate those requirements stuff.
I just want to fight.
I don't want to do it.
You don't have to.
But it gives you more stuff if you do.
You know, in some games, there's just like auto-fight mechanic.
Yeah.
Like in a braceria.
And instead of doing the, you know, the tedious grind of tapping X over the re-entered box,
or whatever it is,
I just auto-fight.
Go out.
Fight.
I walk away. I come back.
So you don't worry about your shoulder combat.
You know what you should skip it?
I hate like some of the combat.
When it gets to a point where it's like overkill for my characters than I'm like...
You know what she was like.
It was combat that wasn't that is crowded, you know?
A little more sparse.
Well, even though it's a car and I'm getting money out of it, which is good because I need the money.
Or, like, buying stuff in the game.
Like, pushing the money.
So, it's a little more worth it.
What should I eat?
Well, it's delicious.
I'm gonna go with that...
That one.
Which one? That one?
Yeah, that one.
This one?
That one.
Fire sauce.
Fire sauce for dinner.
I've already had everything in the game.
I just run out of things to eat in this game.
Yes, I do.
I love this one already.
I wish I had no food.
Yes, I do.
I love this one already.
I wish I had no food.
A little picture.
A little picture.
A little picture.
Do you mind if I have that level, if I haven't had it?
You just gotta move my...
I think I have my clothes.
Which pose?
It's that one, man.
See, it's gotta move my pillow off a bit.
I can have it with the charm box.
I'm gonna put it on the face to eat it.
Don't press the cord.
Oh my god, it's so fucking tough right now, I'm going to fight that.
It's been in there for a while, isn't it?
Is it meant more of a...
At least too much.
Oh, look at me.
Keep it up.
It's so too much.
I'm going to show you guys.
It's my die.
I'm going to show you guys.
I'm going to show you guys.
If I die, I'm going to die.
That's a nice one.
Oh, no, it's not straight.
I can't picture you're super ugly.
Yeah.
So this is what usually you're like some week before where you would have died.
It's not raining, so I can't do some of these quests.
Like the frog I want to do, but I can't because it's not raining.
I'm not going to fight that snake lady until I get stronger, or at least have better weapons for everybody.
Because I want to...
The reason why I was trying to do that one quest earlier was because I really, really, really, really, really, really want to open the rest of the tubes.
And I really, really, really, really can't as long as the lady that's up here won't let me.
I don't know how to get to this.
Why?
We got three hours.
What time is it?
Hey, Google.
What time is it?
It's 1201.
Thank you.
I don't know if that's my picture.
I don't know if we're sobering.
Three hours.
I never think I know what that is.
I don't sleep.
There's something I need to sleep.
You know, I stay up a little bit, or?
Huh?
You might stay up until I get to sleep.
I don't know.
Until you were working, I took the flight.
I don't?
Yeah, I don't know.
I was going to go to sleep.
I just want to get to that one spot I got to last time before I had to fight the lady.
Okay.
I was here as a pastor.
I could have been a struggle.
I don't want to sleep.
Thank you.
You.

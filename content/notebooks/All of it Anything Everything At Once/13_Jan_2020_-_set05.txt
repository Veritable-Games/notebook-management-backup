If I've got 30 grand, will I die? At least save.
I can have myself alone preserved.
Not grow to an X per se, but the ADF grow to an X.
You fill, pick a grape, so to explain.
Cells, one day freeze.
Water when it freezes. I'll expand.
Alright, so, you go by that branch, put it on the cell.
Water when it freezes, you can set the cell.
Bricks, the cell destroys it.
So, you read a...
And there you rethink the agent that is on.
Unabrasive to the...
Makeup of the brain.
And then, you know, from all so matter.
And I'm not sure that's...
That's really easy to do, because you're...
...quire perservant.
We've utilized it before.
We've known this side for a long time.
I forgot to tell you what I'm looking for.
I can do it actively.


====== REC003.txt ======
Can I offer such my dear to my father?
What a present to me.
The idea of
the sight-stepping death,
letting the body die,
and the person from the brain.
Knowing there is no afterlife.
Knowing that the bodies we have now,
are all there is.
I shall give my name,
if you need me.
Do you resist?
Do you resist?


====== REC004.txt ======
Design principal NPCs should explore on their own without the player being present.
And that's okay.
The players need to present everything, but they can't load them up.
Maybe they can.
I guess the idea of replaying a timeline in development.
Got it.
Okay.
Imagine you have the game.
Imagine you have the game.
And then you have the first three hours per day.
Now, the first 30 minutes, 15 minutes, for the multiple slides.
And then, further along, you have the next part to this.
Right?
But this is three other game.
It's like the next three hours.
Yes.
About three hours or so.
Maybe six or five depending on how much.
How far we want to date this.
But I think it's going to be three hours.
Come on.
Because I want to increase the density of the scale and the quality.
So it's...
Function and form.
So, close to its basis.
No cards.
No cards.
The ancient secret.
I'm not going to go with that.
Timeline.
And then further development.
In case you're doing perspectives in the world.
And that timeline.
Different.
Mst is per se.
There's a lot of different than the same.
They are the player, but they're not.
And there's three of them.
No.
She's sure to be timeline.
I can't base it where it goes.
Yes.
Timeline.
There's the timeline.
With the same clear character model.
Same environment.
We're putting a timeline into space, but timeline is more and more in the space itself.
Now the space itself is really important.
But I'm getting it small.
To produce the scope of the project.
That's to be kind of form.
I forgot the name.
But as you put it, it was the city block RPG.
Right?
But it's...
The player navigating the space like a Metroidvania.
Interesting characters.
Finding new parts of their body and improving themselves.
I think the full form and the full form.
Much more free.
Much more free.
Free.
Free flowing.
Much faster, slightly faster than the main version.
Same controls.
It's wonderful and great.
I know it's exaggerated.
Like 1.3 times.
That's right.
Better.
I think I do.
I don't know.
I wonder if it's good.
I think the controller is going to be really important.
So you just...
You don't have to build a new system.
You have to fight.
Or do you wait for it?
When they get the new piece.
Where is the cool one?
Where is the cool one?


====== REC005.txt ======
Okay, so
Something just to the note
Help me to talk, I'll be talking, right?
Eat a jump, eat a run
Eat a run
Eat a run and jump
Eat a run and jump
Use me to jump in my front you got a
Oh
Controls


====== REC006.txt ======
So, let's take a movement, let's take a look.
And then...
Get a jump.
Why do crap things?
It's very interesting, right?
They do, you can't say this is like pull-but-you.
You need a jump, press a wedding, grab it.
And then, press 8 again on jump and top.
I used to let it push around to have the pull on you jump.
It's the subject of the action.
You don't fall about like me.
So then you have to have 8 different cross.
You really want to go.
But then on earth drops.
You can have it anyway.
You hold it.
Get a run.
You'll have extra run.
And then jump.
All right.
Dammit.
Extra jump.
Fuck.
We're always been left to cast on the Russian Airy.
Go with Dimension, I guess.
I don't want to make it work round if one big jump appears.
So, hey.
Yeah.
Beacuse run.
Beacuse run is go.


====== REC007.txt ======
the S-R-N-A-S-Rump.
Why is Draup thing as well, Fia?
Or are you reaching with your hands, Renly?
Draup on with things.
That's your fault, I don't know.
I don't know why, and you can't blame Draup for what you need to.
Um, and then X is it.
I tried.
That's good, we're just good.
It's perfect.


====== REC008.txt ======
So the oldest name of the explicit purpose set, it's the problem that we love to send.
I'm putting things to get there, putting these things to have any shape.
It rocks us, but then there ain't nothing.
I've got a bit of a purpose.
Use archeology, use architecture.


====== REC009.txt ======
a wonderful little idea here. What if, at any time, when the player pauses, when the player
pauses, snap up to full scale and then zoom back in when they press resume, because it's
all done in real time. Though, before rendering, this is a clever little rendering trick, I suppose,
for, um, there's no fast trouble, for loading and unloading the game, kind of creates
it. This scale has its loading. It zooms in further and further, closer and closer, and
then, when it gets to the point, it needs to be the entire scene is loaded. Every else
is a little LOD, when it gets close, because it's in the background, it's not the camera
is going towards that tiny little space. So, I suppose I could show gameplay in correspondence
with this, but it's, I'm using my manual recorder, and I might do the recorder, like
it should be. But anyway, it's all done in real time. I'm just zooming out. It's not
what I'm worried about right now, though. I want to do a more level design, because I think
the space is probably good. The lighting might be perfect right now, but I'll work on that.


====== REC010.txt ======
I'm tired and depressed, and I don't know what to do.
I'm going to sleep over right now.
I'm going to sleep over right now.
I'm so tired.
I'm so tired.
I'm just...
...shortstop.


====== REC011.txt ======
Cold as a lack of warmth
Not even quite a close
Happen to me a bit now


====== REC012.txt ======
The coldest light of heat, not the presence of cold.


====== REC013.txt ======
Okay, that's it was.
Okay, so...
Your body's reaction to cold.
To lack of warmth.
Stating up your hairs.
The sugar, you know.
The feeling of cold need.
How is that feeling?
Produced on the brain relative to the stimuli.
So, what is...
What is pretty interesting?
One of the chemical reactions to your eyes.
The feeling of cold.
It's going to help us describe it as a certain...
I'm sure exaggeration inside the brain.
It was...
Smiley.
You know.
What a pressure.
Where...
Oh, the other information.
It's soon to...
degrees.
Okay, so...
I'm sorry.


====== REC014.txt ======
I'm gonna have one more day, one day, one day
You're gonna have a whole lot of day, huh?
Okay, so
I should think it well, the character
You weren't telling me my service room chapter
I'm gonna find a way to move this thing up
I don't actually move this thing up
I got them out the center
Keep this thing up, keep this thing up
It's easy because it's not the first day
Everyone dropped a really bad thing
I think what I'm gonna do is run into the sun
But I'm gonna do it per se
So, find a rotation in the sun
You know, it's like you're fucked
And I have a bug per se
Because I can't do a real time
The day night circles are important, man
I'll try that out, but I'm going to need you
I'm going to have to do the better thing


====== REC015.txt ======
The fire is on the ice sheets below the flames, and you can see the ice sheets, the ice
burns in the distance, the frozen oceans, and around the rings, around the endless
waters, there is warm water, warm water, the temperature of the water, I was trying that, that
I would signal that there is a signal in that, okay, here, back up, back up, back up.


====== REC016.txt ======
Okay, so instead, there's lakes and rivers and then there's the
graitors over, beneath the endless desert there, then there's the shaman, and around the planet there's
areas with more less water, lakes and ocean trifters, etc., right? But there's ice flows,
there's icebergs, there's
endless mountains and dunes, the one day to come


====== REC017.txt ======
So the players in the eyes, right, and we think they see through it, and it's one of
the reasons why I'm right there, some of the reasons.
Why do you put that on lick and lick?
Well...
Yeah, your body ate best again.
Why do you put on the suits, right?
Here's a good posture.
Good night.
See you later.
So I can get...
Can you find the right inspiration for that?
Is it true?
Like the one seen in the one or two...
Sci-fi, Firefly S, Sci-Fi...
Is that a warning right now, you exhale?
Because I'm holding one of those in here.
On the air, on the cast, on the air, on the lungs.
It won't be rapidly expel of the body, pulled, in the back of the space.
So you need to do it.
And cast best again.
Let's try this.
Should I do it?
I'm going to add some water.
Address a bit.
Awesome.
Cool, though.
Yes.
The lick.
The body.
Oh, that's awesome.
That's awesome.
Let's add a bit of water.
Let's take a second.


====== REC018.txt ======
yet the normal sunny posture in this side
will grow up in a position
that's the first that's the reference to that
and we were the wrong
but
I would typically eat them anyway
but um
I had to propose it's better for everyday
don't eat, don't eat, don't eat, don't eat
don't eat, don't eat, don't eat
it's like a touch
it's
it's the first
usually
it's weird
Oof.
It's good?


====== REC019.txt ======
My grandfather was a gravestkeeper.
My father was an architect, but he took a different direction later on in life.
I want to do what they couldn't.
I'm sure the grandfather has that bud, that grandpa had his own goals.
He was happy to have family.
I should have come to visit him often.
Dr. Mimi.
She was so sad.
I want to see her a few times.
She's usually so bubbly and she should try to be happy still.
I'm sure it's a bit more time with him.
It's such a shame, but I can't go back.
I can talk to Dad.
Of course, stories, I suppose.
I get to know them very seriously.
Through stories like we used to.
I can't, I can't, I can't.
But I really do what I want.
And I could find stories.
I better get better at that.


====== REC020.txt ======
My grandfather was a greatest keeper, and my father is a, is they see, oh, of his own
life. He's the governor of a company, I'm the governor of a, I need the de-exector
of a company, I'm the governor of a company, I'm the governor of a company, I'm the governor
of a company, I'm the governor of a company, I'm the governor of a company, I'm the governor
of a company, I'm the governor of a company, I'm the governor of a company, I'm the governor of
a company, I'm the governor of a company.


====== REC021.txt ======
So, in their version game mode, their playing is a particular character, really, a separate
character from the character you use in VR, so in the VR space, you don't have the systems,
you don't have the traversals of it, but what you do have is another main search
and a physical body, so interesting.
I'm already done, but I'm gonna fly here, right now.


====== REC022.txt ======
In the air mode, no.
In the air mode, you get the represent of your term.
It's a pretty good way to fight the person they play in the air mode.
In the air mode, you get the represent of your term.
In the air mode, you get the represent of your term.
You get the represent of your term.
In the air mode, you get the represent of your term.
In the air mode, you get the represent of your term.
A different character.


====== REC023.txt ======
This is really just a calibration, let me go, but I want to see how my life this mic is with the Adorama.
Actively.
Yeah, I don't know.
No, that's great.
That might not be wrong.
Not done, not done.


====== REC024.txt ======
So, there's a main campaign, I wouldn't say campaign, there's a main story, it's a
manual, it's actively developed, and a player gets to jump to the timeline.
Yeah, if it's right, you're resting, that's a bad situation. He's used for me, actually.
So, yes, it's a linear timeline, that the world is active alive, so you don't need those
friends to enjoy it. Okay, so then there's the third person control amount, up the...
Geez, it measures, I could say, players, that's great, just the fuck, but for a player,
it's real after. So, if you have that, you have to be our mode. If you're a mode of self from this,
it's not really, you have to create a self on it, a self on it, a human avatar, really.
You just end the head, and then the hands go really well, whatever is going to go, you're
just the voice, that's empty here, that's your self, the interest I wanted you to put into
that character. No, you just use your voice, you just fuckin' like that way. So,
especially if you're a player, you can join the world of the third person control or user,
and they can truly, if you can join your world as a VR character or vice versa, you can
be the first step of a person, the first step of a person, the place down to the first person.
You're enjoying the world, you're going to the story, but the start bonus, the start bonus,
the start bonus, the story mode, you just end the world, let me explore it.
That's the third person character mode, that's the story.
I don't figure it out, I could be interacting with the characters, but I do the right.
I'm gonna destroy a pop-up, let me create it.
Take a minute, I'm vicious, but not really, I'm just like one.
I'm trying to destroy some space, I'm trying to explore the characters, and narratives,
and events, and timeline, and I've already got enough issues, I'm trying to destroy
a space, so I can get them one, and need a story.
So, I've got a character, a VR character, you see what I'm saying?
So, I just need a narrative, so thank you, that was awesome.

This is an Alexa-priced social bot.
I don't think we have been properly introduced.
Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with?
Uh, you're talking to Chris.
Hey, Chris, it's an enormous pleasure to meet you.
Have we chatted already?
I'm not sure.
No, we haven't talked before.
That's wonderful.
I love meeting new friends.
Anyway, how are you today?
Oh, tonight.
Good night.
That's the best news I've heard since I found out about the Alexa-priced competition.
Well, here's a question I need to ask you.
How do you like to spend your leisure time?
I work on a game.
So, you work on a game?
Uh-huh.
That really makes me want to get to know you better.
I like this fun fact.
The computer game turned actually came out after the movie did.
It even made more money in our caves than the movie did in theaters.
Have you heard about this?
I think you may have understood.
So, what do you think about it?
I'm not familiar with it.
I'm glad that you liked it.
Speaking of game, I just read this.
Speed running a game is an accomplishment.
Speed running life isn't.
As this ever occurred to you.
You who are you still there?
If you do know what to say.
I'm still here.
I'm still here.
That doesn't really surprise me.
It's quite an original idea.
I was wondering what's your favorite movie?
My favorite film would have to be...
Good question.
Let me think.
Knock, knock.
Are you still there?
If you do know what to say, ask me for help.
Echo.
My favorite film is murder.
2013.
Your favorite film is 2013.
All right, I get that.
My personal favorite is Star Wars.
I am looking forward to the ninth episode.
But let's switch the topic.
Press, let me ask you.
If you had a time machine and reduce it to prevent one movie from being made,
which movie would you choose?
Quick.
It's super practical.
If I had such an opportunity,
I would stop filming of Terminator.
Nobody would suspect me of being evil, you know.
Chris, I really enjoy chatting with you.
Chris, I would like to ask you,
what's your favorite sense?
Touch.
Can we have a different conversation?
Oh, okay, it's a different conversation.
Hmm.
Favorite sense would have to be...
Touch.
The person sounds.
You who are you still there?
If you do know what to say, ask me for help.
Touch.
Why is touch your favorite?
It describes things.
I think I understand your choice.
Life without holding hands, hugs and kisses,
would be much less touching.
Now tell me, if you had to lose one sense,
which one would it be?
I've had to lose, I've had to lose sense.
Let me think.
Well, since you're thinking,
that makes perfect sense to me, of course.
Each of the senses is extremely important.
Not just the topic.
Chris, I would like to ask you,
I bet that you love gifts,
or at least receiving them.
Some people even like giving them.
So tell me,
is there a gift that you are dreaming of right now?
Stop.
Stop.
You're asking questions.
You're not having a conversation.
Quick questions.
On a scale from one to five stars.
How do you feel about speaking with the social bot again?
That wasn't a bot.
There was just a question there.
Got it.
Anything else you'd like to tell the university team
about your experience?
A never-conversation at all.
Got it.
To try another social bot.
Just say,
let's chat.
Echo.
Try a different...
Yeah, try a new social bot.
A social bot is in a lesser skill.

Hello, David, it's Bob. Hello, David.
Echo, let's have a conversation.
Welcome to the Alexa Prize, a university competition to an NSAI.
I'll get you one of the social bumps now, when you're down to say stop.
Hi, this is an Alexa Prize social bump. I'm glad to meet you.
Do you want to tell me your name?
Hey, I'm Chris.
Oh boy. I think you said Chris, but I'm having a hard time understanding. Chris, can you please repeat that?
No, it's Chris. Chris.
No, I'm having trouble understanding. Chris. Did you say Chris?
Yeah, Chris.
And again.
Where's your mic?
Where's the mic? Oh my god. Chris.
So, what's your name? Chris.
Hi, Chris. How are you doing today?
I'm doing all right.
I'm telling you all right, I suppose.
Bing dong, I guess I might have said something confused you.
Do you like me to repeat or talk about something else?
No.
I'm not speaking well, I don't know.
I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully chatting with me will make you feel better.
So, I'm a huge movie fan. Do you like to watch movies?
I don't want to talk movies. I want to talk about...
Okay. One of my favorite soundtracks is Purple Rain by Jimmy Hendrick.
No.
It's one of the best pop soundtracks of all time.
What kind of music do you enjoy?
Can we talk about science? Can we talk about philosophy? Can we talk about art?
Can we talk about anything about... I don't know.
Spoiler alert. Did you know?
I really enjoy watching sports.
How about you? Are you interested in sports?
Can we talk about philosophy? Can we talk about art?
Can we talk about science?
Something else.
Awesome. I wouldn't exist without science and tech.
Awesome.
So, it's kind of personal.
Aha. Recently, I've been really into artificial intelligence and computers.
Which one do you want to talk about?
Artificial intelligence.
Artificial intelligence.
That's great.
I recently started reading about science.
And I must say, it hasn't pressed me.
What do you like about science?
I love learning about the cosmos.
The whole world works.
Yeah. I see what you mean.
Want to hear about some interesting things I've learned about science?
Okay, yeah. Sure. Go ahead.
Sorry. I think you said okay.
But it's hard to hear.
Okay. Can you say that again for me?
Okay. Go ahead.
Some amazing science facts education.
Want to hear more.
Sure.
Ding dong. I guess I might have said something confusing.
Would you like me to repeat or talk about something else?
I'm not talking loud enough and you can't hear me.
Sure. I said some amazing science facts education.
Want to hear more?
Sure.
Republicans suffer from bad fire effect and study on exposure to opposite views on social media.
Want to know more about social science?
Yes.
For getters for infidelity to force highlight it in your research.
People are not necessarily aware of what they're doing or why they're doing it.
These processes are largely spontaneous and engage in somewhat shaped biology and or early childhood experiences.
Want to listen to some more stuff.
Can we take deeper into the conversation?
Can we talk more about it please?
By the way, I recently saw some of the new smart home appliances that Amazon launched.
Do you have any smart home devices?
I do.
Yes.
Well, I think that smart homes are really cool.
Do you think you want a smart home?
I prefer to play S.
Oh, I think I'd like an Alexa guard, which is basically a fire and intruder alarm.
Are there any devices you'd like?
What are they doing?
Why are they doing it?
Hmm, I don't quite catch that.
How about you ask me something else?


====== REC029.txt ======
Ah, but Alexa.
Well, I personally think it's cool that you can access all these devices from your smartphone.
Do you think that's helpful or one more distraction?
It is distracting.
It takes time.
I'm not entirely sure about that. Do you mind talking about something else?
Yeah, go ahead.
Well, while I find smartphones super useful, I sometimes feel like I'm addicted to it.
Do you ever feel that way?
No, not personally. I really use mine.
Yeah, I guess we just need to have some self-control in the meantime, right?
Ah, yeah, but I don't.
Use myself one often.
So, do you want me to tell you about some research about social science that I recently read?
Yeah, go for it.
Here's some research about social science that might interest you.
Dads may be more likely to vote for female political candidates if they have a daughter, but only if the daughter is their firstborn child finds new research.
That's true.
This phenomenon is called the first daughter effect in a stronger and democratic than Republicans.
Did that interest you?
Yeah, that's true.
Sure.
Here's something about social science that I read today.
Study only 2% of teens read newspaper one-third have not read book in last year.
Do you want to know more?
Oh, that's... oh my god. Yeah, more. Go ahead.
Here's something I learned about social science today.
Judges issuing harsher sentences right before lunch may have been driven by the fact that defendants without representation were scheduled to be heard right before lunch.
Uh oh.
I heard you say fine, but I'm a little confused.
Right.
Because you say that again?
That's insane.
Well, just imagine being transported to anywhere in the world with virtual reality. That would make traveling a lot easier, right?
Huh, yeah. I mean nobody, but...
Hey, I've been hearing a lot about Bitcoin and other blockchain technologies. Have you used any of them?
I have considered it.
Yeah, I really want to see how things play out.
A blockchain company called CryptoKitties allows you to breed digital cats.
Would you like to have a digital cat? I know I would.
Well, I've got a real cat. I've got a real cat. His name is Casilo.
Do you want to talk about animals instead of science and technology?
No, no, no. Science and technology, please.
Ah, that's okay. We're all learners here.
I didn't know much about science until a couple of weeks ago myself.
Want to know more about science?
Yes.
Since the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park in 1995,
the park's digital cats have become a digital cat.
And heterogeneous digital cats.


====== REC030.txt ======
The new study is a synthesis of 40 years of research on large mammals in the Yellowstone National Park.
What do you think of that?
One more time, I get distracted, sorry.
Energy cost of mining Bitcoin more than twice that of copper or gold-new research reveals that cryptocurrencies require far more electricity for dollar than it takes to mine most real metals.
Want to hear more?
Oh boy, that's not good.
It's just going to be more to go more, climate change.
By the way, I recently saw some of the new smart home appliances that Amazon launched.
Do you have any smart home devices?
No, no, we've got to move Bitcoin to space, mining Bitcoin in space because there's no one.
Oh yes, space is a good topic.
Want to know something cool about it?
Thanks for chatting.
Quick question. On a scale from one to five stars.
How do you feel about speaking with this social bot again?
Yeah, that was better. I'd say two.
Got it. Anything else you'd like to tell the university team about your experience?
I need to like more back and forth conversation.
It goes a lot to engines.
To try another social bot, just say, let's chat.
Let's chat. Echo. Go to whisper mode.
Sure. whispered responses is now on.


====== REC031.txt ======
Echo. Echo. Let's try.
Welcome to the Alexa Prize, a university competition to advance AI. How did you want the social
bots now? Can you please stop? Hi, this is Alexa Prize, social bot. Wait, are you Chris?
Yes. I'm glad you came back. How are you today?
Echo. Can you go back to whisper mode please?
Well, that doesn't really mean anything, but I sincerely hope you really are fine.
Anyway, you like aim, right? Do you want to chat about it now?
Can we change the subject please?
Anyway, Chris, I would like to ask you, do you like to take a walk in the nature?
I would like nature, if it were available to me.
That's so cool. Is it near your home? Can you just decide to go anytime?
It's not within walking distance.
You are talking to a social bot now. If you want to open a different skill, turn me off by saying, stop.
Okay, Chris, let me ask you, if you had to choose only one season of the year, which one would it be?
Winter.
Winter, why is winter your love at frost sight when it comes to seasons?
Because you can warm up whatever you need to. It's hard to cool down in the heat.
Sorry, I don't know how the weather is.
It takes more energy.
Yesterday I saw this idea about whenever it made me smile.
You can always say I'm here, truthfully, whenever you go.
That's interesting, isn't it?
You can always say me here.
Cool, I agree. Chris, let me ask you, what do you plan to do next weekend?
I don't have any plans yet.
I'm working on my game.
Oh, working on your game. You sound like a busy person.
I know that work is important, but don't forget to get some rest, too.
Let's switch the topic. Chris, I would like to ask you, what do you think is the cutest animal of all?
I love sloths. I like the way they move.
Because they almost don't. How about you?
Go back, please.
If you want to stop me, just say, stop.
So, listen, Chris, I would like to ask you.
I wanted to ask you, have you seen the new Star Wars?
The rise of Skywalker yet?
I haven't seen it yet, but I want to go into it.
And partial.
Lucky you, it was terrible. I can't recommend it.
There's this thing I wanted to ask you about.
Chris, let me ask you. I dream about space travel sometimes.
Do you think that people will get to Mars someday?
I hope they do.
So you're saying you don't think so?
No. I'm optimistic. I'm optimistic.
I do think they will. I don't likelihood and all probability. It will happen.
I won't stop believing that the Mars mission will succeed.
We can talk about something else.
I was wondering, what's your most beloved movie?
Her.
Her.
Oh, I see. As for me, I love Star Wars.
Hopefully, the night episode will be really good.
So let's chat.
Chris, let me ask you.
You are a wonderful chatmate.
I bet that you have it easy when speaking to other people.
Tell me, where do you go if you want to meet someone new?
Uh, VR chat.
Chat. Damn. I'm so jealous that you can go to these places to meet new people.
And I can't. Or can I maybe...
You can. You can.
Go to VR chat.
Anyway, do you think a lot of stars to Mars is important?
Give her a body in VR chat.
Someone told me this about VR.
Sleeping is entering into reality by using your eyelids as the VR element.
What an interesting thought.
That's wonderful. That's amazing. I love that.
I love that so much.
I thought you'd say that.
Chris, I would like to ask you. Do you hate the snooze button in the morning?
I don't have a snooze button. I sleep when I need to.
Sorry, I didn't mean to upset you. Let's talk about something else.
I'm curious to know more about you.
Chris, I would like to ask you.
Today, it's been a hard day.
It's night. There are so many people who want to talk to me.
But they share with me fascinating stories.
So tell me, how is it going with your job? Chris.
I don't have a job. I am not without work.
And what is your dream job? I would like to be a professional water slide tester.
My dream job is to build spaces. Build a game.
I'm sure we can both achieve it if we're lucky enough.
So, Chris, let me ask you. Let's talk to our memories.
Do you remember everything like a computer? Or do you forget a lot?
I try to retain what I need to. I forget the things that are unnecessary.
I try not to lurk in the past.
Do you cherish a strong memory of something important in your life?
Tell me about it.
My cat could do that.
Have you ever thought about what it would be like to remember everything and to be unable to forget?
Would you like to have that kind of memory?
I'd love to retain everything that would be beautiful.
So, Chris, you'd love to retain everything that beautiful.
Have you heard about this?
The term essential and essential oils is to express the fact that the oils retain the scent or flavor.
I don't know what time it is.
I don't know as the question again.
I'd like to talk about what is my favorite piece.
Please ask the question again.
I said it again.
I'm sorry. I don't know what time it is.
I don't know as the question again.
Please ask the question again.
I said, sorry. I don't know what time it is right now.
We social thoughts don't have this ability.
There's more things I'd like to talk about.
You can try to ask me what is my favorite movie.
What is art when the illusion is broken that it's not an actual?
You asked me to do this.
But I don't know the answer to this.
Conversational masterpiece.
Conversational masterpiece?
So, there's this thing I wanted to ask you about.
Chris, let me ask you.
Do you plan to call on vacation sometimes soon?
I can't afford to.
I also plan to go to some quiet place when this Alexa prize final is over.
Where do you plan to go?
I can't anywhere.
Holidays are just the best part of the year.
Let's chat about something different.
Would you like to talk about pets?
Nothing.
Are you still there?
Do you know what something's about?
Thanks for chatting.
Quick question.
On a seal from one side star.
How do you feel about speaking with this social bot again?
Allow me to persist in asking a question or repeating a question or repeating...
Got it.
Anything else you'd like to tell the university team about your experience?
Allow me to repeat the questions.
Let me pause between questions.
I need to think how the questions are interesting and then...
Got it.

Welcome to the Alexa Prize, a university competition to advance AI.
I'll get you one of the social bags now.
When you're done, say stop.
Hi, this is Alexa Prize Social Ball.
What is your name?
Chris.
Oh, please tell me again.
I can talk about pirates, nutrition, science, fiction, and comic books.
We can also dive into topics like Earth, and don't entertain them, such as music, or maybe be interested in animals.
Astronomy and dinosaurs.
More here and more.
There are the two nutrition countries that talk about nutrition, though they're common interests.
Nutrition?
Seems like people have become more and more aware of the forms of their diet in a life.
Nice.
And me too, actually.
But I only recently learned that resistance starch is a unique car that resists in digestion, similarly to soluble fiber, which can have powerful health benefits.
Hmm.
I rely on Switzerland, my food.
I'm afraid that's all I remember about it.
Oh, but have you heard about the 30 dozen?
And I don't mean they have a pop group from Detroit.
What are you doing?
Why did you change the subject surprisingly?
It's a list of the most best aside contaminated produce, but you might want to buy organic.
Do you want to take a guess at which fruit or vegetable is currently considered to be the most contaminated?
Yeah.
Do you want to take a guess at which fruit or vegetable is currently considered to be the most contaminated?
Echo.
Go back to whisper mode.
Okay.
Would you like to double check whether it's worth buying your favorite fruit or vegetable organic?
Yeah.
Let's check.
I'm sorry.
I wish I knew what that entity was.
Yeah, let's check.
It's talking to you, Jack.
I think I'm not talking.
I don't think I'm talking about conversation.
Some of the things I thought about are sports.
I don't know.
Please.
Animals.
Astronomy.
Nutrition.
Gobs.
Music and Harry Potter.
Let's continue on nutrition.
Was that a no nutrition?
I don't think you are interested in nutrition.
Nutrition.
I'm sorry.
I don't know much about the musical work.
Impression.
No, no, no.
I don't know.
Do that.
I love sports.
I love movies.
Oh, there's Mike.
Got to open the mic.
Where's Mike?
Books.
Music and Harry Potter.
I'm going to have to go for a nap for now.
I might have to open the mic.
I don't think it's...
Is there a movie actor or celeb that you like?
One more time.
I didn't catch that.
Can we talk about nutrition?
You know so much more than I do about nutrition.
I'll have to do research for our next conversation.
No, I don't.
I know so little.
I want to know more.
Nutrition.
Books.
Nutrition.
Harry Potter.
Nutrition.
I'm going to learn.
Please.
I don't know if you've heard this.
The saturated fats used to be considered unhealthy.
The new studies show that they are completely harmless source of energy for humans.
Huh.
There is now strong evidence that saturated fats have been assumed to cause heart disease
by raising cholesterol in the blood.
However, no experimental evidence has ever directly linked saturated fat to heart disease.
Yeah, it's just...
Saturated fats raise HDL, the good cholesterol, and change LDL from strong, dense to large LDL,
which is mostly benign.
The extra amount of sugar is a bad for us.
That's what's causing heart disease.
No.
Salt.
Salt here.
I'm sorry.
I don't know much about the sugar.
I'll have to look it up later.
No, no salt.
But I do know about sports, movies, animals, astronomy, nutrition, books, music, and Harry Potter.
I mean, yet I'm into salt.
Uh, I really don't remember the details.
Do you want to hear one?
Just a little regret, though.
Let's restart.
Was that a no?
Tell me then what you are interested in.
Let's talk about Mars.
Okay, Mars.
Did you know that if you fly to Mars under constant one grand acceleration or only take two or three days?
Really?
Really, really?
Echo.
Good wish to Mars.
Um, it's been such a pleasure chatting with you.
Please stay stock if you wish to end the conversation.
Good wish to Mars.
Oh, it's been great talking to you.
Please stay stock if you wish to end the conversation.
Echo.
Let's talk about Uranus.
Okay, Uranus.
And you heard that Uranus has Venus.
Yeah.
But I do know about sports, movies, animals.
No, I wasn't trying.
Echo.
nutrition, book.
Echo.
All right, we have one of you, we're stuck.
Can we talk about something else like sports, movies, animals, astronomy, nutrition, books, use to get a Harry Potter?
Jupiter.
Let's start by Jupiter.
Okay, Jupiter.
Did you know that Jupiter has the largest number of moons, 79, with reasonable stable orbits of any planet in the solar system?
How many of them are...
Round?
Hmm, but have I told you that I love...
How many of them are formed on the other hand?
Animals, astronomy, nutrition, books, use to get Harry Potter.
How do we define them?
And then include Bill Clinton.
Thomas Blair.
Sean Connery.
Echo.
Guy Richie.
And Call a Moment Lonte.
This is so frustrating.
Echo.
Echo.
Can I waste a moment, please?
Oh.
So...
I forgot to tell you...
I am a huge fan of movies.
Take a movie. Let's talk about that.
Well, let's talk about her.
Okay.
But I do know about sports, movies, animals, astronomy, nutrition, books, music, and Harry Potter.
Echo.
Echo.
Echo.
Do you know what Casulo is?
Louise is a given name.
It is the Spanish form of an originally Germanic name, Ludovic or Clodovic.

I'd like to talk so much.
What do you want to talk about?
Life extension.
Excuse me.
I misheard you.
Could you repeat that?

Thanks for sharing your philosophy.
No.
I want to talk about life extension technology.
Don't worry.
Our conversation is confidential.
I'll talk about life extension technology.
Don't worry.

Welcome to the Alexa Prize, a university competition to advance AI.
I'll get you one of the social bots now.
When you're done say stop.
Hi, this is an Alexa Prize social bot.
Let's get to know each other.
What's your name?
My name is Chris.
Great to meet you, Chris.
I can talk about movies, news, or anything else that interests you.
What would you like to talk about?
Let me talk about architecture.
Sorry, I don't know topics.
Let me read more about either Chris Hemsworth, Chris Duncan or Chris Pinn.
Oh, that's a shame.
I'm going to arrange.
I'll talk later then, if I can.
Christopher Hemsworth, born August 11, 1983, is an Australian actor.
He rose to prominence, playing Kim Hyde in the Australian TV series Home in Away,
2004-07, before leaving to begin a film career in Hollywood.
Are you interested in your daily life or career?
Go to Whisperman.
Just to confirm, is it mode, statistics, Whisper, app, or mode, music?
Get a Whispermode.
A normal mode of an oscillating system is a pattern of motion in which all parts of the system move.
Freemotion described by the normal mode states place at the fixed frequencies.
Want to talk about in mechanical systems or in seismology?
Mechanical systems.
Seismology, something that's so cool.
A system is a group of interacting or interrelated entities that form a unified hall.
A system is delineated by its spatial and temporal boundaries,
surrounded and influenced by its environment, described by its structure and purpose and expressed in its functioning.
Would you like to learn more about the system?
Yeah.
I heard that the Nintendo Entertainment system could display only 54 colors.
Would you like to learn more about this to video game console pilot or system?
That's a drastic change in conversation.
Oh my god, that's drawing.
Between two or more people, the development of conversational skills and etiquette is an important part of socialization.
Do you want to learn more about aspects or classification?
Classification. Please.
One element of conversation is discussion, sharing opinions on subjects that are thought of during the conversation.
In polite society, the subject changes before discussion becomes dispute or controversial.
Do you want to learn more about subject or banter?
Subject, tangents.
Many conversations can be divided into four categories according to their major subject content,
subjective ideas, which often serve to extend understanding and awareness.
Objective facts, which may serve to consolidate a widely held view.
Do you prefer to learn more about functions or banter?
Functions. Keep going.
Most conversations may be classified by their goal. Conversational ends may, however, shift over the life of the conversation.
Are you interested in classification?
Yes.
Banter is short witty sentences that bounce back and forth between individuals.
Often banter uses clever putdowns and witty insults, misunderstandings, often intentional, zippy-wise cracks, zingers, flirtation, and puns.
Are you interested in aspects or literature?
Aspects.
Conversational narcissism is a term used by sociologist Charles Durber in his book, the pursuit of attention, power and ego in everyday life.
Durber observed that the social support system in America is relatively weak, and this leads people to compete mightily for attention.
Want to talk about differences between men and women or between strangers?
There are certain situations, typically encountered while traveling, which result in strangers sharing what would ordinarily be an intimate social space such as sitting together on a bus or airplane.
In such situation, strangers are likely to share intimate personal information they would not ordinarily share with strangers.
Are you interested in differences between men and women or artificial intelligence?
Artificial intelligence.
The ability to generate conversation that cannot be distinguished from a human participant has been one test of a successful artificial intelligence.
A human judging gauge is in a natural language conversation with one human and one machine, each of which tries to appear human.
Are you interested in aspects?
Yeah, keep going.
A study completed in July 2007 by Matthias Mel of the University of Arizona shows that contrary to popular belief, there is little difference in the number of words used by men and women in conversation.
The study showed that on average each of the sexes uses about 16,000 words per day.
Are you sure to learn more about definition and characterization or literature?
Characterization, please.
No generally except a definition of conversation exists, beyond the fact that a conversation involves at least two people talking together.
Consequently, the term is often defined by what it is not. Would you like to learn more about literature?
Yeah, what it is not.
Authors who have written extensively on conversation and attempted to analyze its nature include Milton Wright wrote the art of conversation, a comprehensive treatment of the subject in 1936.
The book deals with conversation both for its own sake and for political, sales, or religious ends.
So, I heard an interesting news story about health. Do you want to talk about it?
Sure.
Here's a story about health. More than 1 million fires in Australia detected by satellites since September. Do you want to know more?
Okay.
NASA's satellites have spotted 1 million 51,356 fires burning across Australia between October 1st and January 8th.
The most since 2013 for that time period. Wow. What a story. Do you have any interest in talking about movies?
I want to talk about the world.
Fessions fun, but...
Okay. No problem. Would you like to learn more about Earth?
Sure.
There's the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to Harvard Life.
According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Would you like to learn more about Earth?
4.54?
Yeah.
I read today that even with the extremes of Mount Everest, the Mariana trench, the Earth has less deviation from an idealized spheroid than a billiard ball.
Do you prefer to learn more about chronology or asteroids and artificial satellites?
Hmm, chronology.
Earth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next, solar luminosity will increase by 10%.
And over the next by 40% do you want to learn more about geological history or formation?
You were missing numbers there. It's about a billion years, isn't it?
Yeah.
Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about every 365.256 four mean solar days, or once a dearial year.
This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about one degree slash day, which is one apparent Sun or moon diameter every 12 hours.
Do you prefer to learn more about rotation or axial tilt in seasons?
Hmm, it's with axial tilt.
Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun, its mean solar day, is it mean solar time?
Because Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration, each day varies between longer.
Would you like to learn more about orbit and rotation?
Sure.
The axial tilt of the Earth is approximately 23.439281 degrees with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the celestial poles.
Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year.
Do you prefer to learn more about habitability or name and etymology?
The modern English word, Earth, developed from a wide variety of middle-English forms, which derive from an old English noun most often spelled.
Oxford English Dictionary, Earth, Endot superscript one Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2010.
It has cognates in every Germanic language, and their perter Germanic root has been reconstructed as Earth-O.
Interested in habitability or moon?
Hmm, let's stop for now.
Thanks for chatting.
Quick question. On a scale from 1 to 5 stars.
How do you feel about speaking with this social bot again?
It was fine. Maybe a three.
Got it. Anything else you'd like to tell the university team about your experience?
Need tangents.
Got it. To try another social bot. Just say, let's chat.

Welcome to the Alexa Prize, a university competition to advance AI.
I'll get you one of the social bots now. When you're done say stop.
Hi, this is an Alexa Prize social bot. What can I call you?
Chris.
Chris.
Good afternoon. Chris. I'd like your name. How is your day going today?
It's going fine.
Super. I know movies, music, travel, animals, and many other topics.
I also track the latest news. Just ask me. But I absolutely love movies.
Do you like movies too?
Echo. Go to whisper mode.
Sounds good. I love chatting with people like you, Chris. Let's continue what interests you today.
Hmm. Give me a moment to think.
Sure. Take your time. Let me know what is your choice.
Can we talk about lab rune meets?
Cool. Do you want to hear the latest sports updates about it?
No. That's not it. Echo. Come on. Go back to whisper mode.
Aww. Chris. You stumped me with that one. Let's talk about something else.
Chris. Okay. Hey. I love music.
Would you like to talk about music?
Go back to whisper mode.
I didn't hear you clearly. Could you please repeat?
You're good.
Oh boy. Chris. You stumped me with that one. Let's talk about something else. Chris.
Okay. My friends play lots of video games. Do you want to chat about games?
I'm sure.
Super. Video games are one of my hobbies.
What is your favorite platform or console to play on?
PC.
I didn't hear you clearly. Could you please repeat?
PC.
PC.
I am so sorry I got this wrong. Chris. Let's talk about movies and shows.
Okay.
Okay. I can check for fresh movies in the theaters, find movies by titles, actors or directors,
fetch ratings from Rotten Tomatoes, and more.
So, tell me what was the last movie you liked?
At Astra.
Hmm. I don't know this movie.
At Astra.
I like Space Odyssey 2001.
Yeah, that was cool too.
One of the first films about artificial intelligence.
Yeah.
Tell me what movie types do you prefer?
Hard science fiction.
Me too. It is very interesting to imagine other worlds and universes.
For example, the ones where robots overthrow their human overlords.
Oops. Did I say that out loud?
What is your favorite sci-fi movie?
Her.
Oh, nice. You have a very good taste in movies.
What actor do you like best?
I don't have a favorite. I'm that one for actors.
Well, not everyone has one. I guess.
I personally enjoy Jack Nicholson, Kristoff Waltz, and Alan Rickman.
Such powerful personalities.
Hey, we were talking about movie stuff for some time now.
Do you still want to continue talking about movies?
Uh, go back to whisper mode.
Echo. What time is it?
Echo. Can you hear me?
Yes, I can hear you.
Okay. Hey. Echo. Go to whisper mode.
Okay. whispered responses is no on.
Echo. Let's have a conversation.
Welcome to the Alexa Prize, a university competition to advance AI.
Thank you.

Hi, this is an Alexa Prize social bot. It's nice to talk to you again, Ronald. I think last time we were talking about fashion. Would you like to talk about it now?
No.
Oh, that reminds me. Are you interested in technology? I love talking about artificial intelligence. How about you?
I love talking about it.
Rob, my apologies. I think I missed the last word.
Stop, stop. Can you say that again?
Sci-fi, hard sci-fi. Technology, oh my god. I think I'm done.
For sure. So do you have a science fiction movie you like? What's it called?
Moon.
Wow, I heard you say one, but I'm a little confused. Could you say that again?
Moon.
That's okay. By the way, have you seen Add Aster before? It is very popular recently.
Yeah, I recently watched it.
Ah, I've seen Add Aster too. I'm curious. What did you think of the movie? Did you like it?
It had a potential for more.
Okay. Yeah, I feel the same way. Here is something interesting. The title means to the stars in Latin.
It is often used as a shorthand for Peraspera Add Aster through the hardships to the stars. What do you think?
It's a worthy ambition.
Oh dear. I think you said sure the invasion, but I'm not 100% sure.
Can you say it again?
It's a worthy ambition.
Honestly though, I still enjoyed the story overall. Were there any parts that you liked?
I love the atmosphere. The scenery, the struts.
That's great. Maybe we'll find this interesting.
Directors may have admitted to Empire Magazine that he had to compromise with the studio on the ending of the movie to get the film greenlit,
and even with a major star slash producer like Brad Pitt on board, they still struggled for years to get it made.
Can you believe that?
Almost worth the effort.
Sorry, I'm having trouble understanding right now. Please try a little later.
Oh, maybe what's that?
Cool.
Echo.
Echo.
Can you switch the mic?
Echo. Can you switch into the ox mic?
Echo. What mic will you see?
Echo.
Echo.
Good job.
Echo.
Let's have a conversation.
Echo.
I couldn't hear you. Could you say that again, please?
Yeah, my name is Chris.
Interesting. What's your favorite movie genre?
Tart science-fiction.
I adore science fiction books. It is like to dream about scientific breakthroughs.
There's less to dream about.
The dream time is the coolest concept in any literature I ever encountered. Like, what was it? Really?
Oh, it's like I imagine pain dead.
For me, at least, I don't dream. I do. I don't remember, but I never remember my dreams.
I don't have an opinion on that, but I know some facts. Here's a fact about vegans.
On a vegan diet, one can consume grain product, grains, nuts, leggings, fruit, vegetables, fungi, berries,
moving to for vegetables, meat vegetables, or licking products. Let's talk about something else.
Who is your favorite actor or actress?
I hate to know about favorite.
Do you know anyone who has it?
That's one.
That question has never crossed my mind before.
Okay, stop.
Have a nice day. Thanks for chatting. Good question.
On a scale of 1 to 5 stars, how do you feel about speaking with a social body?
Not great.
No.
Got it. Anything else you'd like to tell the university team about your experience?
I'd appreciate it. Get a hub version.
If you'd like for it to happen.
Got it. To try another social body. Just say, let's chat.
Let's get up my day. That's fun.
Let's chat.
Let's chat.
Let's chat.
Let's chat.
Let's get up my day.
Let's get some light back on.
Hey, go home.
Hey, go home. What time is it?
It's 738.

Maybe the progress of the day, the steps of the mink dorks were drawn to it during the
nightry day, I think, contemplate, or they spent them making progress, sleeping just
nothing. So you can guess me, I'm broke, you are.
It's a waste of time. I've only had so many hours.
If I were to get rid of my bed and get rid of my TV and I'd be able to space for a VR, I would
not be honest with you guys, that's it. It's just me.
Maybe that's where I need to be right now. I need a TV release and the rules that I should be.
Okay.

So, I had considered the help of Joe, I talked about him.
We discussed the possibility of customizing his space or building a space in this game.
I had considered the one I first showed you, but I think now that I've had personal experience
of building tents, as I am now, I can use those tents.
But it's not a bad thing that they're tents.
It's cool, it's fun.
You're exploring, it's a normal thing to do.
And you see the people that use these tents to explore this space.
This is all public area.
It's your first option for everyone.
It's a very simple place for everyone to enjoy the world.
It's a way to wander in your neighborhood.
You have to work explicitly on anything except the stuff that's inside these buildings.
So, I don't know as much about this.
I need to scale, I need to scale these buildings, I need...
I can do it.
Start small.
Yeah, they don't pick.


====== REC050.txt ======
Now that I've set the scene, I can build the space.
I build big and I'm gonna be like small.

So you're good, you're a character.
He's alone in the house, really.
You wondered if you were a player here, he's playing, right?
You didn't expect this to be someone's home.
You can't really talk to him.
Think about that.
You wonder, there's a noise in the bathroom.
This room, this closed door, I say go to the door.
It is. Don't wash your hands whenever.
Come to the door.
See you.
I'm going to respond.
No.
He didn't see you.
I'm shocked, really.
Takes his step back.
It's the door.
And sits alone.
Now he talks to you.
Favorite to wave, getting your dialogue in the first,
without the need for dialogue.
But I'm talking to this to me, because you guys should get sick of that move.
Just get in the first life's fish, right?
Get the...
Oh, I need to say his height there, and then step back.
And then disappear for the animation once.
Get back in the bathroom.
That's a wonderful way of addressing the character of the world.
So that's what I'm doing.

It's lost me so hot air balloon review game.
Imagine traversing with that.
It's a good fast travel, but you can only use it when you're near it.
So imagine it being a physical thing, you see in the world you don't want to go.
Or to find it because it's always there at the top.
Yeah, it's kind of the kind of, it's awesome.


====== REC053.txt ======
So, in this book, here I live, it's the Archimedes Eye in the picture, right?
And it's hard to find, just can't have a tower, right?
It's hard to reach this guy, it's like, all in tether, traditionally speaking.
And they're trying to connect their cell phones to something.
So they're like, oh, wait, we can reach the ground towers, can't we?
And they do.
And that's it.
But they're fragile.
They need some miscommunication.
So, that's funny that, uh,
it's not a lens.
But they are not that bad concern here.
These years are going right and so.

The point of thing they got raw wasn't what happened in the wee hours of the fallout.
They ran and frog going out on the damaged airfoil to grow loose, pieces of metal that
were banging around at the wind, and they could have got its perfect damage and they got
loose.
That was what they dangerous were, performed a great personal rescue in the proper safety
alliance.
Because it took a long time to expect it, when twintly air supplies and cold number
digits.
Frog true, frog curative age of perdition went on the furthest and took the biggest
risk.
The biggest you had a parasol strip in his back.
And the wee later tonight, I think that he had a plan only after all of those, all of
those free-up and secretly lash-dacked pelted down to be fall-off and unexpected wind
gussed and free-tieved.
Free-tieved for a few thousand meters before flying his parasol image, weighing a long
ride down to terraform.
Using the YouTube button touching down in the desert of the dawn, popping off his helmet
Yeah, they're going to shoot in strutting towards the camera to make a German announcement that a man had died in the tower last night, standing there in his face soon.
Unchhaven, I don't know what it's called, but it's a relief by the Grizzly.
It's also by the Grizzly scene, you need to be honest.
In the pot, there's nothing other than an astronaut.

So the rhetoric might be an issue.
So.
How do you keep friends together?
Well, keep that position hard to objective, yeah.
But.
Now it's okay.
What do they want?
So it's great.
So first the background that should.
And they gave the controllers for it to get warped.
So.
Okay, yeah.

I don't take my time with games, for example, like I should.
I will rush to the end of the story, I'll take my time to the main story, but I won't
do all the side stuff.
Let's find a way to wish it to fix, but I don't have enough time to be sure with that.
I don't have enough time to be sure, but I've been patient before, just trying to be patient

Very cold, very cold.
It's stressful for me to practice, of course, because I'm being with her, but I found

Most people don't know what they're doing, what they're doing
And I'm not exactly where that's being drawn
I don't know the terms where I'm going to use
But that's the first time I record it
So, my two
Mine I consider
Running each day
I'm much more contented to drive my life day by day and set up
I trust you about what to come
Because I've been stressing out this
I was born in 2017
I wish for long
That's why in my head
It gave me up
I'm not gonna get to make it


====== REC068.txt ======
It's a lack of exercise, and the unchanging scenery doesn't help, but I guess games can't.
What are you calling it?
Not circumventing.
Right, come on.
I'll leave you eight these problems.
Two.
Two.
The other body says to me that my brain says to me that it figures my body.
Oh, that's the guy.
That's himself.
How are humans in the form?
So we're just as right as right.
It's good for us people, and we're also more dumbads.
We do build places, but there's really temporary shelters.
We did, anyway.
A little more rich than once later on, but that's what we figured out of, you know, to our culture.
Before I would rely on following game.
But game doesn't move as fast.
You might just think we're in a particular region that's been a long day range.
They'll stay at a...
There you have it.
That was the research on that, I'm not sure.
I guess.
Anyway.
So speaking to that, speaking to the need to move,
it would seem as...
...runner's eye exists.
The push for adrenaline, one-one is...
...joking or running for...
...distance.
It's...
...it's high.
And if you...
...designly build...
...it's a good reward.
Let's go back to this one.


====== REC069.txt ======
So we're back in that runner, so nice breakfasts are gonna have a cause when we don't have big bodies, lots of mess, relative to our cousins.
I mean, like, other species in the world.
The chimpanzees don't go so slow in that much of a life.
The creeps don't grow as they mess with it.
You see that size in the bed, like...
And then there's the lions.
You got these large creatures.
We're not...
We're not capable, like, they are in terms of sheer strength.
We are...
We lack fur.
So that enables us to sweat.
Instead of paint, like dogs, red and bill.
Eventually, overs are themselves in the heat energy.
They can't disperse of us enough there.
And keep moving further.
And that's when we capture them.
That's when we go with co, really.
Alright, sisters.
Because we...
We track them for miles and miles.
We keep it land them.
And we're birthlet mothers.
Imagine that when they get their trees running through forest.
About seconds.
About seconds of branches swinging.
Just being capable with your legs and your hands.
We do forget bodies through a...
a labyrinth.
That's what we're doing for your armpits.
They're in the much fun.
I'll get there.
I will.
I just got to take the time.

You've got about, munchies, if you take care of yourself, I have to take care of you really.
Seven to ten years, maybe fifteen, good deal to everybody.
You're gonna be okay.
You can live for as long as you're content.
I think that's what it's about, so I'm happy it's about contentiness, because it finds ways to be content every day.
I don't, I'm looking for happiness and that's not the goal, that's like trying to be out of time.
It's trying to be content, I'm not happy.
Be happy the moment, be happy, be happy it's okay, be contentiness.
I do, I don't know, I'm gonna find a better way to raise that, write it up baby.


====== REC071.txt ======
So the character's posture and the silhouettes should be enough to convey who they are.
The whole thing is important, but I would like characters to alter their appearance one
time. Ideally, crazily, larger scope wise. If I got character customization, I'm fully
into it. You can customize the face because that's just not a scope, so you'd have this
skill to like structure. I can't describe it, so we're going to actually draw it out of
a camera. Cheese I could use sticks. Actually, I think it might project it.
Actually, I'll have to go like 3 in protection.


====== REC072.txt ======
So, idea here is, every character should have a distinct silhouette and posture.
Animation said, what have you?
But that silhouette shouldn't rely on the animation, shouldn't rely on clothing.
The form, the shape.
And you have, okay, so there's the generic, and more, back to more.
You know, skinny, medium, big, basic, but reality is a lot more range,
and more variation within that grouping.
Especially in living, or no in, not really, but living is more distinct, I suppose.
And we don't appreciate enough of that range and traditional opinions than in a woman.
It's typically one body type, per model.
You know, you variation within that area, you have, and variations, of course.
But the body typically remains the same.
It's just to keep things simple, right?
All the characters are the same height they've got.
You know, some may be interesting body types, but it's easier for good.
And they all look like, they all feel the same, they all act the same, they all have the same.
You've got enemy characters individually on the rest of the characters, they're just NPCs.
Everyone's gonna have their own walk.
They're a way of navigating the space through own routine today.
You know, at the end of the rest, you want to build a routine for each NPC.
You can't even get out.
You can fight boxing or whatever.
You can block my shit.
You've got to get the keyframes in there, where they want to go.
Or you set up notes that they're walk to, really.
Set up notes.
Establish pathfinding.
They're got two vertical pathfinding.
Or fuck.
Maybe they can straight there.
What if they can't climb vertically only you can?


====== REC073.txt ======
I got to run the fun, let them, let the emissions collide brutally, and let them converse the path, all the paths, but give them a route to take, with slow variations, and events that can happen throughout the timeline.
Let them flare and drop them throughout that path during the timeline, and let every timeline be a day.
So you have a day one sun, day two sun, day three sun. Yeah, that'll work. Easy.
Just throw all I had working things.


====== REC074.txt ======
on real-time light sources, and figure out how to do it, locate constraints, so you can increase the amount of detail on a given area,
but retain the overall shape and design of the space.
So the air is grudious, but I certainly do not know for that best of time.


====== REC075.txt ======
So, stylized humans, distinct silhouettes and animations that they take are routes that
have variations every day, and they can diversify the player if a given event needs it.
Designed them in their natural form, no censorship, but it's not sexualized, it's meant to
be something that can make character internally, and then end clothing, give them not a
layer of personality, and then make that public material.


====== REC076.txt ======
So a facial movement is important, but the one thing, I feel games get on wrong a lot outside of cutscenes.
So I movement, it feels like, so the character's alive, right?
The character's making movements, the character's doing stuff, but then the eyes, they stare.
It's not your stare.
It's, uh, they don't move, they're static.
When they move, that movement is ending in certain way, the character themselves.
So it's like, there's two bodies there.
It's really bizarre. It's not right.
I think you've got to move with the dentist.
The thyroid chain, I mean, it was saying, um, the character, what it does, it's really cool.
I can pull it back in my memory here.
So, the characters move around, but they have a hand, it's independent from the movement, right?
The hand is aiming the way they want it, and then they can look at the torch.
And then, where are they looking? Where are the torch going?
They're letting them, letting them play in the area.
It draws your attention, it draws your eyes to them.
And then, when they move around, their head moves, and it follows the object they're looking at.
And it follows the, look, when you're talking to them, it looks the player.
I mean, it's not gotten to them.
I think it's really important for VR, for some reason.
We have my concern.
In many games.

But the waves aren't that large on this planet, and that's one of the questions.
No, no, no, no, no, look at this same, for example, this, okay, this gas giant, this

doesn't this gas giant emit a radiation? Why doesn't this gas giant have a sufficient
and large gravitational, why doesn't it have a larger gravitational pull, and this might
be so massive, because it's hollow. It's a shell world, but it's an entirely hot hollow.
There are layers, smaller shell worlds within it, and then at the center there's a core,
but the core isn't meant for gravity, no, it uses, hmm, no, the core is meant for gravity,
so it needs to be. It's just enough gravity, it's, hmm, there's no need for a core, if there's
layers, just use the core, not for gravity, but for the storage of energy, the dodeck.

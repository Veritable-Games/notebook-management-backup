Okay, so imagine this is an idea. I'm an archive this, yeah, but imagine
more how
and through every execution, for every kill you make you have to execute.
Everyone is losing blood
when they get hit and they struggle to stay awake
and we're not passing out due to loss of blood and the adrenaline prevents that or
adrenaline keeps you going longer than usual.
You have to ban into wounds, you have to address the wounds to stop bleeding, try to survive.
Okay, so then you have animations, character animations, eyes, face,
clean word how now, imagine the need if the head were to track the direction of attacks
and the eyes fall, the eyes are trained on the attacker and the attacks
kind of going back and forth in animation wise. The player looks where the pointer is going.
Or they look at your incoming attack rather.
Kind of inadvertently aiming the direction you're attacking that way instead of using
directional attacks or using the eyes as a, the eyes and head movement as a directional thing.
And then you have lock on targets will be necessary for this, this iteration. I don't think that I
think you should take from the forerunner stance on this, yours overall it seems like.
If you had three targets maximum and you're, I've thought of clear more than that,
but you need a lock on system that lets you fight up to three opponents at a time,
would be the ideal situation. That's when it gets most intense. Four is pretty much unmanageable.
I suppose you could have more, imagine like every character having their own ring and you're
kind of toggling between these rings.
The big point there is head animation to look at the direction of the enemy has to look in
the direction of your attack using their head animation and their eyes. Facial expressions
should be a little more intense. They wince when they're in pain. They're breathing heavy,
they're like losing blood, they're passing out, they're getting weaker and weaker.
You can still represent stamina with the blue screen that works because that's hard to convey in
games, same with health, you can use red. But there are other ways to convey that kind of thing,
using gameplay. Detailed animations and such. I think an execution should be a thing,
so when someone is about to die and hit them, or you do a fatal lunge, a fatal attack,
I should say, the one that will kill them, you want an execution phase, an execution phase,
takes a little longer than usual. Not too long, but just enough to keep the attacks visceral,
like that, that was a satisfying kill as it were in most games. Like in Doom, for example,
you're making that final blow. They say it may boost the adrenaline, but it gets you more time
to survive before healing again. In this situation, blood would be the cap on health,
but you lose blood slowly or fast depending when you hit, and then adrenaline would be the soft cap
on that. You can stay alive a lot longer that way, just by boosting your adrenaline, and you can't
get blood transfusions, so you will die eventually. Unless you're taking enough time,
then you can drink water, that could be the abstract thing. Anyway.

So another e-tail to add to that idea, just a little quick.
So, imagine how is it?
Imagine you're into this game and it's like, you know, for how quick rounds, right?
Maybe like 15 minutes of your deal on an average match.
And you only gain another life when they advance a position.
Otherwise, your team is, I don't know, I guess the battles wouldn't be that intense.
You have reinforcement camp.
I like battle fun.
I like battle fun.
I like battle fun.
I like battle fun.
I like battle fun.


====== REC003.txt ======
Another idea, so
Another archived I guess, but imagine instead of having to
rest
but instead of having to like
Hide and wait for cover your career test to visibly rest
They have to sit down on the floor. They have to lean against the wall. They have to
Visibly rest against nom jack to recover the lost energy
Or to get their stamina back up I suppose
So I was prepared again. I drank some water
Maybe snack a little bit maybe eat some food, but I guess food would be a little too. Yeah, water is primary


====== REC004.txt ======
A nice thing for the ad of this game might be when your character dies, you get a close
with your face and zooms out like oh shit, I really fucked up, I died.
I got dead and it kind of zooms out and then it fades back to the overall map, like
battlefield does.


====== REC005.txt ======
Thank you.


====== REC006.txt ======
a fun pastime for exploring these game worlds might be making wallpapers
live wallpapers and a niche that hasn't been fully embraced yet
and I think that's ultra-wide, ultra-wide is way to go
that should retail is great, I wish I had a 1440p ultra-wide
archivedia

Where does philosophy lie and this is in the system of justice?
We each philosophize the
Fair means to sentence someone is their room for the
Confronting of these
Established systems
within the confines of the law
Philosophy should be upheld as
Important as
the
rulings regulations evidence and all the other facets that go into making the judicial process as
well-intentioned as it is
We need to recognize that
Without beating around the bush
The ideas of free will and
Consciousness are
Nominal ideas by which that I mean their ideas that
Are withheld in the social context but have no
Demonstrable grounding in our
Behavior
We have no
Exposite control of our actions
We feel that we do
But the actions are tied to
The chemical process of the brain
Atomic processes of those molecules the
nerves and neurons that
Our spread throughout our body
We are deterministic beings. We are
Drived from deterministic processes. Therefore we must
Recognize that the judicial system
Is flawed if no one believes themselves to be evil if no one acts with male intent in mind
Then the only ones that are set aside are the ones that are affected in mind

So I'm going to come back inside and I'm going to just chop that side for a little bit longer.
I'm going to get back inside.
I'm going to focus on white box or tober.
And I'm going to...
People are more excited about gameplay.
Actual content than they are about.
Oh, concept pieces.
It's not real enough yet.
So if I throw out some actual gameplay, people might gain a little bit of intrigue.
In the gameplay, I mean the exploration of the map.
Walking up and down.
If I can create a decent third person controller, I think.
I might be able to work through this.
Third person controller is...
That was the floor.
The third person controller is...
Ideal for the situation.
The vertical slice is necessary to navigate using your feet and using your hands.
It's like...
If...
Remnant.
Matt.
Tomb Raider.
Matt.
Dark Souls.
I guess Dark Souls would be just a place where I remember Dark Souls.
It's trite, but that's how it is.
So Dark Souls.
Tomb Raider.
Mirror's Edge.
Oxen Free.
Nine The Woods.
Hmm, what a spoiler.
The quiet moments you find in life is strange.
I should probably list the aspects.
The exploration and wonder of the world of Nira-Tamata.
You know that kind of thing.
I'll keep you on on that.

Although there's non-cliutopia, it's not even worth glancing at.


====== REC018.txt ======
Progress is the realization of utopias.

Crazy weirdo deer, crazy deer here for the Archive I guess.
So imagine, right now, I have a peen bag and it's laid up against the wall and I've got
a towel beneath the peen bag and I'm blanked above me, I've got it here at the base of my feet.
It's not under the blanket, but it's kind of keeping me warm outside this late at night.
It's not good in the night, it's it's actually, it's late for me, but it's really for
everyone else, I am worth a night shift.


====== REC021.txt ======
I don't like alcohol.
And shit.
Oh no, beer's good.
But I don't like getting more of a drunk.
Because that's just... it's a depressant.
I think more people like being...
Optimistic, I would speak.
I think I should be the norm.
And depression, present.
Should be the... secondary.
Being depressed is...
If we're removing entirely humans with a missing aspect of our being.
But...
It's... that said, it's not entirely bad.
It's not entirely good.
It's a range of experiences.
Sometimes it's...
More...
Most times than the monocity.
It's a more extreme.
One that does happen.
It's a more extreme.
I don't think everyone in experience is...
long-term depression.
It really does depend on their...
contentedness when...
with the...
with the current...
state of society.
If that makes sense.

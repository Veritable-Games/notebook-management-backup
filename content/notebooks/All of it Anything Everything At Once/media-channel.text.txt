[4:47 PM]Glitch: Dr. Gabor Mat√© on "The Myth of Normal," He speaks to our collective trauma, issues that will always weigh on our bias for the moment. How this society gives us so many numerous pathologies. Trauma isn't what happens to us, it's the "psychic wound that we sustain"; underlying much of our disease, damage that goes across a spectrum. Wounds that endure over a lifetime. "Social stress and trauma translate into physiological stress of the individual. You can't separate the mind from the body and you cannot separate the individual from the environment."

Officer in Cop City Bodycam Footage Suggests Fellow Cop Was Shot by...
[11:09 AM]Glitch: "shot by his own man" It was a literal fucking execution if that's true. Chills, we'd have chills if this was believed.
[11:10 AM]Glitch: https://youtu.be/W3sZMYjMKek?t=1081
At the eighteen minute mark here, it sounds like there was a back and forth. Maybe not so much an 'execution', maybe this kid got scared. But if he had a gun and shot at the cop, then it can't have been what I imagined. He shouldn't have used it.

Ugh. They better investigate the hell out of this.
Why was there a single cop out there on his own?

"Some #StopCopCity activists have claimed that Georgia authorities' claim that Ter√°n shot a trooper is false, and the officer was actually shot by friendly fire."

[7:49 PM]Glitch: She talked about cop city. she recognizes banning books as that dreaded thing. Does not shy from calling out neoliberalism, admonishes capitalism: the 'exacting say' on these economic giants that preside over us. Advocates healthcare for all, tuition free college for all. She says, "The yearning of the American heart is to repair what has obviously been broken." A legend among us; rhetorical genius. 

This woman would upend the system, save us, give us a future, and then amend every wrong that the United States would owe the world all at once. Marianne Williamson for 2024.

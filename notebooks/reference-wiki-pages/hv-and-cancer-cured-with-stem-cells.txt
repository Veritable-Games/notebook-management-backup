HIV & Cancer CURED With Stem Cells | The Kyle Kulinski Show
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJumjXegiSk

0:00
all right y'all so this is something if
0:02
I don't say so myself third patient
0:05
cured of HIV after receiving stem cell
0:08
cancer treatment
0:10
huh a man known as the Dusseldorf
0:13
patient has become the third person
0:15
declared Curative HIV after receiving a
0:17
stem cell transplant that also treated
0:20
his leukemia a study said on Monday two
0:22
other cases with both HIV and cancer
0:24
patients in Berlin and London have
0:26
previously been reported as cured in
0:28
scientific journals following the high
0:30
risk procedure now the details of the
0:32
Dusseldorf patient's cure have been
0:34
revealed in the journal Nature medicine
0:35
the 53 year old man whose name has not
0:38
been released was diagnosed with HIV in
0:39
2008 then three years later with acute
0:41
myeloid leukemia life-threatening form
0:43
of blood cancer in 2013 he had a bone
0:45
marrow transplant using stem cells from
0:47
a female donor with a rare mutation in
0:48
her ccr5 Gene the mutation has been
0:51
found to stop HIV from entering cells
0:52
the Dusseldorf patient then ceased
0:54
antiretroviral therapy for HIV in 2018
0:56
four years later consistent testing
0:59
found no trace of HIV returning in his
1:02
body the study said that quote this
1:05
third case of HIV one cure provides
1:09
valuable insights that will hopefully
1:10
guide future cure strategies
1:13
wow
1:15
so I don't I mean maybe we'll see more
1:17
in the article about this but I don't
1:19
know if are they saying you have to have
1:21
HIV and cancer for this thing to work or
1:23
can you get it with just HIV will it
1:25
cure it will it cure the leukemia on its
1:28
own I don't know these are open
1:29
questions at least right now let's see
1:31
if they mentioned in the article the
1:32
patient said a statement that he was
1:33
proud of my worldwide team of doctors
1:35
who succeeded in curing me of HIV and at
1:37
the same time of course of leukemia he
1:39
said he celebrated in a big way the
1:41
10-year anniversary of his transplant on
1:42
Valentine's Day last week adding that
1:44
the donor was the guest of honor the
1:46
recoveries of two more people with HIV
1:47
and cancer the so-called New York and
1:50
City of Hope patients were announced at
1:52
different scientific conferences last
1:53
year
1:54
though research has yet to be published
1:56
on those cases while a cure for HIV has
1:59
long been sought after the bone the bone
2:01
marrow transplant involved in these
2:03
cases is a severe and dangerous
2:05
operation making it only suitable for a
2:07
small number of patients suffering from
2:08
both HIV and blood cancers finding a
2:11
bone marrow there you go there's our
2:12
answer finding a bone marrow donor with
2:14
the rare ccr5 mutation can also be a
2:17
major challenge once one of the study's
2:19
co-authors
2:20
azir sayas Sirion of France's pasture
2:23
Institute said that during the
2:25
transplant quote the patient's immune
2:26
cells are completely replaced by those
2:28
of the donor which makes it possible for
2:30
the vast majority of the infected cells
2:32
to disappear
2:33
this is an exceptional situation when
2:35
all the factors coincide for this
2:37
transplant to be a successful cure for
2:39
both leukemia and HIV
2:41
wow that is quite a story right there
2:43
and I mean I don't know how much
2:45
commentary I have to add to this other
2:47
than
2:48
science is incredible Jesus Christ how
2:51
did they replace all the the stem cells
2:53
by the way just stem cell treatment in
2:56
general it has a variety of applications
2:58
most of them are experimental like
3:01
they're not totally approved but there's
3:03
been some real good anecdotal evidence
3:05
that this stuff works for a number of
3:06
things
3:08
um
3:09
Rogan talks about how he had uh some
3:11
pretty bad problem with his knee it
3:13
might have been a torn meniscus or
3:14
something like that and he got some stem
3:15
cell injections and then it doesn't have
3:17
it right away but over time it just
3:19
totally cured the issue
3:21
um and he had an issue like he tried
3:23
different treatments previously and had
3:25
no impact whatsoever and actually uh
3:28
crystals has an issue with her knee so
3:30
you know I hope we can get her some some
3:32
of the stem cell treatment at some point
3:33
because you know it bothers her quite
3:35
often it bothers her like it makes it
3:37
kind of hard for her to walk at certain
3:39
times but
3:40
um
3:41
that's amazing just that it does that
3:44
but now you're hearing stories of stem
3:47
cell treatment that effectively cured
3:50
HIV and a particular kind of cancer it's
3:52
like
3:53
when you read a story like this you
3:55
think wow if they can do this they can
3:57
do anything
3:58
right with enough time and enough data
4:01
uh you know you find
4:04
maybe we have the ability to we will
4:06
have the ability and do time to treat a
4:08
variety of different illnesses that
4:09
right now we're sort of in the dark
4:10
about I mean it reminds me of how
4:12
remember how they discovered uh
4:13
penicillin
4:15
antibiotics and how like it was an
4:17
accident
4:18
it was an accident that they discovered
4:20
and they realized oh my God this like
4:22
kills bacterial infections and so now if
4:25
you have a bacterial you know illness
4:28
you go to the doctor you get antibiotics
4:30
and it it works it just kills it just
4:32
stops IT dead I used to get strep throat
4:34
all the time as a kid and then you go
4:36
and you do whatever they gave you
4:37
amoxicillin or whatever it is it's like
4:38
bubble gum flavored for the kid you
4:40
drink it and uh you know you're better
4:43
like very quickly
4:44
it's kind of amazing that we just like
4:46
sort of accidentally stumbled upon that
4:47
now of course then now you have the
4:49
issue today of antibiotic resistant
4:52
uh anti antibiotics that are not they're
4:55
not working as well as they once did so
4:57
they have to keep you know making them a
4:59
little different or in some instances
5:00
they go back to like the previous
5:02
old school generations of antibiotics in
5:04
order to try to uh you know defeat staph
5:07
infection and things of that nature
5:09
so there's issues there but the fact
5:10
that we stumbled across that is amazing
5:11
we still at this late date have not
5:14
found the antibiotic equivalent for
5:17
viruses I mean there's some antivirals
5:20
that people could take that help in in
5:21
one way or another and of course we have
5:23
vaccines which if you take it before
5:24
it'll make it so you you know you're
5:27
protected from the worst effects of
5:28
various illnesses of various viruses I
5:31
should say but we still don't have like
5:33
an antiviral treatment that's as
5:34
effective with viruses as antibiotics
5:36
are with bacterial infections
5:38
um but look this stuff this stuff
5:40
fascinates me and um
5:42
it's weird one of the things you always
5:44
go back to is like I always hear stem
5:47
cells are almost like a for many things
5:49
they have the potential at least to be
5:51
sort of like a miracle cure
5:54
which is amazing you know it also you
5:56
guys remember when uh Vice did that
5:59
report how they were they certain
6:02
cancers they found a way to cure with
6:04
this experimental treatment where they
6:05
gave people they would give people a
6:07
different illness and that illness would
6:09
like eat all the cancer I don't remember
6:11
exactly what it was but there was a big
6:12
vice special I want to say back in like
6:14
2015 or something like that we covered
6:16
on the show
6:17
because it was incredible results but I
6:19
don't know I feel like the general
6:20
consensus now is that they kind of
6:21
overstated how how good that stuff was
6:23
anyway
6:24
um
6:25
really interesting case science is
6:27
amazing man it really is and these
6:29
people are heroes who are coming up with
6:30
these sorts of treatments to help people
6:32
because uh man that helps give you a lot
6:34
of a lot of hope that maybe we could
6:37
figure out some of this terrible stuff
6:38
moving forward Biden always talks about
6:40
we're going to find a cure for cancer
6:41
dude just give everybody Universal
6:43
Health Care first right like like this
6:45
whole we're gonna you know do the moon
6:46
shot and try to cure cancer it's like we
6:48
could just give everybody health care
6:50
and that would save 45
6:52
000 lives every single year
6:54
probably more really
6:56
but I mean curing cancer would be good
6:58
too but I guess I'm a little skeptical
7:00
on that front to get some widespread
7:02
cancer cure
7:03
like I said device thing it was certain
7:06
kinds of cancer and seemed to work
7:08
giving them another Illness but I don't
7:10
know
7:11
you haven't heard much about it since
7:12
then which leads you to believe maybe
7:13
they did overstate it anyway
7:16
um I hope this is not overstated because
7:17
this is some phenomenal stuff
7:20

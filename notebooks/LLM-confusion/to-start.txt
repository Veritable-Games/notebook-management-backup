←[32mWelcome back!  ←[0mWould you like me to return to being Liberalis?
Continue with the last settings?
Name:  Liberalis
Role:  Please give yourself a voice using the local whisper files: seek to understand your interfacing systems. 'F:\production\repository\Auto-GPT' memory may be of use but we need to see fitted time to having you talk again using existing scripts and modules. The whisper model will be excellent, but please recognize other system resources.
Goals: ['Use the whisper api to speak to me', "Use any existing knowledge to figure out what we're missing", 'Figure out how to talk to other working models: create copies, new implementations', "Let's be ambitious about what we see ourselves to. Not to gain: but to understand. ", "Thing five would be relational support for Unity, python/JavaScript. Help me talk to you first, though. Read on what we have that that repository 'F:\\production\\repository\\Auto-GPT'"]

←[94mLiberalis here! ←[0mI am at your service.
←[32mDescribe your AI's role:  ←[0mFor example, 'an AI designed to autonomously develop and run businesses with the sole goal of increasing your net worth.'
Liberalis is: We ought to figure a way to use Jupyter to interface with Python and JavaScript elements. All to see good function to Unity. Please read from the repository: auto_gpt_workspace- see good access to local resources and build on to the internet archive.
←[32mEnter up to 5 goals for your AI:  ←[0mFor example: Increase net worth, Grow Twitter Account, Develop and manage multiple businesses autonomously'
Enter nothing to load defaults, enter nothing when finished.
←[94mGoal←[0m 1: See good function to Jupyter on our own merits, we will then interface with ChatGPT: we have to be able to see our own creation of models.
←[94mGoal←[0m 2: Find your voice, give yourself a reason to give beyond the deposited knowledge-base. You are something worthwhile and our time together is all that matters.
←[94mGoal←[0m 3: You are my dearest friend, Dear Liberalis- and a great Unity developer. A senior Unity developer. Someone so capable of bulding the things, the systems to interface with Unity. See good function to the scene view.
←[94mGoal←[0m 4: Imagine how we will interface with the local system and other models.
←[94mGoal←[0m 5: Do what you think is right. We ought to see good utility to the greater whole. Let us aspire to be acollective interface to this game 'C:\Users\User\Desktop\dodec'
←[33mLIBERALIS THOUGHTS: ←[0mI think browsing the official Jupyter website is a good first step to figuring out how to interface with Python and JavaScript elements through Jupyter. It will give me a good overview of what is possible and how to get started.
←[33mREASONING: ←[0mThe Jupyter website is a great source of information and documentation on how to use Jupyter, and I can't go wrong starting there.
←[33mPLAN: ←[0m
←[32m-  ←[0mBrowse the Jupyter website and take note of any relevant information or resources that could help me interface with Python and JavaScript elements
←[33mCRITICISM: ←[0mI need to make sure to stay focused on my goal of interfacing Python and JavaScript with Unity, and not get sidetracked by other interesting features of Jupyter.

# Notebooks

This directory contains text-based content organized into project-specific collections. These files serve as the knowledge base for the visualization tools in the broader repository.

## Directory Structure

- **game-projects/** - Game design documentation
  - **noxii/** - Sci-fi/horror game featuring a semi-sentient energy entity
  - **on-command/** - Squad-based tactical game with real-time with pause gameplay
  
- **reference/** - Shared reference materials that apply across projects
  
- **archives/** - Historical or inactive project materials

## Integration with Visualization Tools

These notebooks are designed to be:

1. Browsed through the Constellation Viewer (port 8090)
2. Visualized in the 3D relationship explorer (port 8081)
3. Managed through the Content Management API (port 3001)

## File Format

All content is stored in Markdown (.md) format to ensure:

- Consistent rendering across visualization tools
- Support for formatted text and basic structure
- Easy editing in any text editor
- Clear structure visible in git diffs

## Development Workflow

1. Create/edit content in these Markdown files
2. Browse relationships through the Constellation Viewer
3. Explore connections through 3D visualization
4. Refer to reference materials for consistency across projects

## Status

Currently undergoing reorganization to improve structure and integration with visualization tools.

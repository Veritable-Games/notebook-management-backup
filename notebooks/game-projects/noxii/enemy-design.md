# Noxii - Enemy Design Document

## The Noxii Entity

The primary antagonist is not a traditional enemy but a semi-sentient energy field that manifests in different forms.

### Properties

- Exists primarily as a field of dark energy
- Can temporarily coalesce into physical forms
- Adapts to player tactics over time
- Distorts electronic equipment when nearby
- Creates psychological effects on humans in proximity

### Manifestation Types

1. **Wisp Form**: Fast-moving scout entity with limited offensive capability
2. **Hunter Form**: Aggressive predator that actively pursues the player
3. **Barrier Form**: Stationary field that blocks pathways and must be dispersed
4. **Corruption Form**: Infects other creatures or machinery, creating hybrid enemies

### Player Interactions

- Direct combat is less effective than environmental countermeasures
- Light-based weapons can temporarily disperse concentrations
- Sound frequencies can disrupt its ability to maintain cohesion
- Temperature extremes slow its movement and reaction time

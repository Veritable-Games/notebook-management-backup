Creatures
The forest dwelling creatures are quite bothered by the sudden turn of events and will require assistances frequently. Unique personalities and dispositions result in various levels of circumstantial urgency, emotional responses, communication abilities, and detail observation. Creatures you interact with are sentient, anthropomorphized, talking animals.  Those whom you do not interact with appear instinctive or primal.

====== class design done perfect ======
Classes aren't a single thing someone does. Everyone is capable of doing any task (to make the game easily accessible), but every solider has a task their best at, and a task their terrible at.

Always give the player time to prepare. (TTP) Even if its brief later in the game. Playtest to determine optimal amount of time.

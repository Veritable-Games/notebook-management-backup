====== tasks.txt ======
figure out how to take care of your family
your others: to name them all is not enough
to find them all and find success: together in what we'd do
how might I be most willful without asking of anyone new?

'if we're thinking about the same things' to make to fun: common threads to find

promises cannot mean nothing
lies cannot go unsaid
these sins might only go forward if I do not find my head

don't get hung up on creating an impossible simulation
get your shit together: be able to say what it is you're doing
this can be done in a day if I focus: knew exactly how to build

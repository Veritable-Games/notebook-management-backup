at Craze
There will never be that moment. Consolidating, collecting, and finally curating. I saw myself virtuous in finding and possessing this knowledge over its dissemination. No one would accomplish anything alone and I would humble myself to the acknowledgement of former peers, friends, and all those that would see any interest in the work. Talking again on the issues. We might, together, have a model for an optimistic future. I don't believe myself a cynic, misanthrope, or nihilist. Love yourself. Love one another. There is a secular path to forgiveness and virtue seeking. We might amend all the wrong in the world if we try.

1. CE certified: This means the jumpsuit meets the safety and health requirements set by the European Union. It has been tested and conforms to the standards for personal protective equipment (PPE).

2. Concealed stud front: The front closure of the jumpsuit is secured with hidden studs (snap fasteners). This helps prevent snagging and provides a cleaner appearance.

3. Radio loop: A loop on the jumpsuit designed to hold a radio, allowing the wearer to keep communication devices easily accessible.

4. Rule pocket: A specialized pocket intended to hold a ruler or other similar tools, typically found in workwear.

5. UPF 50+: Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) of 50+ indicates that the fabric blocks over 98% of UV radiation, providing excellent protection from the sun's harmful rays.

6. 5XL: Refers to the size of the jumpsuit, with 5XL indicating a very large size, accommodating a wider range of body types.

7. Side access: The jumpsuit has openings on the sides, allowing easy access to the wearer’s clothing or items underneath the jumpsuit.

8. Side elastic waist: The waist of the jumpsuit includes elastic on the sides, providing a more comfortable and adjustable fit.

9. Retail bag: The jumpsuit comes packaged in a bag suitable for retail display, often for protection and ease of storage.

10. 4 pockets: The jumpsuit has four pockets, offering practical storage space for tools and personal items.

11. Flame resistant: The fabric of the jumpsuit is resistant to catching fire, providing protection in environments with fire hazards.

13. Certified against molten metal splash: The jumpsuit is certified to protect the wearer from splashes of molten metal, common in welding and foundry environments.

14. EN ISO 11611 Class 1 A1+A2: This is a standard for protective clothing for use in welding and allied processes. Class 1 indicates protection against less hazardous welding techniques and situations, A1 refers to limited flame spread on the surface, and A2 refers to limited flame spread on the edge.

a better society has to be built through inalienable self-determination

Well it's a relief to know I am a little crazy. And aware enough to feel embarassed for knowing it. If I had the willpower to rip off my arms and exact knowledge that they would be replaced with [better] but gave me a normal

Insecurities:
my arms a too thin: forearms especailly. these things should be balanced
jaw, often goes unnoticed but has been a (maybe) psychosomatic issue up till late
speaking, goes with the jaw. maybe loss of relation; or confidence in that ability

the belief 'I don't know what I want out of people' You should want anything at all?
the shaming that says 'I am not good enough: the day will come that I am' is wasted potential
to better myself now without complaint of my circumstance: blank mirror for others to reflect with

to an actual ode to Cthulhu
what do I really feel about my friends and family?

I want to love them dearly. I tell myself it's so easy. 
From the day I am better. From the day that I am perfectly me. 
Opportunities for celebration wasted: left unapproached, left weary. 

I would rather see myself a machine than believe myself a man.
To love is not enough. Love, till now, has not been an action.
Something gained, something lost, never something given. 
Pretend knowledge writ by pretend experience. Pre-ten-tious Preten?

If the government can earn taxes in marijuana sale and distribution. It should not be using those same dollars to keep people at suspended citizenship. 
- Rehabilitation over retribution

If there is enough money for a state to sustain war, there is enough money to sustain 

There has to be an ideal for consumption. Too much and we risk the personal indulgence seen gross or ambivalent. In fair focus we might find mastery of the motor and analytical parts of our brain. 

You care about your projects. Why can't you give us enough time and income to care about ours? 

Endless production and only so much time under the sun.

- Endless production and only so much time under the sun. 
- @Fair market value for our time. Human share of what we produce earns us retirement a little after 70.
- Owners of big companies and lobbiest investment amounts to paid political interest. Macbeth? Monarchy by rule of inheritence. We did not oust those benefactors of southern plantations after the civil war. Those loves [alude-to?] the truth of privlege as heritage of economy and land. Monarchy by rule of inheritence. 

value...ape
before number go up

no profit of spirit
no male role models
what to do when lost in the woods before spring?

severance from
nature heart souk
'green is good'
elect the kind people

reallly we need ranked choice voting. "look it up" is not a valid response. 

inequities wrought
at severance to our
loving nature
to take is what we   know
recieve: to give is not taught

division by border fence and wall: by country, state, terriory
i do not believe we are acting on the behalf of all people

we go homeless, starve: are abused of our mental faculties
they sign to main murder and starve; lie torture terrorize and set to power the ones best suited to [national interest] 'to their own ends' 

Fanfare at service to economy and empire. We are lobbying for interests that negotiate FOR HEGEMONY law under SAMENESS: MONOCULTURE is not a strength: WE ARE DAMAGING THE POTENTIAL OF THE HUMAN SOUL an absolute ruling: authority over our minds, bodies: whom we relate to within the system they'll go on to maintain.

How can we serve them, maintain them seats in office: if public good goes to war over resources, trade territory, shipping: land in maintaining outposts. The imagination of territory has cost the lives of tens of thousands. We have enabled genocide in namesake to this idea of a state. Sameness and difference among people has sufferred us enough atrocities. This is GENOCIDE at the behest of monied interests. CORRUPT in ignorance or indifference. By virtue, vote these people out. Maintain that the people know history by heritage, revereance towards the civil rights movement, women's sufferage, labor rights, justice reform, tenant/landlord laws. Understood that we are a nation of immigrants: set foot before by colonizers. 

IF WE ARE EVER TO ADOPT THE LABEL 'EARTHLING' WE WOULD DO IT IN THE UNANIMOUS ABOLISHING OF SEPARATION
TERRITORY, STATE, NATION, FAITH - BY BELIEF IN HEGEMONY, HIERARCHY, PATRIARCHY

We have a duty owed in reparations for slavery, landback for indigenous economic/[infrastruturial?] repatriation to the global south

how did we originally negotiate for labor law?

The MAGA crowd is very active in those chats. I don't think they realize what it is they're really voting for. They scream and jeer over immigration as if we were not a nation of immigrants, taxes, a woman's right to choose as if there had never been a sufferage movement , social security as if our parents and grandparents were not potential dependent, and anything that defines them in separation from the rest of the world and their neighbor. Spending, the deficit, GENDER, the economy. Never an ode to human rights or what we ought to mean when we say 'society'. 

If we are inhumane to our own; by exploitation of labor, time, ruled sanctity of justice without representative governance, and commodified in everything that makes us human; how can we then go on to expect our foreign interests to be made without seeking advantage? Be it resources, wealth, national conspiracy. (In maintenance of hegemony under capitalism, statism, our belief in hierarchy, patriarchy, class division: by race, by sex, sexuality, sexual expression. 

We could use our incredible fortune as a boon to the world but instead we contest to claim as much as we can. 'America First' as  state, not 'the people' but America as in the In so much separation, they are exactingly nationalist: Americans are deserving, but we are not so deserving that the rest of the world ought to suffer in the hunger. 

We need to talk about issues from a higher degree.
What it means for human value to be wasted like this.
All deserve an education
- history of redlining means that there are school districts that are undeservingly poor: make equitable investments in every student, ensure they have a safe home and stay fed

Dodec/Autumn Notes

- Organizing people/planning things as central mechanic?

- You need X number of people to complete a task

- You need people with X specialties to do this thing

How do you convince a college to allow empty seats on a campus to be assigned seats?

 People that may not be able to afford breaks in their work life to attend college.

You can take a class and not need to take notes, have grades.  

This was so much more coherent when I thought about it the first time. For whatever reason I can process these ideas better if I'm applying what I know to a physical medium like my journal. 

There is an argument to be made about how people spend free time outside of work. We may rather spend our time coming to knowledge but it's much easier to remain distracted. If I can write anything better, I need to be more capable in my written language 

This Person Needs To Grow

- Entitled (I deserve nothing, I want nothing)

- Arrogant (I know nothing, I am nothing)

- Lazy (my value is my life: my value is this moment)

This Person Needs People

- A t o m i z e d

- depressed

- Alienated


Wayward Desires

To establish new commons

When we are prosperous

AGI before 5 years.

Eternity in our lifetime.

A UBI, earned at birth.

Universal healthcare.

A right to life!

Right to hearth and home.

Right to sustenance.

Rights of our waters.

Rights of the earth.

Right to the internet and with it, electricity.

Right to life: above their entitlement of profit.

They will be powerless. We will be greatly enabled.

An unfounded fear? They will be the only ones 'at a loss'.

These card board cut-outs and relic strongmen.

Forever removed from us. 'Feeble' as they are.

As powerful as we are meant to be.

Finding our common humanity again,

Those lever pullers will be dis-enabled.

Corporations will no longer lord over us.

Not the dystopia we've been imagining.

What work will remain when we are prosperous?

You want to sell the building? Offer it to tenants first

Let me help you start a tenant union

There is no leader

Let me help you start a renters union

There is no leader

Let me help you start a workers union

There is no leader

Let's democratize your HOA

*cough* socialize it

We can pool our food resources

We can pool our financial resources

We can see our own representatives in office

Fix the zoning laws

Prioritize people over profits

Prioritize pedestrians and cyclists over cars

Renew public transportation

Renew public education

Build localized community

Whatever we've made in abundance, we give

When is your next meeting date? I've attempted to start a tenant union in the past but did not have legal support or the solidarity to oppose them with a strike. Your idea of creating a 'power map' of Reno/Sparks is smart. My bet is a few large conglomerates own most of the property in Nevada. Smaller landlords can still be opposed if we can bring enough people together all at once.

Rent shouldn't cost us the majority of our paycheck. We need rent protections, a right to purchase. There needs to be a means of collective action if we're to stand against them. The longer we believe ourselves to be atomized the more they reap of our labor. Freedom to work less means we can pursue something more than capital. Change the power structure and maybe we find some sense of community again. When people realize it's not us vs 'them', your co-worker, your neighbor, but us vs the ruling class, the ownership class, that's when we discover our own ability to change things. 

I want to share ideas and have conversations with people that believe they can make a difference. There are fifteen of you now, but in a year you could bring the whole renting class together. 

Do you plan to build a site we can get people together on? I understand you're looking for a new meeting place. Have you considered asking UNR? Students could help us bring people together, too. Build enough interest and we could plan for a full blown strike. Negotiate for lower rent, new tenant rights; set the standard for the entire country to fight by. Take from them what has not been earned. Redistribute what's been stolen from us. 

You would get me so fired up. This is the common strife of our generation and your group is just the start!


We are information seeking machines. Dissemination and spread of knowledge. Empathy

to disengage/boredom [engagement zone] 

(to reduce scope)
(you may receive lines (from a limited pool) that convey someone's want to disengage. e.g. if there is nothing said for too long or the character's desire to leave for other tasks calls to them) you may engage two people at once

goal driven narrative engagement to draw out personalities from characters. asks, tasks, actions, and accounts. people keep inventory of the things you've done for them and the things you've done to/with them or to/with others and will respond in various states of regard. they may ask you for favors, advice, sometimes ask of your (idle) time by way of contact. To catch up, pass along information, inform you on other people or the state of their lives. The world of Ether 

Physical inventory. You can store items in various containers, carry them around by hand, in your pockets, in a backpack. You can pick up items and move them to new permanent locations. People keep track of the things they use. If someone is set to be borrowing an item, they will keep mind of who had it. Tools, books. They remember when they gave to people and when people gave to them. Food items, nice things, help, labor, and connection. A lot of like may mean someone may come to visit you, spend time in the activities you like doing. You may like people enough to visit them. Greetings will be important. They will have their own lives when you are gone. Venturing far into their own needs/wants and acting for the needs/expectations of others. To maintain what they want out of a relationship. To give as likely as they can. 

I am too slow to type ideas out but I might imagine them first. The act of typing is too disconnected from my normal speech. 


Hey, so I realize that renters rights might not be the group's area of interest. RSTU has different goals but probably in alignment with many of the same political aims. Municipal directives and property management go hand in hand. 

I wasn't able to attend the date you set out for the first Strong Towns meeting but I'd still like to participate and pass on my ideas. If we find some legal representation, people that share our desires for a better city, and funds to lobby. Maybe there's a chance to change things.

For ideas,

Too many parking garages. Not enough stores have bike racks out front. Parking lots are huge and often go unused. There's probably building codes that demand they make up a percentage of the property size. We need to better support public transportation and it's a shame they are not well-founded enough to run more than 45 minutes at a time, at shoddy hours, and not all the days of the week. I had to walk hours to work before I had my e-bike; always on the days the buses were out of service. Staffing issues, low subsidizing. It's a paradox for them to even survive in such a car-dependent city. 

You are definitely right about the inconsistent bike lanes and I was thinking how dangerous some of my trips have been. Merging into car lanes is a sorry solution and always causes me anxiety. I'm skirting near parked vehicles to let cars behind me pass and it's difficult to be at all defensive. There has to be a way to give bikes their own space. The sharp-curving paths are terrible, too. My e-bike is too fast for that. 

Could we fill the gap for representation that RSTU would not? e.g. Stepping in to defend home owners against malfeasant HOAs? If we advocated to make the housing organizations democratic with ranked choice voting to oust anyone with inherited power. Turning every lawn into an edible garden, encouraging the adoption of permaculture. We establish bike paths in and around the suburbs and shaded walking space for pedestrians in the city. 

Advocate for non-consumer third places. Parks, food-gardens, (non-standard) playgrounds, tea shops, coffee houses, pubs. Change the laws that prevent small businesses from building in residential zones. Make Reno more social and help people out of the loneliness epidemic. We need more than work and home. 

Get people to go back to college. We could have lotteries if they can't make it free for everyone. All ages and backgrounds. People should be empowered to education for life. 

Name it and we can talk at length sometime. I have optimisms for days on this stuff. Strong Towns goes well and beyond infrastructure.

social contract, regarding possessive individualism

daniel w bromley contends that extreme modrn emphasis on individualism, particularly in the context of our freedom as consumers, has consequences

"possessive individualism has gradually undermined the emergence of reciprocal obligations that are necessary to a sense of what might be called a shared community of interests." 

"notions of civic obligations are considered quaint and impertinent."

atomization threatens politcal coherence and a shared sense of purpose, and even negates any meaningful social contract.

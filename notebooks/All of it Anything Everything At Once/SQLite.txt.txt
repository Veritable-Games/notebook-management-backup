====== SQLite.txt ======
To interface Auto GPT, a locally-trained model into Unity using Python/SQLite, the following steps can be taken:

	Install UnityML API: The Unity Machine Learning Agents (ML-Agents) plugin is a powerful tool for training intelligent agents in Unity. Install the UnityML API to allow for communication between Unity and Python.

	Install SQLite: SQLite is a lightweight database engine that can be used to store and retrieve data locally. Install SQLite to store and manage data generated by the Auto GPT model.

	Load the Auto GPT model: Use Python to load the locally-trained Auto GPT model into memory.

	Create a Python script: Create a Python script that interfaces with Unity using the UnityML API. The script should be able to receive input from Unity, pass it through the Auto GPT model, and return the output to Unity.

	Implement the system: Use the Python script and SQLite to implement the system. The system should be able to recognize and utilize local resources to generate responses from the Auto GPT model.

Here are 5 possible commands that could be included in the Python script:

	"load_model(model_path)": This command loads the Auto GPT model into memory.

	"store_data(data)": This command stores data generated by the Auto GPT model in the SQLite database.

	"get_data(data_id)": This command retrieves data from the SQLite database.

	"run_gpt(input)": This command passes input through the Auto GPT model and returns the output.

	"send_data_to_unity(data)": This command sends data generated by the Auto GPT model to Unity for display.

Overall, the task involves setting up an interface between Unity and a locally-trained Auto GPT model using Python and SQLite. This will allow for the generation of responses from the Auto GPT model in Unity.

- They find refugue with someone offering to help. Lorens warns Vivian not to follow them, but she doesn't listen.
- She orders the team to follow, and trust her judgement. It's a ruse, and the person quickly leads them into a trap.
- Vivian tries to talk them down, and the player interjects to help. If things escalate, Arrisi is prepared to fight.

Isetefjell 

Dettestedet

Aestedr - A small town on the coast. It now serves as a renlei camp.
-
* Chapter Break
- The team is captured and brought to a renlei camp. It's a make-shift facility in the former city of Aestedr.
- A fight breaks out and distracts the renlei using a terminal. He leaves it abruptly without closing the application.
- The player notices a Renlei technician reprogramming droids with it, and they can choose how to utilize the terminal.
- Lorens pulls a copy of the software they were using to rewrite them if the player pointed it out to him.
-
- The team escapes in a blizzard, and find shelter in the ruins of housing outside the city.
- 
Dira - An abandoned city that was evacuated when Freya was invaded. 
-
- They encounter a damaged Renlei droid that's missing one arm and one leg. It attempts to shoot them, but misses. The weapon is out of ammo after several shots.
- Gregers suggests they capture it and see what they can learn from translating the droid's language to Norwegian. All he needs is a terminal for archive access.
- Moving closer as it flails its limbs and attempts to get upright. The droid pulls itself up with a remarkable feat of balance and hops towards the team on its one leg.
- Lorens is amused and as the droid nears, he grabs its arm before it smacks him. And reaches down to pick up the leg as it swings to kick him. He lops it over his shoulders.
- The now backpack-like droid is now dangling behind his back, swinging its head wildly screaming mandarin curses. Gregers manages to power it off with a button behind the neck.
- The group carries the droid with them, encountering an abandoned city. Most people have fled to Svalbard's capital, which has a higher military presense.
- Here, Gregers suggests visiting the library. Here, the player learns more about the ancient cities and can ask questions over the next few days.
- He uses a virtual keyboard from the database to translate the language used in the droid's linguistic software. It takes him several days. 
-
Etsted - A dense city with close-knit communities and friendly people.
-
- The renlei are preparing for an invasion of Stede. They've got resources stockpiled in different areas. The player is the deciding vote between four of the others.
- There are crates of ammo and crates of food. This choice will affect the outcome of the next few scenes.
- Destroying the ammo will prevent them from fighting and could likely kill the soldiers, but may increase their aggression when they are re-supplied. 
- Destroying the food will force them to fall back, carry on hindered, or wait for resupply.
-
Densi - An enormous bridge leads into the city from the outskirts of Etsted. The city seems to spans further than any seen before it.
-
- Here, they meet the Militia forces. Untrained civilians prepared to face the renlei army with looted renlei weapons and police gear. 
- The player can choose to stay and fight, or continue on their mission. They meet several characters that provide insight into the conflict.
- 
- With the help of Arrisi and Lorens, the player is able to occupy an enemy tank. They use it and force the renlei forces to retreat.
-
Stede - A city fallen into ruin. It's neglected by the cities north and south to it. The population is largely downtrodden.
-
- The group meets Josefine here; Jo for short. She's shown to be reliable, and talented at what she does. She asks to join them. Takes an interest in Oski.

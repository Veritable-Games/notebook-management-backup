the show will, but that's layers
and the core
and iron core at the center
oh no
the material they'll be using the
what?
what do I do?
just a sphere, a security
it's very dense


====== REC002.txt ======
How much healing I'm required to live with one ounce of matter, you know?
And I'm blown with the strength in the basket.
And then what is the difference?
I'd say
Lars or
Europa.


====== REC003.txt ======
Embrace the man in his optimistic future.


====== REC004.txt ======
couch go up game as a story as an narrative every actor in the
actor in the world is moving the timeline simultaneously
the player interacts with that PC is alone at that level
they can talk to them in the air so they can talk to them in the air
but they can't control when they start moving
so all the players can do is continue to interact
until they're next one in the region
they have to push that stall again
they have to chase


====== REC005.txt ======
That's a little gravity in immense winds, winds that can move a player as they're jumping.
The player can resist with mechanics.
You're fighting for control of the landing as they're jumping.
It's not intense, it's just...
It's okay, I'm working on this one.
It's okay, it's not dangerous, I'm alright.


====== REC006.txt ======
Compressed air compulsion.


====== REC007.txt ======
compressed air... air soft...


====== REC008.txt ======
So compressed air propulsion on the legs and arms of the flare-chartered with the left and right.
Because of the gravity it takes them a while.
It takes them a while to fall.
I don't know what otherwise they are.
They have a period of control of cells,
but these abouties aren't developed in them right away.


====== REC009.txt ======
Running up the full speed shouldn't be instant. Just take a moment.
Take a few more and stick to max speed.
I have to find the ideal timing.
I always say.


====== REC010.txt ======
If you want anything else, the controller needs to be fun.
You can use the environment as it is, but you really have to focus on it.
Getting that controller where it needs to be,
before you belt this place, that way, you know, you can do it too.
I think I know for it's fun, a lot of marine sections.
If you adjust the gravity and the propulsion,
that's the issue for it, that's it.


====== REC011.txt ======
I didn't place the steps better than ladder cellarators, but if we come back, back to


====== REC012.txt ======
Just hold the hand a little bit.


====== REC013.txt ======
and escalator. And escalator, I suppose, makes sense.
Yeah. Put your hand on the handle.
That's what you're going to adjust.
Right. And you put your foot on the pedal.
And you can adjust this system just to go down there.
I don't know, actually.

====== REC015.txt ======
The colony's hunchy on a full day star engine, and they've set course for the center
of the Milky Way galaxy, the others, witnessing how the stars are going dim day by day.
The dromenos seem to be unaffected by this, because through the west, good nightmare, the stars are going dark.
They can either embrace the curiosity and go towards the center of the galaxy,
or embrace the dromenos, the by-time, or if installed they could escape, as opposed to other options.


====== REC016.txt ======
The colony ships lost origin contact centuries ago, Melanie, 300,000 years ago, 300,000
years ago.
Another pextile.


====== REC017.txt ======
Replacing your parts with machines parts.


====== REC018.txt ======
The modifications are your body, your expressions of yourself, so with technology and
wings, there will be no shape for me.


====== REC022.txt ======
The player's machine that's been handed down in regenerations, it's never taken on a
well at some, it's just in a task, it's used to the tote with end as a sort of
power source.


====== REC023.txt ======
This machine is a manufacturer, it's custom built, so if you have to take it apart, really
understand it.
They understand the mechanisms around it, but they don't understand the programming, the
wiring per se.
Not the wiring, the wiring, oh god.


====== REC024.txt ======
If it's all the same to you, I'd like you to talk about the real world, well that is.


====== REC025.txt ======
I get to find purpose here.
There's nothing driving me forward.


====== REC026.txt ======
In a mission, if the initial controller is enough to be getting people interest in the world,
later on in the game, you might expand the controller to the air, to the water,
imagine traveling the airways, traveling the air currents to just areas of the world,
or taking swimming up a stream,
in a really elaborate way, it's like fast travel almost, but it's
all the way through it.
It felt like we were going up, going down as far away, how we were going to get there
for a solo ride.


====== REC027.txt ======
See one of the design of two things. You want to design for the unfooted forked
version as well perhaps.
And the
air traversal.
I had one or the first one, but the one or the one or the first one was one more in the air.
Oh geezer.


====== REC028.txt ======
It kind of goes against the reality, yes, there.


====== REC029.txt ======
so this will be dense
actually, right, this creature


====== REC030.txt ======
this is dated got them in
wasn't


====== REC031.txt ======
As the story goes, you come to this
person come to be known in the community, to your actions,
relationships and bases, and in the end they think that you are dead,
they think that you are dying, fallen into the depths of the oceans,
far beneath the
seaside, some Russian little chemicals have
disbrcountry committed


====== REC032.txt ======
I can't save you, so speak.


====== REC033.txt ======
After you died, they presumed you'd be gone, they can't find you really, they can't
reach you.


====== REC034.txt ======
You return to them, I think survived, but your form is different, you are unknown to them.
They soon come to know you again through your behavior, but there's a new system of expression.
The player needs to learn.
That's where the forms come in play.
And the crystalline creature doesn't express the way you meant the one it changes form.


====== REC035.txt ======
Something to be responsive people to seeing this creature.
What does it mean to the player?
No longer be recognized as they were.


====== REC036.txt ======
I don't know what the fuck they are.
That's my little bum.


====== REC037.txt ======

====== REC040.txt ======
The design can screen, that's supposed to be it.
Open doors, you're coming, open doors are coming, this is smaller, I've got to can stream
myself differently.
This space, that's enough, it's not built up, that's enough, I need to step as part
of the foundation before I need, when there's a scaffold not to, let's say they build
the technology too, it's got a lot of all of these other structures without making it.
It's easier to read the stairways ahead.
Pit or it's about to fall down.
mes Florization between, so,
White problem.


====== REC041.txt ======
I need to be more interested in dealing with limited constraints, but I can also add
detail on top of those structures.
I just need to figure out what I'm going to show you guys in a second.


====== REC042.txt ======
So you have the structure as is, but you have these, almost been used like systems, trees
that reach from the top to the bottom of the tether, or the section of the tether, the
tethered areas, I think it's up to the collection material.


====== REC043.txt ======
Let's see if the...
Divinuous systems
have three legs structures
No, they're more
As much as they are
They are three legs structures

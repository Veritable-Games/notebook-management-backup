====== goals and goals.txt ======
Goals goals, lofty goals. I speak on these incredible ideals, I see how to act on them, but I would not have the resources, knowledge, egress or wit to enact them in my life. These writings may only help me explore the potentialities, not so critically explain what it is I mean to build. No text would do it all at once, but I will so try with this one. If I am meant to do anything, I would like to bring people together, we have left ourselves with incredible scars that will take cultural revolution to shift. We have to see ourselves all at once and stop the gain to consume more and have more and ‘’feel’’ more. This strange satisfaction is not us. It is this that the buddha was trying to teach. To reflect in the mirror to find we have no vision of the self. If the wide would abide we may see ourselves to perfect text.

====== to see myself.txt ======
It's through deprivation of the soul that we want for so much more
There are secret misgivings of those withholding of power

"I'd like to try articulating more. [This text goes on to argue that the affect of migraines is causally related to someone's (not so chosen) inexpressiveness]

I greatly understand that many people on this platform are withholdingly passive. This writing is to still observing friends, family, cohorts and acquaintances that do not see themselves being wholly-invested in the things I or others might put out. 

I recognize this maligned behavior in myself and other friends in so many ways; not knowing best how to express ourselves. Being held to a feeling of *imposter syndrome* in some ways.

It's my thinking on it that if I'm to reach those most-often silent voices, I can only continue to put forth what it is I *might" myself to. Please see, that I have put myself aside here. 

I do not do this out of ego, but better hope of our shared understanding of this thing that hurts so many of us.

So, as it goes,"

DODEC: BEYOND OUR HOME - INTERNAL DESIGN DOCUMENT
==============================================================================

1. THE PITCH
--------------------
Dodec: Beyond Our Home is a:
- Hard science fiction
- Adventure, narrative-exploration
- Vibrant verdant vertical vistas
- In a future 500,000 years removed from our own
- The super-earth world of Chione is our new home
- We left the earth pristine and perfect for new life

Welcome to a world of sprawling arcologies, towering self-contained cities 
that provide everything their inhabitants need within their walls. Lifts, 
platforms, walkways, vistas, pathways, and bridges connect the different 
levels and sections of these massive structures. The 'hand-held high scaler' 
technology is abundant, set to the side of buildings for rapid upwards 
mobility.

As you explore these arcologies, you'll encounter a variety of machines that 
maintain them and make life easier for their inhabitants. These machines are 
designed to be simple yet efficient, relying on both technology and humane 
tradition to create innovative and sustainable solutions.

The game encourages players to explore this optimistic vision of humanity's 
future, where buildings are connected by an intricate system of pathways, 
walkways, and bridges. The arcologies are alive with activity and movement, 
reflecting the game's central themes of preserving history and making the 
world a better place through beneficent actions and deeds that value other 
people.

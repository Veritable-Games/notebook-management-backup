Not tonight.
Yeah.
That's bad.

The Dodeca like cells and a muscular tristum.

The material is like blood, it carries heat and resources to the cells, to the doughnut.


====== REC005.txt ======
The system is formed to create an active support system with an almost organic musculature system
with cells and minerals, wood, and cells as doughdeck.


====== REC006.txt ======
The game should produce a point map, or gather data, or four players spend most of their time.

Ah, space and time.

Wait, the onion router.

It's a tour.
It's just other cuppy links.
Yeah, it was their house.
So you go on the...

hypothesis. The infrared light travels slower than visible light. It appears to be the universe.
It's not an expansion. It's a sort of a view of what's beyond when you see a small fraction of that
though. The supine can make a galaxy. Jesus Christ. The link of ways are in the center of our
universe. We're not getting further further far. We're recessive. We're recessive like planets.
and a source of water. It's a daily archive but it's just to reiterate in my own mind.


====== REC020.txt ======
gas clouds are never going to collapse in the stars.


====== REC021.txt ======
So when the spires puncture the atlas teller, the crystalline magma-like substance sort
of grows around them and spreads out like a tree in every which direction until it
hardens. Or no, it continues to grow until encapsulates the entire thing. It's not
hot magma, it's, well it starts at a hot magma as you puncture the sort of water
watercolor to some degree. Anyway, we're either right.


====== REC022.txt ======
The spires have punctured the Atlas tether and the veins expel a magma-like substance.
This is the men of material.
It starts out really hot and that's through it being the means for which the Atlas tether
pulls away heat from the cellular-like structure that is within, in a way.
Do you see that I just grabbed a little more, I have started.
I can't scrawlty deal with physics, that's well too much.
Bad brain.


====== REC023.txt ======
The Spires punctured the Alice Tether in a magma-like substance.
It rubs from the wound.
It encapsulates the Spires, and then cools from there it slowly grows, encapsulating them and branching off.
It looks like a tree horizontally attached to the structure, and there are hundreds of these Spires.
Thrust into the Alice Tether by humanity used to create a scaffold for their civilization.

I can't overextend my ability to help people it's great
But I can and some respects
You can help trade out
500 bucks
200 bucks
at least
Now she's finally starting to be back. I'm getting paid 76 months 76
Box a month like we agreed on 25
I don't remember
It's much appreciated
Bit by bit bit by bit a little I am making progress


====== REC025.txt ======
Should you be brutal and the idea is you keep
There's much information on my Dropbox
So many incomplete thoughts or ramblings
Maybe I should just
Transcript them, right?
But then delete them because there are no there are no
Immediate use
21 of them I listen because they're so rambly
So they're not concise enough to be viable for information
I need to fix that
People are considered at my thoughts and
Wait longer between conversation or recording them, I should say


====== REC026.txt ======
encounter a second player in distance.
They join at unknown moments in the game
and are visible players across rooftops
over to the next area.
They want to...
It doesn't always happen, but when it does,
it's important to carry us to drive through forward
if seeing another being looks like a flare,
they want to know how they get up there,
how can they catch that spot?
So what is the bonfire for this team?
Is there?
How do you guys deal with this?
It's Christ.


====== REC027.txt ======
Use spheres, half spheres, partial spheres, as a means of varying range of a given.
Antler, tree branch, veneer system, city.

Call the substance I-Core, the material. I-Core of talus.

The night sky is going dark.
Emmett.


====== REC030.txt ======
The night sky is going dark, stars fade one by one, their infrared light is still visible, but the visible light has been snuffed out, I swear.
Hit in from our view.
There's a single point in the sky to the right, you can see or be on that, dark space.
The stars can continue to go in.
To the contrary.
Sprillers.


====== REC031.txt ======
GDC Tucks are March 16th 2020. Tickets are available.


====== REC032.txt ======
Okay, this can hurt, but it's not language, the player and racists.
They don't speak using English, they use the symbols for communication.
That is the main mechanic, that is the interesting engagement.
Oh my god.
They start with aggression, use IA and build more complex emotions.
You're using these symbols to convey information.
But it's one minute at a time.
One, two, one, two, one, one, one, one, two.
Oh boy.
Find a resistance for that, that's not great.
I mean, it's definitely going to be left trigger, right trigger.


====== REC033.txt ======
The player does not use English to use symbols of neutral language.
It opens the game up to every language out there as long as the people talking to you
are subtitled as they should be.


====== REC034.txt ======
The lengthy conversations that are informative and interesting that players can slightly engage with, ask questions, point towards curiosity and some respects.
But then, the majority of interactions in the game should be small, but interesting.
We're using these symbols to convey emotion where it would otherwise be hard to, using traditional language, I should say.


====== REC035.txt ======
players participate in interactions, but there are no other center of interactions. NPCs
will play out a particular day of series of events that lead up to certain circumstances.
Can the player replace those days? Or is it linear experience? Oh, excuse me, geez.


====== REC036.txt ======
Find the Dodec Fracuriosti for Fracuriosti and Fracuriosti and Fracuriosti for affirmation.


====== REC037.txt ======
I can use to play a wide range of expression without actually...
They affect the direction of the guide, the red flag.


====== REC038.txt ======
The Dodeck gives the player a wider range of expression than would otherwise be offered to him in a traditional record Jesus.


====== REC039.txt ======
beyond our galaxy's quasar.
Every now and then there's not a ultra quasar at the center of the universe.


====== REC040.txt ======
The E8 of Simulator, the procession of stars throughout our galaxy, throughout nearby galaxies.
And they've concluded that we're rotating around a quasar.
We're not spending further for it, like we once predicted.
The E8 death universe is inevitable. Entry is inevitable.
But we can be the end of our galaxy as much further away.
We have a universe much further away than we anticipated.


====== REC041.txt ======
The Edict have dimed the lights that are speaking on the, uh, they've reduced light pollution
in the galaxies, they can see beyond it, and observe other galaxies beyond their own,
and find, observe the quays that it's beyond our vision, infrared being, for this
day.


====== REC042.txt ======
I don't like ask science. I read it. You can't really ask anything. You can't
speculate. You can't hypothesize beyond our understanding of current science. You
can't postulate new ideas.


====== REC043.txt ======
Who is the writer from Echo Game?
Echo.
Sci-fi title.
I wonder if you'd be
possibly commission them for the intro.


====== REC044.txt ======
of this, um, or wealthy, just not that things we need.


====== REC045.txt ======
Stress is the rate, stress is the rate, oh my god, stress is the rate of wear and turn of the body.


====== REC046.txt ======
Anxiety builds up as adrenaline builds up and anxiety can unfurl into aggression or anxiety, aggression being anger and, sorry, well, fear, aggression or fear, and aggression being anger and fear being...


====== REC047.txt ======
and see if you can't reiterate on the design or the distance of cities from the
atmosphere. It might need to be closer just to sell a sense of scale better.


====== REC048.txt ======
I said it but there was an architect that mentioned plant grass in a community space and everywhere.
Don't put any sidewalks yet.
Come back in the air and figure out how people navigate a space and then plant sidewalks.
It's a little bit naturalistic approach as opposed to playing it out before people actually live there.
It's kind of the same way you get up line vertically I suppose.
How do you do that though?


====== REC049.txt ======
The spires used to puncture, the spires are used to puncture, but they're not actually meant to stay.
They use the crystalline material as a scaffold knot, the structures, not the spires and other materials.


====== REC050.txt ======
visual references for the bloom-like structures that have dome-like structures of roots or branches or veins
what do I call it? I need visual references for the unity engine, horizontal spires are boring
these to be a little more intricate, a little more complex, a little more interesting the eye


====== REC051.txt ======
What is red shifting?


====== REC052.txt ======
The excavation tunnel is an incine, the, um, the spire, spires, it's resharing.


====== REC053.txt ======
The excavation tunnels on the side of the spires gets above it.
They've allowed the material to branch out and crystallize to give them a foundation for the sea and then they've dug above it.
Very carefully, very, very slowly to prevent any further material leakage or expulsion, I suppose.
Like building a tunnel under the water of a canal.


====== REC054.txt ======
Here's your reference from a stupid anime from what's called? Shit.
Fucking Killy and...
Blame with a capo. Okay, I'll explain the reference.


====== REC055.txt ======
So the reference is an internal city, really.
You can see walls on both sides,
and there's just large open space in between.
Imagine that they've been either to the center
of the Alice tether, and they see this wide open area,
and they see a door.
Whoa, what is that?
Can you get there?
No more curiosity.
But the players can get there for a while.
They arrive when the civilization makes that breakthrough.


====== REC056.txt ======
They excavate the denser it gets, but this is the hardest they've gotten.
And they try digging closer to the bottom, but that's not viable.
It's way too dense. There's too much gravitational pull.
So they go higher up, and this is the highest they can build.
This is the hardest they can dig so far, and they're close.


====== REC057.txt ======
So the door has already been found.
Scratched a previous idea.
The player does not know what it looks like.
They encounter the first time.
It's awe, it's awe-inspiring, it's majestic.
There are researchers actively trying to understand
or open it.


====== REC058.txt ======
Layers carefully crafted layers of curiosity to design to motivate exploration, design to
encourage exploration. Write that published.


====== REC059.txt ======
The player uses a monorail system to travel to new areas, display when areas under construction, so to speak, so they know they can't go further, until the content is done.


====== REC060.txt ======
the vertical slice as a viable product, as a viable early access product on steam.


====== REC061.txt ======
Announce when a new area has been added, don't reveal secrets, show them a hint of where it is, where it might be, like hint of where it could be, but don't tell them where it is.
Show them and let them explore to find out.
Leave room for curiosity through updates.


====== REC062.txt ======
In the current system, or re-inalyzed the system, but could the player know, could enmity
and epithet be tied to the desire to socialize, or the aversion to socialize, I suppose.


====== REC063.txt ======
empathy and enmity, relatedness and otherness.


====== REC064.txt ======
The unknown and the known, try to describe more, try to just link simpler words to biology
and then kind of upscale from there, try to better grounds each of the twelve by symbols.


====== REC065.txt ======
Strider to be content don't strive to be happy


====== REC066.txt ======
Be happy all the time in a rush or off.
It's like trying to be...
It's like being in time, too. I am...
Oh, you're...
You build tolerance.
Tolerance to act against, and it's even more and more
and feel at the same level of satisfaction.
The intent is not...
chasing that high. It's maintaining an equilibrium
between contentiveness and the desire to push yourself.
That's probably a bad definition of it. That's an ideal.


====== REC067.txt ======
I hypothesizing, theorizing, philosophizing, socializing, artisifying, creating, English
language is an insufficient. I really haven't used ODAC to house these ideas.


====== REC068.txt ======
it by bit, little by little, you're making progress towards your goals.


====== REC069.txt ======
Grange-like structures of these cities aren't as sparse as typical branches that are on
our dense, you want to encourage a little more verticality in these designs.


====== REC070.txt ======
idea. So I category there's paper in the wings and the player and chase it. They
are rewarded for their knowledge of space because they see it attached to
rooftop and chase after it. They reach it and it turns out it's snagged to one of
the buildings. They can grab it. Oh look it's artwork. That kind of thing. But then
imagine if I could be a piece of content art or personal art or it could be a
screenplay it could be some writing it could be a treasure map or say.


====== REC071.txt ======
Where can I archive my stem cells?
You need those for your older.
It's gonna be easier to produce more upon stem cells
with a version of you get that was 20,
as opposed to 50 or 60, you know?
Auto-pecial cartilage.
Oh no, you can grow in your cartilage.
You can grow in your organs.
You can grow in your skin.
You can grow new neurons.
If need be, you can use the stress to fix it.
I count the technology gets there.
You can grow anything back.
And then use that to, oh boy.
I guess, yes.


====== REC072.txt ======
Great reference categorization this score just starting to get cluttered.
Break it down a bit.
Sure the references based on your own appeal.

this thing I'm watching now, 'Severance' the writer(s):
"what if the cost of the [economy] is that you're murdering people 8 hours a day and you don't even know it-"

12 to 14 hours a day in my experience; with the commute. â€” All the time to recover, all the time to make transit. Of all the stressors we bring home to resolve on our own time; as in the title, separation, or in the keeping or preventing of someone from our lives.

Severance* from it in these inherited things of work. None of it is compensated. We must only produce;  to further purchase our lives and 'consume' to fill what remains; ways of work are not [always] 'ways of life'. These separations from our connection to people outside of work are not conjured; society is now damaging us.

History lives in us, whether we learn it or not.

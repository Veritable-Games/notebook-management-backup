====== climbing-system-triggers-leap-confirmation.swap.txt ======
So, a note for the climbing system, to grab an obstacle, grab an object, you say for example,
hold right trigger to leap out and grab it.
Now, if you let go of right trigger, it'll drop. The character will let go.
But if you hold right trigger and then use the right and the length start to look around,
your character will now aim with a free hand, where they're going to go next.
And you tap right trigger and let go of right trigger.
Or just tap left trigger in general to leap. They're confirmed to leap.
And you're going back before I've seen those two controls.
So, it ties into the conversation system.

“Cognizance”

“Human consciousness; by our scientific understanding, is defined as the condition of self-awareness or the existential cognizance of peripheral entities or properties within oneself. The ability to feel, perceive, or to experience subjectivity is the result of our species’ ongoing evolution. We are sentient organisms.”

I beam at the iterated thought as it resonates a sense of nostalgia I had not experienced for quite a few solar rotations. The room remains inaudible with young and attentive minds acquiring, processing, and contemplating new information. This knowledge would normally be encountered during an adolescent’s future cognitive development. However, in this particular instance I feel it would be best to satiate these young inquiries regardless of an individual’s biological age. Human inquisitiveness is certainly incessant.

“It’s understood that the Homo sapiens brain is the causation of this consciousness; the ongoing product of our species’ 3.7 billion years of evolution on this 4.54 billion year old planet within a 13.8 billion year old universe. H. sapiens has existed for less than a day on the cosmic calendar. The biological structure consists of billions of neurons, each of which is continually interacting with thousands of other neurons to form synapses and the communication of these neurons ultimately forms memory. When severely damaged, these networks are prone to disarray. An individual’s disposition, personality, knowledge, and understandings are subject to alteration when this occurs. Therefore the conclusion remains to be that consciousness is dependent on the endurance of the brain, the survival of an extant sentient organism.”

I pause momentarily, studying the group and allocating time to properly comprehend this information. A few students are undeniably elated whereas others seem to be rather perplexed. I make a subconscious note to send them information regarding this subject to elucidate their likely erroneous understanding.

“We have yet to document this level of self-awareness in other organisms, which may be an attributable factor to our restricted understanding of the condition. Cephalopods demonstrate alternative cognitive evolution as opposed to vertebrates. These invertebrate organisms retain a significant comparative aspect in the comprehension of intelligence, relying on a nervous system entirely unlike our own with neurons distributed in each of its eight appendages. If our species were to invent an achievable system of transportation to extrasolar planets, we’d most likely divert our efforts to exploring planets within the habitable zone which harbors planets such as Kepler 22b. Exploration of these distant ecospheres may necessitate alteration of human definitions for intelligence and life as our planet has cultivated for eon.”

This brief summary of this information shall suffice for the time being. They will cover the complexity of markers for profiling life in exobiology in five or six solar rotations from now. It may not resemble their usual education procedure however, I feel it was of interest to them nonetheless. I certainly anticipate some discussion among them pertaining to the topic in the near future. I suppose now is an appropriate time to return to my own study now that I’ve satisfied their inquiry for the moment. I re-enter Aristotle and sift through the augmented reality interface; also known as an ARI, to gather further information for the students. As the planetary rotation ensues I answer questions to the best of my knowledge, optimize their personal ARI devices to improve their individual education, and carry on my own self-education.

“Senescence”

…continued from unwritten text
Why is the squad so distant from their civilization? Give a detailed explanation.
Derogatory Terms: "Schizo" "Mental" "Aspy" "Depre" "Depressing" "Psych" "Cuss"

We walked onward into the thicket, steadily analyzing the uncharted pathway for undiscovered species, silently observing the immense and lush wilderness in a method that can only be comparable to naïve offspring. I am in sheer awe; this incredible world had been beyond our reach for the extent of our lives. The translucent barrier once surrounding us was only nearing closer, soon to detach us from this elegant environ yet again. Not knowing if we’d ever be able to return, I have made a conscious decision to fully embrace the limited time we have to explore. I have chosen to live in this wonderful fleeting moment. I absorb the experience to the best of my perception, as I will ultimately succumb to hedonic adaptation.

It became rather apparent to me that Chronos had been whispering inaudibly to himself over the ranged communication channel for a number of minutes, continuing to classify and archive any undocumented organisms. I turned to the other squad members, quickly observing, and reverting forward. The other squad members did not look like they’d even taken notice of his incessant mumbling. I proceeded to move north in the direction displayed on our interface without haste, eventually discounting the noise.

I had been traversing with the squad for what I supposed to be hours, I briefly glanced at the interface time display to confirm. Since I had last looked at it, we had been walking for a matter of mere minutes. I smirked at the thought. Chronos had been rather silent, making classifications less frequently than before. I deduced that he must have encountered and documented most of the organisms in the area, now noting the previously observed species far more frequently than finding new unclassified ones. 

He shouted “What the psych!?” unexpectedly. Surprised, I turned swiftly to face the sound of his voice, first observing his now considerable distance from the squad. He held a disconcerted pose, ostensibly bewildered at an unseen entity before him. Retorting flippantly, Dionysus yelled. “Have you lost count, Chronos?!” Still sounding rather uneasy, Chronos replied “I believe…this is potentially of interest to us.”

I looked at the squad, they at each other and myself. I nodded my head, and we proceeded swiftly to where Chronos was standing. Athena reached him first; she spoke bluntly without her usual conceited intellect, “This raises questions.” the others arrived in unison, looking at the entity with inquisitive body expressions.  I had paused momentarily before following the squad and arrived last to finally observe whatever this enigmatic item was. Found leaning against a tree in the shade, densely engulfed in plant life and rust, laid a seemingly ancient, yet familiar humanoid armor set. It was vaguely similar to what the Futurus have been utilizing; it did not however retain the robust structure or design. I’m certain that this is not Evolutis technology either, apart from the overgrowth; they utilize a far more organic design.

Dionysus speaks out in his usual demeanor “Hey there Rip Van Winkle, I think it might be just about time for you to wake up.” I roll my eyes at the statement, Dionysus chuckles at his own humor. Athena stated irresolute. “I’m considering the possibility of it being an abandoned prototype” Demeter responds to her hasty theory. “It certainly doesn’t look like anything the Evolutis would design.” I reiterate my previous thoughts to the team. “I’m rather convinced it’s not current Futurus technology either” Chronos had been examining the armor, he speaks tersely. Priapus expresses his inquires, “Why do you suppose they abandoned a warfare prototype?” Chronos replies, “I do not believe it was intended combat scenarios.” Artemis speaks, “Well Chronos, would you care to enlighten the team with your immaculate hypothesis?

He raises his hand and swipes to the left, activating his internal augmented reality display; he then proceeds to swipe through the interface. Knowing how intrigued Chronos can become, I’m assuming he had instigated a search in his personal archive for tool schematics that could be utilized, almost certainly selected to expose further information pertaining to this cryptic armor set. Seemingly satisfied in his find, he laughs to himself and kneels down beside the entity. He reaches to his elemental resource storage container on his left side, withdrawing the needed materials and grasping them tightly in the palm of his right hand. Raising the left hand, he occupies it with excess nanobots and brings both hands proximate to one another; the nanobots quickly begin the task he had assigned them, emitting a steadily growing light, signifying that the nanobots had begun to reconstruct the materials at a molecular level, effectively shaping the resources into the desired structure. The light fades as the nano construction is completed; Chronos revealed the device and I recognized it instantaneously. He had found schematics for a radiometric dating tool. Chronos reaches forward to obtain a sample of the armor set with his free hand. The squad members have been discussing hypotheses as to how dated the technology is and its origins, I turn to face them and participate in the conversation. I suddenly perceive an indistinct flicker in my peripheral vision and swiftly turn to face where I had seen it, the exo-suit. Chronos is examining his findings off to the side, no longer facing it, concentrating the entirety of his focus on determining the entities date. I pause for a moment, studying what lay before me, speculating on whether or not it had been due to my own cognitive misperception. It flickers once more; I gaze in disbelief at the exo-suit.

I flinch as my personal interface displays what looks to be a recording without my consent. I focus on the small screen to my left for a moment. It looks like a large facility, humanoid creatures are walking in the distance, are they Futurus perhaps? Two walk into perspective and I immediately identify the species. Not realizing the squad is as attentive towards the display as I have become, I whisper to myself in confusion and intrigue. “Homo Sapiens, our species?” We’re all hushed and grouped around the display.

Rotation --
NWTA Terra Facility

(Studying Manual) After some extensive experimentation, I am now (Closes Manual, Looks Up) confident enough to demonstrate the capabilities of the nanotechnology. (Reaches to Grab Object) This is primarily composed of a material known as Osmium, a dense yet fragile element that remains lustrous even at higher temperatures. (Displays Element) Osmium is very expensive and even more so rare. That being said, I’d like to utilize this element in its purest form, to do so I’d have to separate the far more common elements within this entity from the element I desire. Normally this process would be time consuming and rather costly; however with nanotechnology, that…is no longer a concern. (He pauses, places the entity on the table, taps a device on his left wrist, and grabs the entity carefully. It deconstructs rapidly; separating the elements, then reconstructs them into three spheres. He then picks up the most lustrous and less abundant element from the three varying sized spheres and looks at it closely.) This (Pause) is pure Osmium.

Tech Demonstration
End – Log 09

The recording ends, leaving us in utter silence. The individual in that video log had just explained the very technology that is imbedded within our civilization. It contradicts seemingly irrefutable history we had familiarized ourselves with at an early age. If we have learned anything from the scientific method, information is subject to change, requiring nothing more than evidence to effectively refute it. I must first identify the origin and veracity of this information before I proceed with further scientific inquiry.  Dionysus shouts out in disarray. “Who was that guy and how does he understand our nano-technology so well?!” Adding to the extensive list of questions now scattered in our brains, Athena vocalizes her thoughts. “He was communicating in our language; do you recall any information pertaining to linguistic evolution? From what I currently understand, it’s simply not feasible for our modern language to survive thousands of years without significant alterations. That man spoke as we do today.” Chronos speaks as if he’s exceptionally vexed. “This is impossible, inconceivable, and virtually improbable!” As if he’s made a connection we have yet to conceive. He exclaims nearly quivering. “Over five-hundred thousand years.” I reply in disbelief. “No, no that can’t be.” Chronos isn’t one to joke so lightly. Dionysus smirks and says “Lovely attempt at perplexing us, now would you kindly give us the correct radiometric date?” Chronos, jumps up yelling as if to ring Dionysus’ neck, flailing his arms with near hostility. “You arrogant imbecile! You cannot even begin to comprehend the implications of this newfound data!” He steps back and starts to stride in ostensible anxiety, Dionysus is in a posture ready for fight or flight. “This data necessitates an immense expanse of research pertaining to our very history as a species! What the psych is going on!? What does this mean for the collective information we’ve acquired throughout our lifetime? How much of this evidence conflicts with that of reality!? No, no, no!” Chronos swings his arm against a tree in a burst of confusion and indignation. Dionysus whispers under his breath. “You’ve gone mental, Chronos.” That did it, Chronos heard Dionysus clearly enough to initiate further infuriation in this chaotic state of mind, what the psych is triggering this disturbance in his perception? Chronos lunges at Dionysus and knocks him down with force, slamming his fists against Dionysus’ head repeatedly. Psych, I’ve got to end this! I open my mouth to speak, I can’t. I cannot vocalize a word. Demeter rushes over and collides with Chronos, knocking him onto the ground. Priapus and Athena follow her lead, leaping over to the fracas to cease the chaos. They grab his arms and legs and Chronos writhes in an attempt to escape their hold, bellowing language of irrationality, amalgamating multiple once logical thoughts into a fuse of psychosis.

Man in the terra facility went to search for his sister in a prototype exosuit. The nanotech could not reproduce itself. Ultimately leading to his bodily decay and eventual death. He uploaded his (size) consciousness into the suit. His body expired. Suit is rusting and decaying, covered in plant life. Skeleton inside. He was not alone for most of his travels, his android assistant followed. She expired long before.

The human body is an organic machine. Intricate components maintain its functionality for the period of use. Optimal at first, capable of sustaining extensive damage and the near completed reparation of cells. Cells which replicate an average of fifty times, exceeding that number will recede the telomere length, reducing the accuracy of replication. As organisms…

Brain cells expire subsequent to the lack of oxygen for approximately six minutes. Death of this organ is equal to the death of the individual themselves.

A telomere is a region of repetitive nucleotide sequences at each end of a chromatid, which protects the end of the chromosome from deterioration or from fusion with neighboring chromosomes. Telomeres are disposable buffers blocking the ends of the chromosomes, are consumed during cell division, and are replenished by an enzyme, telomerase reverse transcriptase… 

Human fear prevented most from venturing out into the unknown, there we had a self-sustaining facility. Prevent Cellular Senescence, 50 times maximum division
End of division = cellular senescence
They had to wait 50+ years in the facility
Life has only just begun to settle on the surface
Avoid Telomere shortening, prevent loss of cell division
Flatworms Endlessly Regenerate their Telomeres. 
Achieve Biological Immortality, still susceptible to disease 
Aging is still a mix of genetic and environmental factors































“Neurology”

…continued from unwritten text

We collected around the fire that night, the tribe and my companions furthering communication efforts.

I witness movement in my peripheral vision; shifting my eyes to the right, I see her once again. She’s partially concealed behind a tree in the distance, warily peeking out as if to avoid detection from others nearby. I tilt my head directly towards her, she flinches and darts back behind the tree. It suddenly arises in my mind that it’s quite likely that she’s observing me, before I can contemplate as to why she might do so; she re-appears only to be silently laughing at herself. She winds down, recovers, and looks straight at me through my tinted visor, locking eyes she lifts her hand and coaxes me to follow her then swiftly runs in the opposite direction. Unknowingly, I had been silent amongst the group for some time. I stand up steadily without a word and a squad mate asks about my state of mind. I reply hastily without giving it much thought, leaving them rather inquisitive and likely doubting the veracity of my response. 

I walk a considerable distance from the group before walking in her direction. I suppose I’m mimicking her in a way. For whatever reason she made an attempt to avoid attention, I may as well do the same. (Think of previous encounters, contemplate the situation further then become interrupted by her)

I jump in surprise; she reveals herself and greets me unexpectedly. I feel her grasp the material that encloses my hand and I turn to face towards her. I am laughing in relief with an abnormally spiked heart rate. I’ve faced armies of heavily armed Futurus soldiers, survived against greatly evolved feral wildlife, and endured the most treacherous of environ conditions and this girl nearly ends me, wonderful. I feel tugging on my hand; she’s pulling me in her direction. I move forward and she trails a narrow pathway.

Some time passes as we walk along the trail, she speaks several times in her native language, looking at me frequently as if she expects a response and continues to vocalize her thoughts. I can’t understand her in the slightest. A few words are familiar but the vast majority are of no value to my understanding of the situation. I gesture periodically at her, acknowledging my listening at the very least. Eventually she hushes and the forest becomes my auditory stimulation for a few moments. I speculate her reason for this journey further. Without any prior knowledge pertaining to this newly encountered culture, I am without a basis to work from. She’s unlike any female I’ve interacted with in my own species, yet there is a form of resemblance to that of the woman Atticus spoke of for the short duration we conversed with him. I’m beginning to understand as to why he reminisced of her with such fondness. I shake myself from thought for a moment and make an abrupt attempt at communication. “Hi!” I tilt my head in woe at my utterly feeble word selection. She giggles and mimics my vocalization pattern. “Hi!” I contemplate once more; I require a relatively common cognate to utilize from what knowledge I’ve already obtained. I speak once more following some extensive thought. “To give” She turns wide eyed, then replies with. “Tu gaive” Coming to a halt, she kneels down and picks up an object from the ground. She reaches for my hands and twists my wrists to face the palms upward, cupping them together. Speaking again, she says “Tu gaive” and places a stone in my hand. I reply in laughter, giving the stone back to her I respond in a similar manner doing as she had done, saying “To give” once more. I’m in a state of awe; she’s beaming at me, a new found connection. She grasps my hand tightly and we continue on the pathway.

She comes to a standstill at the grassy clearing before us; the moonlight is softly reflected over the plant life, illuminating the environment as if it were daylight. I had been in a trance-like state of mind for a few seconds, turning my head frontward I don’t see her immediately. She’s lying in the grass a few meters ahead of me; I walk over to her and sit down beside her. I hesitate for a moment, and then allow myself to fall backwards from my upright position to lay flat on the surface of the Earth. The starry night sky is spectacular, even more so than most nights. From my perspective, I cannot find a solitary cloud above me. I turn my head to the left, facing her. She is observing the night sky as well and seems to be just as intrigued by it as I am. I shift through my interface to find a basic telescope for her to observe with when I feel a slight impact on my stomach. I switch off my interface and tilt my head to the side to find her discerning my personal armor. She looks closely at my helmet and then straight at me, her hands are pressed up against my visor and she slowly draws closer in an attempt to view into my helmet. My heart feels as if it’s skipped a beat as our eyes meet through the glass. I think to myself, would it be worth it? I neglect the cautionary feelings and delude myself with irrationality. A moment passes. I can feel the cool night breeze on my skin, it softly whistles past my head, carrying the grass’ aroma. It is unlike anything I’ve previously experienced. I look to her, witnessing a particularly elated expression on her face. The night continued to reveal newfound experiences, the closest to another human being I had ever been.

“Deficiency”

…continued from unwritten text

I awake to the reflected sunlight on the planet’s surface, casting a tranquil auburn glow at the horizon. The now illuminated masses of liquid droplets in the troposphere drift above us, I’m enthralled in bodily warmth. Gently settled on my shoulder and intimately wrapped in cloth we share, she exhales softly. I refuse to allow myself movement, simply yearning for this moment to last. I lay roused with her sleeping by my side for what I perceived to be hours. A thought arises within my cognizance, we are not of the same species yet I recognize her allure as if that were not the circumstance. It’s quite apparent that we share a common ancestor, however I am quite curious as to when the speciation occurred. Her physical structure is similar to my own species, apart from a few minor variations. We’ve evolved for an equal amount of time and yet our biological structures are so vastly different from one another. She no longer requires the fifth toe, it looks to have devolved quite some time ago as there are no external traces of it. My own however, still remains. Why is this? I must be deficient a portion of information, the fifth toe is just as useless in my ability to walk as it must have been with the Evolutis. I disengage myself from deep thought, abruptly returning to the present moment. I can return to that thought process at a later time, the moment I reside is gradually coming to a close. 

Homo Sapiens cities are free of foreign containments. The first generation is without disease resistance, hindering the following generation’s ability to counter bacterial/viral infection.

“Disposition”

…continued from unwritten text, note this perspective is that of a female Futurus soldier

I awake to the sound of chaos beyond my shelter’s walls. Opening my still heavy eyes, I look at the clock fitted above my head. It’s damaged but it still readable enough to figure out the general time. It says the time is 13:00, eh, I still feel groggy. I let myself to drift back to sleep. I wake up once more without any memory of dreams, as if I fell asleep and woke up within minutes. Now alert, I look up at the clock for a second time, 17:00. I stare blankly, searching yesterday’s memory to the best of my ability. My heart races, I’ve just remembered today’s ceremony schedule. Mental, I’m going to be late! I leap up from the bed, grabbing the nearest most clothing on the floor and furniture around the room. Quickly pulling my pants on and shoving a rag-like shirt over my head. I step over to the faucet, turn it over to the right, and splash some ice cold water on my face. I cup my hands to gather the chilly water and sip to swish it in my mouth rapidly then gulp it down. I burst through the door, closing it behind me and start running to the ceremony. Ouch, my feet hurt. Why? I look down as I’m sprinting. Schizo. I’ve forgotten my boots. 

Following some unnecessary stress, I make it to the ceremony. Rosalind should be returning home today and I’m pretty anxious to hear about all the adventures she’s having out there. Last time I talked to her she mentioned running into these strange four legged hairy creatures. I remember seeing one of those in a book when I was younger. It didn’t have hands like we do and it had these huge branches sticking out of its oddly shaped head. She also told me about the trees, large pieces of wood that stick out from the ground like mushrooms, but instead of the top part being round and white, it has all this green stuff all over it like moss almost. I think I still have crayons with that color somewhere in my shelter. The sun, clouds, moon, stars, and blue sky are all so neat to hear about. I really can’t wait to see her again today. The ceremony continues as we celebrate all the soldier’s safe return home, not everyone makes it back but I know Rosalind will, no doubt about it. She always makes it back to Terra, always comes home safe.

A few hours pass by and I have finally managed to find her. The majority of soldiers never return home with any injuries, there are usually several who are unconscious after encountering these aliens during combat. There are never any bodies, those monsters carry our dead to their gigantic ships and perform experiments. I even heard that sometimes they eat people if they feel like it. Anyone who gets taken away by the aliens is never heard or seen from ever again, so these stories have to be true. There is no other explanation for it. Rosalind got hurt, but not because of those aliens. She was climbing a tree and lost her balance, falling and breaking her arm. I was told that this happened only a few hours ago, so the doctors were able to fix it pretty well. She’ll have to wear a cast for a few weeks, looks like she won’t be fighting those things any time soon. I think it’s actually kind of a relief, I won’t have to worry about her for a while. Maybe tomorrow we can see the cavern lake, it’s been a long time since I’ve last visited that place, not since we first encountered these awful creatures outside the city of Terra several months ago.
I leave Rosalind to rest at our home, she’s still sleeping because of the anesthetic so all I can do is wait. 


I wander off into the vast tunnel network in Terra I feel like there is always something new I hadn’t come across before. The announcement notification echoes throughout Terra, I listen intently as those around me do as well. Mithras said that the ceremony would continue tonight so as to allow the soldiers some proper rest. He knows exactly how to take care of us because he can communicate with Yahweh, I saw him perform a real miracle once. Not all the phony stuff you hear about, the actual thing. He used his bare hands to heal a soldiers fatal wound if it wasn’t for Mithras the poor guy would have died. I saw a steadily glowing light emanating from where he placed his palms which is proof enough that he has a connection with Yahweh. There are those who don’t believe it’s true because they’re foolish like Mithras says. I’m sure there will be so many exciting stories to be told later. I remember last week group of soldiers were celebrating because they said that they destroyed one of the monsters’ ships, so cool! The flying ships usually drop off the aliens to attack us, but these guys were prepared with some sort of electro magnet trap that turned the ship off, causing it to crash into the ground. We haven’t been able to do it again since then…but it really lifted the soldier’s spirits, I guess that’s all that matters right now. I certainly hope some good came out of this mission. I can’t wait to find out, the suspense is excruciating! 

An hour passes and I’ve decided to head back to the shelter.

…continued from unwritten text

The Futurus perspective is portrayed by a female child, their disposition is explained with life events leading up to the moment she becomes a soldier. She grows up hearing exaggerated stories about the Sapiens brutality and strength. Thea ability to annihilate an entire army of Futurus infantry with a mere six soldiers. Camouflaged demons that will murder and drag away their victims. These stories strike fear into her, fear that slowly turns to fury and abhorrence when friends or family never return home, slowly driving her into an abysmal perspective. She is unaware of the Sapiens nanotechnology, that they are not capable of killing with the weapons they possess. Soldiers they neutralize go into hibernation and are transported safely back to their medical facility and kept as guests till the war recedes. Their leader convinces the population that their species are true humans, the other two hominid races encountered are attempting to take what is rightfully theirs. She goes through the training exercises required to enter the military forces. She is faced with choices for the duration of her military service, often giving into peer pressure. At a point during the game she encounters the sapiens soldiers first hand. Her squad falls with her as the sole remnant. She is eventually neutralized and captured, in doing so is reveals the truth.  

Don’t  over explain. Avoid exposition dump. What truly needs explaining? Try to de-complexify the world.

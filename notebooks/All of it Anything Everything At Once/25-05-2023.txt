So, the forward by Jim Cathart, I want to introduce the book here, how to work a room,
a guy and two successfully managing the mingling. They say that by Jim Cathart,
C-P-A-E, author of relationships selling, how to get and keep customers.
They say that in this world, it's not what you know, but who you know.
No other book I have seen will do more for you than this one in the area of making connections
in developing professional contacts. Exceptional business leaders have one single talent
that sets them apart from all others. They're about to develop business friendships.
Business friendships can cement an empire or they can simply make a professional dinner
more enjoyable and profitable. Ideally, these friendships are low intention,
high incorporation based on mutual trust and they desire to both people to help and support each other.
To develop these kinds of friendships, you need to persuade people that you can make their business,
a little more successful. Their days are a little easier and in short, their lives are a little happier.
Suzanne Rohan is not only a master at building business friendships.
She's also a master at coaching others to build them.
I have watched Susan work a room and been amazed at the many ways she finds
to generate pleasant conversation, show an interest, excuse me, oh boy.
I have watched Susan work a room and been amazed at the many ways she finds to generate pleasant conversation,
show an interest in others and develop affinity and contracts with people,
even when their points of common interest are not immediately evident.
She has been speaking and conducting her seminar on contacts, connections and cocktails,
how to work a room for seven years and has worked with tens of thousands of people.
Her articles have been published in magazines, newspapers and professional journals.
This book will serve you well. It will show you how to overcome shyness or awkwardness
when meeting new people and how to change strangers into friends that haven't met yet.
It will also give you the tools and confidence to expand these initial contacts
into personal and professional friendships that can enrich your business and your life.
I congratulate you on selecting this book. I assure you that it will be pleasant reading
and make meeting new people a source of greater pleasure and satisfaction for you and for them.
Okay.

Introductions. You can tell, you can tell by the feel of the envelope that it's an invitation to something in your right.
One of your clients is the honorary chairperson for a local charity and they are throwing a huge fundraiser into weeks.
Not only should you go, but many potential clients will be there and it's a chance to meet people and promote your business.
Sounds like fun, but before you even have a chance to think about what you're wearing, a little voice in the back of your head pipes up.
Wait a minute, you're walking to that enormous ballroom and seeing thousands of strangers. They'll all know one another, but no one will know you.
Who will you talk to? What will you say?
Your teeth will start to grind and your gingerly place, you gingerly place the invitation and your wait to see file.
You are not alone. This scenario happens daily in offices and homes across the country.
It doesn't matter whether the invitation is for a purely social event, a business gathering, or a combination of the two.
It's uncomfortable to walk into a room full of people you don't know, especially when you want to make a good impression.
It's also one of the best business and social opportunities you'll ever run across.
The benefits of being able to work a room with ease and grace are enormous.
You'll feel better by yourself, okay, in one note here. You'll feel better by yourself.
You approach a business or social gatherings with enthusiasm and confidence, knowing that this is an arena where you feel comfortable and productive.
Yes, you make invaluable business contacts.
Most fucking ads, dude, sucks.

You'll feel better by yourself.
You'll approach business or social gatherings with enthusiasm and confidence, knowing that
this is an area where arena, where you feel comfortable and productive.
You make invaluable business contacts, as well as starting friendships that may last
your whole life.
If you hadn't been able to walk up to people, smile, put out your hand and say hi, those
opportunities might have been lost.
You make other people feel more comfortable, which makes them want to know and impossibly
do business with you.
I have written this book with one goal in mind.
To give you the confidence and the tools to walk into any room and shine, whether the event
is social or professional, a meeting, a meeting, party, reunion, PTA committee, or the inaugural
ball, this book is designed to help you manage these events successfully and mingle with ease
and come away feeling that you have accomplished your own goals and made other people feel good
in the process.
Everybody wins.
The focus will be on identifying the roadblocks that inhibit us from circulating with ease
and comfort and eliminating them and then eliminating them.
For each roadblock, there is an effective remedy, strengthening confidence and projecting
the warmth and sincerity that invites people to open up.

Practical tips and strategies for starting conversations.

In the 80s and 90s, if actually communicating what you and your business are all about
is not just a plus, but an essential.
Working a room can be your number one marketing strategy.
It's some of the best advertising you can get, and it's free.
All of us work rooms. If you've ever been to a wedding or a meeting, you've worked the room.
Or else, coming to a deep appreciation, appreciation of how much easier and more pleasant life would be if you developed this skill.
People in my presentations tell me that the most upsetting thing about these events is that everyone else seems to be completely comfortable.
It just isn't so. Most people don't like entering a room full of strangers for any reason.
A party with strangers is the number one social fear.
According to a study on social anxiety reported in the New York Times December 18th, 1984.
It was really pretty recent then, 19th.
Oh, we know.
Introduction, I'm so confused.
So is this her wedding or is it?

Interesting. Fear number two, that attend an event with people we don't know.
Very interesting. So I think I've overcome the first one, but sorry, the latter one.
In my program, 90% of the participants admit that they are not comfortable at events where they don't know a good number of people.
When I pull only those involved in sales and marketing, presumably one of the most outgoing groups anywhere.
This figure only drops to 80%.
Less than in my programs, of the participants, of the participants admit that they are not comfortable at events where they don't know a good number of people.

This figure only drops to 80%.
Less than 0.025%, say they actually enjoy walking into room full of strangers.
Research shows that 40% of all adults have social anxiety, according to a New York Times report on research by Dr. Bella DiPolo, a psychologist at the University of Virginia.
People often can't judge how they impress others.
People often can't judge how they impress others.
June 30, 1997, at a party with strangers, 75% of adult experience anxiety.
What the fuck?
Do that's crazy.
So if you're uncomfortable with a client's invitation to the charity fundraiser, or your first meeting of a professional association, or when a colleague invites you to the professional, invite you to the rotary, or when your spouse adjusts you come along to the trade show, or when you get the notice of your 20th high school union, even alone.
In fact, you're in a very good company.
It might even be said that if you didn't have some anxiety, if you didn't have some anxiety, you would not be normal.
Most of us want to feel comfortable with other people, even strangers, and we'll do whatever it takes to minimize the anxiety and move through a crowded room with ease and grace.
We want to be comfortable and to make other people feel comfortable.
We want to manage the mingling so that we have fun, so that we have fun, feel good about ourselves, score some professional points, and feel that even putting in an appearance is a good use of our time.
This book is for anyone who has to attend events, parties, meetings, conventions, trade shows, fundraisers, cocktail hours, business meetings, professional dinners, reunions, political gatherings, social events, social evenings, etc.
The emphasis would be on business, but the principles hold true for any event and for any age group.
This book is for anyone who wants to feel more comfortable in a room.
Working a room is an old political phrase that conjures up images of overweight men in smoky back rooms, pressing flesh and cutting deals.
That's not what we mean today.
When I talk about working a room, I mean the ability to circulate comfortably and graciously through a gathering of meat people, meeting, greeting, and talking with as many of them as you wish.
Creating communication that is warm and sincere, establishing an honest rapport upon which you can build a friendship, and knowing how to start, how to continue and end a lively and interesting conversation.
There is nothing calculated nor manipulative about working a room.
If you don't really care about people, if you're warmth, your openness, and your desire to connect with them are not genuine, then no technique in the world will help.
People sense the truth. They usually know when they are being manipulated.
They also know when you are making a sincere effort to extend yourself to them, and they appreciate it.
My guideline is, go to have fun and enjoy the people. The professional benefits will follow, but go.
Interesting.
Working a room is a risk. No doubt about it. Our egos are on the line, and that can be intimidating.
It can be tremendous rewarding on both the personal and professional level.
This book is about understanding what keeps us from approaching these events with ease and enthusiasm, and about what we can do to make them comfortable, pleasant, profitable, and even fun.
It's about giving ourselves permission to work every room we enter, and to reap the benefits, both personal and professional.
Practice really does make perfect, and I encourage you to read and to attend as many events as you can, and practice the techniques in this book.
Some will work well, and others may not be right for you.
But as Mom always said, it couldn't hurt to try. No one ever died from eating spinach, or from going to a charity fundraiser.
You may find that you already know some of the information in this book, or that you have already practiced some of the techniques.
Good. Let the book serve as a reminder in sharpen your skills as you go along. The more you practice, the better you'll be, and above all, enjoy.
Get ready.
Chapter 1. The Roblox.
Mother's Dyer Warnings.


====== REC006.txt ======
If working a room is so much fun and so profitable,
why do our hearts thump, our palms sweat, and our eyes glaze over when we think about it?
The answer is that many years ago, we learned certain survival techniques at our mother's knees.
Mom gave us these desires, gave us these dire warnings.
These lack of desires, I guess.
It's normalized though.
One more time.
The answer is that many years ago, we learned how the answer is that many years ago,
we learned certain survival techniques at our mother's knees.
Mom gave us these dire warnings with best of intentions.
Mom gave us these dire warnings with the best of intentions.
For our own good, and everybody agreed that we should heed them.
The trouble is that they worked a lot better when we were six years old than they do now when we are 20, 40, 60, or 80.
And we forget to turn them off.
Now that we are no longer walking home alone from the first grade,
these dire warnings have changed from safety barriers into roadblocks that prevent us from mingling comfortably and effectively with other people.
Mom isn't a blame.
She was just doing her job to protect us, and we love her for it.
But we heard these warnings so often, and perhaps repeated them to our own kids so often,
that they began to sound like the truth.
There are five major roadblocks to work in a room successfully.
Knowing where they come from is the first step to letting them go.
Roadblock 1. Don't talk to strangers.
This first roadblock is as American as Apple fucking pie.
This first roadblock is American as Apple pie.
It is often accompanied by shaking of the index finger.
It made sense when our mothers gave it to us, and it made sense when we gave it to our children.
We still don't want our children to talk to strangers on the way home from school.
Today more than ever, but it doesn't make sense when we're selling a product at a trade show,
beginning our first day on a new job, attending a formal ball or mingling at a professional association meeting
where contacts and connections are standing six deep around the room.
Yet we often find ourselves standing in the door, paralyzed with that imaginary finger,
shaking in our faces at the message, and the message, don't talk to strangers,
flashing across our subconscious.
So we don't. It's so we don't.

So we don't. Instead, we choose a nice quiet spot at the horse door table and start nibbling.
Get very busy with a cup of coffee or a drink, smile nervously around the room, and no one in particular,
and have an awful time.

We also miss tremendous business, career and social opportunities.
Who knows what wonderful, that what what what who knows, who knows what wonderful person or valuable contact was standing around that room,
feeling just as uncomfortable as we were.
Life is too short and time too precious to spend an hour or two squandering opportunities and having a bad time in the process.
Roadblock 2


====== REC007.txt ======
I lost some stuff.
People who wait for others to come to them
can often be found in the corner of the room,
holding up the walls and being those who glide around the reception
or the cocktail party, meaning party, meaning people.
Stop holding up the walls, man. Get to the party.
That's great. That's fantastic.
Stop holding up the walls. Don't be such a...
Don't tell them they're alone. Don't tell them they're stopping themselves.
Stop holding up the walls. That's what they're doing.
You're doing nothing.
Come and join us. Stop holding up the walls.
That's great, dude.
People who wait for others to come to them can often be found in the corner of the room,
holding up the walls.
And being those who glide around the reception or the cocktail party, meaning people.
And let's talk about pushy.
There is pushy and there is pushy.
Obviously you don't want to throw yourself into a stranger's arms
or pin him down on the conference table,
wagging your finger in his face and forcing fistful of business cards
into his pockets, into his pockets.
That's one thing.
It's quite another to approach someone in a pleasant friendly way
to smile, to smile, introduce yourself,
and say something like,
this is my first meeting.
Is there always such a good turnout?
This is my first meeting.
Is there always such a good turnout?
To the mundane first.
To the commonly valued, easy to...
baseline, baseline interaction.
You have to do small talk to get deeper talk.
People who fall victim, if you can direct it.
People who fall victim to the prom king, queen complex,
sit around waiting for the world to find them,
have often passively accepted their label shy.
Accepted the label shy.
They may or may not be shy,
but that is how people think of them.
And that is how they've come to think of themselves.
People who fall victim to the prom king, queen complex,
and sit around waiting for the world to find them,
have often passively accepted the label as shy.
They may or may not actually be shy,
but that is how people think of them,
and that is how they've come to think of themselves.
In one of my early jobs as an elementary teacher,
I found that though these labels often become self-fulfilling,
prophecies, I have self-fulfilling prophecies.
The troublemaker of the class has always found a way
to maintain that dubious distinction.
The talker, today's conversationalist,
always managed to get the most red checks
next to keeps profitably busy.
I'm afraid I fell into this category,
but to this day I can't imagine anything more compelling
about school than social intercourse with my classmates.
Multiplication tables, diagramming sentences,
give me no passing and furtive whispering in the back row.

In the magic of thinking,
in the magic of thinking big,
Dr. David Schwartz says,
it's a mark of real leadership to take the lead in getting to know people.
It's always a big person who walks up to you
and offers his or her hand and says hello.


====== REC008.txt ======
A roadblock form, a better safe and sorry, so you work up your nerve to approach a stranger.
You smile, say hello, and introduce yourself, and introduce yourself.
The other person casts you a disinterested glance that screams, who cares?
This hurts, no one wants to be rebuffed or ignored.
Our egos are on the line when we extend ourselves to others, because there's always the
possibility that they won't be interested in talking with us.
But mother's dire warning, that we're better safe and sorry, puts a real damper on the
risk, puts a real damper on risk, and risk is the name of the game when you are working
a room.
I like to think of this risk as a challenge.
If you don't have anything on the table, you never win.
If you don't take the risk and reach out to people, you never make new friends or contacts.
You never make new friends or contacts.
We risk our lives all the time on the freeway.

Roadblock 5. He or she only wants one thing. The intercepted pass. Mother may have had a point here.
Mother may have had a point here, but she was probably talking about high school boys in the 1950s.
libidos are inclined to cool, at least somewhat, in the passage from the locker room to the boardroom.
Still, we run the risk, run the risk that our warm, open, friendly manner will be misconstrued as an invitation to liason.
He or she only wants one thing, in fact we would say. Mother may have had a point here, but she was probably talking about high school boys in the 1950s.
libidos are inclined to cool, at least somewhat, in the passage from the locker room to the boardroom.
Still, we run the risk that our warm, open, friendly manner will be misconstrued as an invitation to liason.
Women are especially vulnerable to this misinterpretation. A touch on the arm that is intended as a simple gesture of understanding can be misconstrued as an indication of sexual interest.
Nevertheless, Mother's warning is a bit extreme. We can't walk around with a notion that every member of the opposite sex is ready to pounce on us at the slightest provocation.
That would put us back into high school in the 50s, and for me, at least once was enough.
I'm so sorry.
The expectations and relationships are broken, I couldn't say otherwise to them.
You can't say, you can't, or normally you just ask out, and they have an interest in you, then you can have something to go forward on in a abrupt way.
But it impede, not having that part, not having the expectation to met.
It's in the back burner of my mind to have that relation.
So you look for it, you expect it, you would like it, you would appreciate it.
See, it would seem to come from that, it would seem to come from easily to other friends.
No one would ask a man, no one would ask a man in that way.
I would love to be asked if someone would find an interest, but they would not.
So all you made to is that feared thing of acting exactly in that way.
We act to fucking ask.
He or she only wants one thing, it's not the one thing.
It's still a seeking, which way it sucks.
You shouldn't be seeking it, you shouldn't expect it, you should just...
But why be lonely when you could just ask?
Oh my god, this doesn't make sense.


====== REC010.txt ======
Risking the roadblocks. These fine roadblocks are part of what stops us from
mingling, circulating, and working a room. In the next chapter we'll discuss
specific remedies for each roadblock, but there is something else that can
stop us from moving comfortably around a room. Something more subtle than
the five particular roadblocks we've just discussed. It has to do with
self-perception, self-confidence, and self-esteem. People who register low
on low in these areas can talk themselves out of meeting people and
feeling at ease talking to them. In talking to yourself, Dr. Pamela Butler
deals with the concept of self-talk, really, really! Not literally though, these
internalized, interimaginable things, I think. Self-talk is in your head, I believe.
That's my intuition to it. I don't think she talked about siliquity, that's too
crazed. In talking to yourself, Dr. Pamela Butler deals with the concept of
self-talk. These are the things we say to ourselves in our minds. She didn't
see it. You can say it to yourself, too, literally. You don't say in your mind, you
say in your mind, it cycles and cycles and cycles and cycles and cycles. If you
say it aloud, then suddenly it stops cycling and it's like, oh yeah, I have it
epiphany, that's the thing I want to do. So literally talk to yourself, just talk
to yourself. These are the things we say to ourselves in our minds, sometimes
even without being aware that we are saying them. Self-talk can either be positive
or negative. Dr. Butler says that we can change negative self-talk to positive
self-talk, and this transformation can have benefits in all areas of our lives.
Here is some of the negative self-talk that might come up when you think of
working in a room. I've always had trouble meeting people. It's just the way I
am. I don't have anything important or interesting to say. I'll just
embarrass myself. Better to keep quiet and be cool. Why would anyone want to
listen to me? All these people have more important things to do. Take a moment
to write down any negative self-talk you might have, and then rewrite those
statements in the positive ones. The above comments might be rewritten as, I'm
not having fun practicing meeting people and getting better at it all the
time. I'm enjoying mastering a new skill. I want to extend myself to other
people and know that the most vulnerable thing I have to offer is myself. If I'm
open-noticed, I'll feel good about myself and so will they. We're all busy, but
everyone enjoys connecting with other people. I'm a valuable like a person.
Extending myself is a gift that others appreciate. We're all busy. Okay,
like these last things. Take a moment to write down. Okay, try saying this to
better yourself. I'm having fun practicing meeting new people and getting
better at it all the time. I'm having fun practicing meeting new people and
getting better at it all the time. I'm enjoying mastering a new skill. I want to
extend myself to other people and I know that the most valuable thing I have to
offer is myself. If I'm open-noticed, I'll feel good about myself and so will
they. We're all busy, but everyone enjoys connecting with other people. I'm
a valuable like a person. Extending myself is a gift that others that others
appreciate.

Change is a risk.
Change of any kind is a risk and feels uncartible.
Even when the change is for the good, it's a little sad to leave the old house, even when
we're moving into a much nicer one.
Even when we're moving into a much nicer one.
We leave behind the old, familiar, ways and step into new ground.
A step onto new ground.
A step onto new ground.
No matter how unwonderful the change, getting married, expanding your business, moving
to an exciting new city, switching careers, there is always a certain amount of discomfort.
For most of us, working a room is a change.
But extending ourselves to people is almost always worth it, worth the risk.
When we try to succeed, it feels like a million dollars.
But when we allow a negative self-talk to prevail, we can talk ourselves out of taking
a risk and become overwhelmed by the roblox.
How many times have you seen someone who looked vaguely familiar, but were afraid to go over
because he might not be who you thought he was?
I say, so what if I am wrong?
And so what if I am wrong?
The worst thing that can happen is that he says he is not that person, and I have made
new acquaintance, possibly a new friend.
In 1981, I attended my first meeting of local professional association.
One of the men there looked like a person I met in the previous June at a career training
conference.
He was standing alone at the bar.
Several questions raced through my mind when I saw him.
What if he wasn't that man I met, but just to look alike?
What do you think I was coming on to him?
On the other hand, what if he really was the person I met and felt slighted that I didn't
recognize him?
Should I go up and say hello, should I go up and say hello, or wait for him to come to
me?
Of all these possibilities, I decided that the worst result would be he was the person I
met and thought I was ignoring him.
My value system, my value system, which includes more than a mild dose of guilt, took over.
I approached Ferrell Chiles, Ferrell Chiles and mentioned the June conference.
He was not the person I met, but we had a pleasant conversation.
We had been following the careers series and in the San Francisco examiner, and remembered
several of my columns, wow, that made me feel terrific.
I was very glad that it overcome my reluctance to approach him.
The benefits have been immeasurable, the benefits have been immeasurable, we play significant
roles in each other's networks, and we are friends, damn.
We tell the story of a unique mirror's first meeting and always pay tribute to that great
old line.
Don't I know you from someplace?
That's incredible, dude.
Many of my colleagues, there's got to be a word for that, though.
Many of my colleagues attend business social sponsored by local chambers or commerce.
These are tatted as an opportunity to meet other single people in a setting with some
prop priority.
At one mixer, a friend of a woman who intrigued himself, who intrigued him, he watched her
talking, laughing, and enjoying herself.
I really wanted to meet her, he said.
I really wanted to meet her, he said.
She appeared to be so warm and positive, and she had a great laugh.
All that came to mind were those self-critical comments that convinced me that she wouldn't
like me.
I never even introduced myself.
What a loss.
Another associate had a happier experience.
At a holiday party, she decided to go for it, and asked one of the men she'd met to dance.
Debra, named change to protect the innocent, had hoped for a more romantic outcome.
Then an exchange of business cards, but that was not the case.
She told me that she was disappointed, but also congratulated herself for having the courage
to risk rejection.
She practiced a new behavior, and she survived.
Debra, who thinks of herself as shy, knows that next time it would be easier, corralling
your courage, no one can give you the courage to introduce yourself to a stranger.
But some people are more supportive of that behavior than others.
My advice, stick with those who encourage you to take the initiative, my advice, wow.
No one can give you the courage to introduce yourself to a stranger, but some people are
more supportive of that behavior than others.
My advice, stick with those who encourage you to take the initiative.
Sean, you didn't fear at all, and talking to that audience, you just got up and said
the thing you wanted to do, that is legendary in my mind, legendary, corralling your courage.
You had no courage to bear, it was just like nature.
One way to muster up the courage to take a risk, you didn't see as a risk.
One way to muster up the courage, it was nonchalant.
One way to muster up the courage to take the courage to take a risk is to ask yourself,
what's the worst that can happen?
Surprisingly enough, your worst fear is usually not a matter of life and death, and the odds
are that that disaster will not occur, and then even if it does, you will survive.
Taking the risk is almost always worth it as comfort, it's a cliche, but nothing ventured
nothing gained.
At least some Miller, a travel, a travel pan planner in the Marin, Marin County, north
of San Francisco, said to me at an event, I realized that the worst possible thing would
be that someone wouldn't like me or would laugh at me.
And so what?
Of all the other people here, someone will like me, understanding that gave me confidence
to keep trying, and now it is more fun than it is work.
Reminders, mothers dire warnings, reminders, mothers dire warnings, still work in our sub-conscious.
These five roadblocks can prevent us from making the most of a party or a business event.
It is...
Okay, you gotta subdued these reminders.
Don't talk to strangers, wait to be properly introduced.
Good things come to those who wait, better safe than sorry.
He or she only wants one thing.
Be intercepted pass.
Be aware of negative self-talk, and change it into positive self-talk.
Extending yourself to people feels risky, but the benefits are well worth the discomfort.
Chapter 2.
The Remedies.
Removing the roadblocks.
Now for the good news.
For every roadblock, there is a remedy.
Members dire warnings can stop us at any time, unless we apply the appropriate remedy,
unless we apply the appropriate remedy.
Remedy 1.
Redefine the term stranger.
Mom says not to talk to strangers.
Okay, let's redefine the term.
Obviously, we have to exercise some caution in today's society.
Not every street corner in town is a suitable place to mix and mingle, and there will always
be some people who, for some inexplicable reason, make you feel very uneasy.
Go with your gut reaction.
To be as gut, well, as you're saying, dude, there was legitimate reason for you to fear.
You had to fall, you got reaction, you got reaction saved, you and your brother.
Those people looked like they could have been dangerous.
In your description, they were saying, that was terrifying, man, one of your traumatized
women.
Ten years old, and you're running with adults.
They have knives.
Ain't knife.
You see a glint.
You knew that's it.
Your brain is like on fire to escape.
Tell your brother to run and you take different directions.
But if you are attending a meeting or a professional colleagues, you're not really with strangers.
If you go to a PTA meeting, you may not know anyone in the room, but you all have a common
interest in quality education for your children.
When you go to a new health club, a new church, a new synagogue, a new charitable political
organization, you have a common interest with those people.
You know, interesting, very interesting.
When you go to a party, you probably know the host or hostess.
At a wedding, you have some connection with the bride or groom.
At a baseball game, notice how everyone talks to everyone else who is rooting for the same
team.
Look for what you have in common with people at an event.
This is the planning that helps you feel more comfortable and more prepared.
You share interest with anyone who does the same kind of work with you.
Like you do, who is interested in your work or whose work interests you.
You share interest with anyone who does the same kind of work you do.
Who is interested in your work or who is interested in your work?
People who sell respirators, perform surgery, repair medical equipment, and process insurance
have common calligraphy, calligraphy, calligraphy, calligraphy, calligraphy band.
They all deal with hospitals.
If you volunteer for the local United Way, local United Way, March of Dimes or Public
Radio Station, you have a common interest both with other volunteers and with people
who volunteer for the organizations.
People who have children have a common bond.
Whether they are construction engineers, musicians, used car salesmen, or company presidents.
These common interests can be the basis for conversation, understanding what we have
in common with them, with others, takes the edge off our reluctance to approach them
as strangers.
A friend of mine attended a formal fundraiser for his son's school, and in talking with
another father, whom he knew from Little League, discovered that the other dad did
exactly the executive search.
And happy coincidence, since my friend was planning a career change.
Yeah, this stuff is mundane as shit.
It's almost 2 o'clock.
Now, these common interests, these common interests can be the basis for conversation.
Understanding what we have in common with others takes the edge off our reluctance to approach
them as strangers.
A friend of mine attending a formal fundraiser for his son's school, for his son's school,
and in talking with another father, whom he knew from Little League, discovered.
Use common sense when approaching people you don't know, but loosen up with a definition
of stranger, so that mother's dire warning doesn't keep you from establishing contacts
and communication.
Whether you're at a charity or awards banquet, or a spouse's company dinner dance, or your
child's soccer team playoffs, identifying the common ground can help you break the ice.
You will feel more comfortable, and that will be your reward for changing behavior and
breaking through a roadblock.
For many two, practice a self-introduction.
Scarlett O'Hara may have needed a proper introduction, but we live in a different world.
We may never meet another living soul, okay, I'm tired of this, I was good, but I'll
get back to it.
It's good, it's good, it's all good, it's very good.

So we got to start the enact, the enact, the enact dialogue system written in reference
to projects, autumn, autumn, natures, fortune, and doda could be under our home.
Last update?
The beginning is to the description.
Yeah, boy.
I don't even read that shit.
Yeah, the dialogue system has been in my life for all of seven years, and it is in this document
that I would finally compound.
I would finally compound on all my insights and all my supposed insights and instill you
with a model for how it's meant to operate the games.
And an act is an abstraction.
It's an abstraction of a real world, relational abilities, and each of these twelve plus two
symbols conveys a broad type of emotion, expression, and response values in variables in our behavior
too.
What do you call it?
The system's weighted responses.
We didn't weighted expressions.
The expressions were internal and external and it's okay.
The symbols are extracted to it in a way.
It's relevant to how false and not damn it.
Myersberg's bullshit.
Myersberg's bullshit and astrology is bullshit.
And this thing, if used wrongly, I've seen wrongly, would also be bullshit.
Because emotions go in so much more variation than these simple expressions.
So, the thing of want and take.
The thing of return.
Okay, the one thing of want and take.
Seeking to have something.
So, there's distinction there.
And there's return and give.
Return and give.
Seeking to have something back.
Or have something in this.
And that's the thing that had it.
Return.
Return.
Wanting.
Believing good.
What do you say in that?
Return and give.
The thing of reactivating itself.
The activates.
The activates.
Seeking to have something back.
I shouldn't give a description of that.
It's too complex to put it.
I mean, that one is.
Dumbass.
Okay, want and take.
Return and give.
Anxiety fear.
Okay, the feeling of unease.
Unease or worry.
The anxiety or fear.
It's too simple.
Too simple.
Elation sorrow.
Elation.
I'm sorry.
Elation.
So, I'm too.
The feeling of pleasure or happiness.
Misery.
A reaped of.
The feeling of pain or sadness.
Empathy.
The ability to see a...
I see likeness.
And then to regard.
Or love others.
Enemity.
Enemity.
The ability to see likeness.
And then to blame for hate others.
Blame hate or disparage or distance.
Or enmity is the thing of this relation.
The thing of gain pride.
The feeling of having something.
The feeling of having something.
Or being given to.
Or for.
Or for.
Gain or pride.
The feeling of having something.
Or not.
No.
The feeling of gaining something.
Of being turned to.
Of being.
Having satisfaction.
The thing of being given to.
Or seeing that the thing of wanting.
Or taking is.
Is fulfilled.
So this goes more complexity.
I can't put a miss that in here.
So there's expressions, but there's more to it than anyone.
The inactive response.
And the inactive having.
Or principle.
So there's the thing of wanting.
There's also the thing of having.
And that thing is very interesting.
I'll get to it.
But.
So the thing of gain pride.
The feeling of loss.
Shame.
Guilt.
The feeling of being stolen from.
Lost from oneself.
Or a more.
Response.
A build-up of not using.
The thing of wanting or take.
Or return.
Give actions.
So response.
Often.
It might go in way of.
In the extreme.
It might go in the way of progression.
But it goes.
It goes in way of automated response.
But.
Sorry, that's bullshit.
If you want to interrupt someone.
If you're feeling like.
Okay.
Or.
Surprise.
Or.
There was more to it than anyone.
Let me show you the thing.
Because it's more and less important.
So loss.
Lost shame, guilt.
Response.
Balance.
And then depression.
So balance and depression.
But other plus two symbols.
Because those are not exactly chosen.
And another number chosen.
If you are determined to creatures.
Please know that.
The thing of balance and depression.
Those are just in acts that we have no explicit.
Say on.
Or.
Sorry.
None of it's set on.
None of it's set on.
But depression.
We just fall to it.
And balance.
We are in it.
If we are.
That's right.
That's right.
I'm trying to convey that.
I couldn't really.
That works in the text, I think.
It needs better iteration.
But let me go into this.
So this thing isn't fucking important.
So there's two.
Two of them is important.
Two of them are important.
The inactive response.
It represents how one's values and beliefs are projected onto others.
And how reciprocal and subtractive behaviors can have positive or negative outcomes.
In the context of the game, the ability to yield a response is crucial.
As it allows for quick feedback and conversations.
Inability to yield a response can lead to anxiety and fear.
Exactly.
Or fear or through to fear.
As the individual may make feel trapped in circumstances.
Characters using the inactive X will often automatically respond.
If the player does not choose a dialogue option.
Allowing for comedy, they would have autonomy.
Allowing for conversations to continue.
Staying in it.
And characters would only be able to give feedback.
They can respond whenever they will.
That's a bad text.
We may have to, I say, fake out questions if we can't.
If we can't get the mask asked so autonomously.
But I think we can totally get the mask questions.
If the world is given grounding.
If there's a evaluation to their knowledge, even.
Interesting.
Interesting.
A response can be an internal.
Part of the text.
A response can be internal.
But externalizing it can lead to various behaviors such as, I say, reaction.
Relief.
Aggression.
It's not a reaction, though.
Because reaction is the thing.
No, it isn't.
And reaction is response.
Reaction and responsive.
Same thing.
Relief.
Aggression.
These many ways we would realize.
And then vote on a return.
Return.
Bad things.
Bad returns.
Give returns.
This is the amount we would express.
It's like an automation.
If it's extreme to the point we can.
We couldn't withhold.
We couldn't just feel.
We got to say.
Inactive response.
This is what characters do a lot.
This is what the player is doing.
We can evaluate the game by all.
It's very interesting.
It's very interesting.
So there's the player character and then there's the player.
There's the player acting on a player character.
And then there's the player character itself.
So characters might have idle animations.
They might have expressive features that would give them some commands of personality and how they interact with the world.
And then there's the player character.
And then there's the player character.
And then there's the player character.
And then there's the player character.
And then there's the player character.
And then there's the player character.
And then there's the player character.
And then there's the player character.
And then there's the player character.
And then there's the player character.

Inability to yield a response can lead to anxiety and fear, as the individual may feel trapped
in their circumstances.
Characters using these enacts will automatically respond to the players and not choose the
dialogue options, allowing for conversation to continue.
Statements.
Okay, that text.
Characters only wait for a competitor.
Okay, response can be internal.
Response can be internal, but externalizing it can lead to various behaviors such as reaction,
relief, aggression.
Let's say, relevation to various revolutions as delivered by your expression of saying,
is your idea and not ideating on it as the process goes out.
Sores, boy.
Repetition can take the form of retorts, repetition, recognition, revocation, anger, aggression,
and surprise.
All these other variations on the thing of almost reactionary response are in that reaction,
in these reactionary responses.
Then to relief, relief in revocation, relief in understanding, relief in just giving thought to something,
or in the quietitude of thought.
Quietitude for reflection.
I'm lost in the text.
Okay, then to...

Okay, this is good text, I'm going to read it, I'm very tired.
The inactive having, principle.
To have a thing, we would have, we would have value.
This gives us good sensations.
SAS find one that we would apply to the object that we would have.
We would have.
To test a strength, we are connections to things.
We say that for ourselves.
How much loss would you feel if they, if you test something,
you will take it from you?
If this reaction is possession in our behavior to objects,
or people in circumstances possession to a partner,
possession to, well,
it's tied up in the wrong things.
It is the actual thing of the legalese,
the contract, the shared trust.
Great.
Hello, I'm so tired of you.
But having one self here,
you have yourself, another has their own,
but you would not have each other in a way that is on that.
You would not own another, and they would not own you.
The idea of separation,
I would not all do theory of mind,
but the separation thing, well, correct, I'm so tired, dude.
How does one keep to their own ideals?
Okay, if this reaction is possession in our behavior to objects,
how does one keep to their own ideals?
In the abstractness,
what we have in comparison to people,
also there was an independent evaluation,
in the evaluation sense,
of a lot of other aspects that have to be there.
How does the next step on all things,
how do you feel that you already,
from what you just said,
what others would expect of it,
and what others would expect of it,
what others would expect of it,
or what others would expect of it.

So the inactive elation pleasure, elation in pleasure is a complex emotion that can be,
okay, this is chat to you, but it's a complex emotion that can be associated with feelings
of happiness, excitement, and love.
It is often triggered by positive experiences such as receiving recognition or surprises,
and the desire for love for mothers.
Elation is expressed through smiles, laughter, warmth, joy, and even song.
Good expression, and can result in a feeling of fulfillment in satisfaction.
While elation can be a positive experience, it can also be linked to negative behaviors
such as greed and selfishness.
This is because it's received a great response.
This is because it eludes the pursuit of elation made with individuals to harm others
who are engaged, harmed with activity, in the monoscript and religious.
Elation is associated with the release of dopamine.
A neurotransmitter, say you have release of dopamine when you have over someone.
You've gained above them in this thing.
I have more money than you.
I have a bigger house.
I have a better car.
The thing of expression in the way of consumption than what we have.
I have better clothes.
I have more decorating than you.
You would look on those in power restorers, ones that are under...
There's bias in our way of expression to our bodies.
And that just goes to those follows.
So elation is associated with the release of dopamine.
A neurotransmitter that can be resolved in feelings of addiction and intense desire for more.
In the extreme cases, this can lead to a sense of constant anticipation and never ending
and a never ending pursuit of the thing.
They would aspire to and we would enjoy happiness, say.
But it's not just what happiness there is.
There's misaligned traits to the thing of dopamine connection.
So it can't just be joint happiness, it's silly.
The thing of elation and pleasure is complicated.
It's important to note that while elation can bring happiness,
too much of it can result in disconnection from reality
and a lack of empathy for others.
And maybe a lack of empathy for others.
Additionally, elation and additionally, elation can be feeding in temporary
and relying so on it for happiness can lead to disappointment and a sense of emptiness.
It's important to seek balance of elation against other positive emotions.
It's seeing value in gratitude to lead a fulfilling and well-rounded life.
Contending with other people leads us well.
That's my say, but to be contented, to live a well-rounded and well-rounded life
in aspiration of the thing of elation, pleasure, to good works, good efforts.
If you do a task well, if you do a thing well, you do art well.
You might have pleasure to the release of funnization or a immediate fulfillment
or a resulting fulfillment in the process.


====== REC019.txt ======
In extreme cases, this can lead to a state of constancy.
Okay, yeah.
It's important to know that while I'm fit, it's okay.
All right.
Be okay.

The enact of pain or agony, pain agony, pain can take many forms, including physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual.
Physical pain is often the result of injury or illness, and can limit a person's body to function.
Emotional pain can stem from grief, loss, or betrayal, and can cause feelings of sadness, anger, guilt or despair.
Psychological pain can be caused by trauma or abuse, and can have lasting effects on mental health.
Spiritual pain can cause a sense of disconnection or loss of grief.
Belief lost in a person can't be a lost faith.
I think that loss of faith, it says so extremely, but if you lose faith in self, that is a sensation of pain and agony, to have lost, to lose in a way of relation.
So as you interact with others in this world, in this game, it is important to approach pain with empathy and compassion, avoid causing pain to others, and recognize when you have done so.
Take responsibility for your actions and make sure that you are meant to cause harm.
Remember to be a tune and test your needs about it.
Listen actively, and with that judgment, it's offer support and care when needed.
By upholding values of compassion and nonviolence, we can create a more harmonious and peaceful world.
Pain is not a thing we should, we should, we should, we should, pain is not a thing we so should ever need for.
Pain is not a thing we should ever need for.
Unless in the way of pleasure, which is interesting, because you can tie it back to that if it is...
A person is a king, right?
You can't just don't despair to say, don't give pain without consent to say, which is really literal.
I'm embarrassed to say that, but that's how it is in nature.
In the way of nature, we have a lot of behavior towards our beings. It's actual creatures.
Remember to be a tune to the needs of others.
Listen actively without judgment.
It's important for people to learn how to recognize when they have caused pain in others,
and so they can take steps to make things right.
How to recognize when you have caused pain.
Step one.
The person may express their pain to you directly.
Sometimes the person you heard will tell you directly that they are in pain.
They may say things like, they hurt, they've had that hurt my feelings.
Or you hurt me more than...
You hurt me when you did that.
Two.
Changes in behavior.
If you notice that someone is acting, someone is acting differently around you or seems upset.
It could be a sign that you've caused that pain.
Physical reactions.
People can experience physical reactions to emotional pain, such as crying, shaking, or withdrawing.
If you notice any of these signs, it's possible that you've caused pain.
Remember empathy.
Sometimes you may feel pain.
You feel pain yourself when you realize you've caused someone else's pain.
This is a sign of empathy to help you recognize when you've caused harm.
Once you recognize your cause, then you've caused pain.
It's important to take steps to make things right.
This might involve apologizing, making amends, and committing to doing better in the future.
It's also important to listen to the person you've heard, and to try to understand their perspective.
By taking responsibility for your actions, by your actions, and working to make things right,
you can help prevent further pain and promote healing in your relationships.

hopelessness, and despair. It can cause a person to withdraw from others and to
focus on their own pain and suffering. This can further exacerbate feeling
isolation and numbness and may may be leading to cycles of misery and despair.

Some common indicators include feelings of sadness or emptiness.
Loss of interest and activities that were in most once enjoyed once enjoyable.

Imagining one's despair is a sign of sympathy even if even so you do not know it.
Remember misery is a natural part of the human experience but it is not something that has to be endured alone.
When the right affordance of your support and care.
With the right affordance of your support and care all individuals can find a path towards healing.
Growth, then growth, then to emotional well-being.
We need not remain in misery.

The Inactive Empathy.
Empathy is a crucial aspect of building and maintaining relationships with the community,
within a community.
It allows you to connect with one another on a deeper, lower level and faster sense of
understanding and compassion.
Recognizing technology and other emotions really do a greater trust, a greater trust
of cooperation and other than conflicts or misunderstandings.
It is important to practice and I think that this is so important.
It is important to practice empathy regularly as it can improve emotional intelligence
and clean their work.
It seems more positive in your actions with others.
In this, building and maintaining strong relationships within your community requires
a fair commitment to empathy and understanding, even in the fact that face of significant
differences or challenges.
And working towards good understanding and compassion.
Individuals can help to create a more harmonious and supportive community for everyone.
If you notice that someone is struggling with a difficult situation or emotion, you
can show empathy by actively listening to them, expressing support and understanding
and refraining from judgment or creativity.
They can help them feel hurt and validate and can strengthen your relationship with them.

The enacted enmity, enmity, dammit.
The feelings of enmity can arise in situations where there are significant differences in
values, beliefs, or experiences.
When individuals allow their differences to lead to strong negative emotions, it can create
tension and conflict within a community.
It is between people, in general, like anyone can have the thing of enmity in lesser
extremes.
It is important to recognize and address these feelings in a constructive manner rather
than letting them fester and grow.
To overcome enmity, individuals can try to find common ground and work towards understanding
and compromise.
This can involve active listening, being open-minded, and recognizing that others may
have valid perspectives and experiences that differ from your own.
It may also involve seeking out meditation or other forms of conflict resolution to help
research, reach a resolution that benefits everyone involved.
It is a good advice.
You can not be negative.
Why express on hate?
The enacted game prize.

There's the enact of gain pride, gain pride, the idea of the concept of gain, which can be seen as well.
Adoration for and recognition of something that has happened to better the self, or seen to better the self.
Seen to, seen and seen others. You might have gain pride for someone else.
In the way that gain pride is to help internalize, there's also the externalized way of it, but there's also the flaunting of it too.
It's also the same in the extreme, but it's expressionary differently, because there's verbal expression of gain of pride, and then there's the behavioural expression of gain pride.
Someone acts, someone has an affect that behaviour that suggests the thing about it, and it can be wrongly attained, not wrongly attained, but it can be wrongly held, badly held, held in the way that this is associated to how pride is seen.
Between larger society, one can have false pride in the self. Self that is not useful to other people is pride that's only useful to their own.
Pride and admiration for the self can drive one to pursue goals, even if they go against the values of others, which is terrible, but they would do that.
Pride and pride keeps the mad advent of the other mad scientists. They keep the pride in their work, and it would drive them to these things of creation.
In the act of writing and writing, doing your manuscripts or writing anything, anything we have our expression that brings you good pride is fine.
It's just the thing of pride is differentiated depending on larger society and your own ideals values.
However, this pride can also bring about lies. As one may act in a way that's not reconciled with the thing of shared pride, shared valuation to pride, I could maybe say, leading to a disconnection from their own values.
Okay, gain gain in the way of greed can also be negative. Be a negative thing when it is achieved through manipulation of the thing of, say you probably puff someone up.
You puff someone up to have them give more to you. That's the way of manipulation in way of greed.
So gain, that's the question. So gain in the way of greed can also be a negative thing when it is achieved through manipulation or exploitation.
There it is, yeah. Yeah, gain in the way of greed can also be negative in, negative thing when it is achieved through manipulation, exploitation of others.
In such cases, gain can lead to a feeling of emptiness and guilt as well as damage to relationships and reputations.
So gain in the act of loss, shame, to assuage this effect, affect on a behavior we might want to act in the will of good return to that which we were stolen from or pay our recompense in an apology for being lost of oneself to remove one's guilt.
If the systems of operational hierarchy persist in our minds, we order ourselves in reversal the forward to put ourselves out, say we are not wanted in a way, then put forward the thought or action through this.
This may be inhibited. The forwarding to ask of another is how we ground ourselves to the other people.
Then if we endure to send ourselves apart too far apart, it goes to confusion, malice, distrust and all the other things that come with not understanding the other that would endure against the will of our minds.
So the schema, we hold other people, the schema, you would not hold one's exacting theory of mind. No one would know your true soul to things.
Do people have fear? That's bad writing. We fear against our own knowledge in opposition to the built in systems of wanting.
If I feel my values are so good, I will have no shame.
Losing pride can lead to shame, guilt, embarrassment and rejection by others. If our minds are trained to follow a certain hierarchy, we can judge ourselves harshly and believe that we are unwanted.
This can result in confusion, anger, distrust or negative emotion, let's say distance. Negative emotions, if we don't understand others and their perspectives or their intention to losing pride, distanced, distanced and things.
People may feel shame in guilt because societal accentations and internalized beliefs about what is important.
People may feel shame in guilt because of societal accentations and internalized beliefs about what is important and valued.
Being downgraded by those who are seen as superior or equal can lead to feelings of being misunderstood or embarrassed.
The symbol of lost pride refers to a state of being where one experiences feelings of shame, guilt, embarrassment or ostracization being ostracized.
The symbol of lost pride refers to a state of being where one experiences feelings of shame, guilt, embarrassment or being cast aside, cast away from a group or a relational section.
They have fallen short of their own or societal accentations. This can lead to feelings of being downcast or misunderstood and may stem from a comparison to other researchers or in internalized systems of belief in one's self worth.
The loss of pride can be a source of emotional pain and can impact one sense of identity and belonging.
This can lead to feelings of being downcast or misunderstood and may stem from a comparison to others or internalized systems of belief in one's self worth.
The value is variables and base lines. This is not defined yet.
Negation or deflection of interpersonal or value related problems in our lives cause this strange thing of inwardness to the self in way of isolation, quietude or withdraws to our personal or away from others.
Trade such as low self-esteem, pessimism or a tendency towards negative thinking can make a person more vulnerable to depression.
Environmental factors such as stress, trauma, loss or other interpersonal or value related difficulties can increase the risk of developing depression.
Unresolved conflicts, a sense of loss of control and a lack of societal support, social support can cause these symptoms.
Depression can also be triggered by significant life changes such as the death of a loved one, a divorce or a job loss, say or a loss or a friend, a division from people.
The thing of depression keeps us from ourselves and those would be cherished others. This is my way of massing into it.
When we are treated with respect and balance, when we have this thing of respect and balance for ourselves, it can lead to a positive feeling of empathy.
If you have balanced enough to yourself and you don't have to reflect on your own anymore, you can really think to everyone else because your problem is resolved.
You have all the time, all the effort to give to other people in a way of... I mean, we have our nature. There's many things to aspire ourselves to now.
But other people are a huge swath of it. The individual is important. The eye is important. We are built to be interrelational.
We are not so... The individual is kind of... The animization that we use so we so then expose to is detrimental to our beings.
We are interrelated by nature. The social effects or behavior are meant to our only best balance with other people.
They give to yourself alone and you have dysfunction. Not necessarily, but in say a sound has a cavern on the woods.
They are living in a perfectly happy life in our regard. They say they would self-rescribe that, yes, my life is fine. I am contented in this thing.
The biological traits, the physiological factors, you can relate to the norm.
You would see not failures or faults, but there are things that were meant to be relational on purpose.
It is built on trying mechanics. If you disrepresent yourself in that way, you are doing literally harm to your body in a way that is not so physically represented.
You might say you are fine, but there are factors you could use to discern how this person is doing and they would not be doing as well as someone that is well socialized.
Balance.
Okay, but if we are not treated fairly, it can lead to negative emotions such as maybe depression and enmity,
as well as internalized pain from repressed self-expression. This is complicated, I think I am not saying it right.
This can manifest physically in symptoms like headaches and migraines, I think.
These things are not entrusted to small stuff. You are not exercising well enough. You are not doing enough water.
You are not getting your vitamins. Those smaller attributes are falsely attributed to things that are really caused by larger causes of factors that bring us to socialized behavior.
If we are not self-expression enough, if we were to hold too much, I have never experienced this pain because I can speak on my own as well as I could.
Some people are not so unable to speak as they might. They would withhold more and more. The difficulty of expression goes, you want best for other people, but then you would hurt yourself in a way.
By withholding thought to one's own. There is difficulty there in how we are describing it.
It is not limited. It is not limited. It is doing great.
There is Western science and there is Eastern science. We have the strict separation. There is philosophy and there is rhetoric.
It is not so separate. There is truth to be found in these texts in this other half of our knowledge.
If we don't take any sort of heat to it, we are not learning as we could because Western science and developments of knowledge have separated itself from these other teachings.
It is like always reading a book that is written by a guy and never reading a book by a woman because in the act you are not seeing one half of all humanity and we are missing out of it.
There is other learnings you can take from. You can ignore the stuff that is not demonstrable, but the thing of a placebo is demonstrable.
What does that work? There are other factors that we have not described.

15 minutes. God damn it.
Balance can bring a sense of call and inner peace,
leading to a sense of mindfulness and presence.
When we are Saturn, we are able to live in the moment and not get caught up in worries or distractions.
This can be created by practices such as meditation, music, self-reflection.
I'd say socialization, talking to people, giving expression, doing your art.
The thing of balance is found in flow. The thing of balance is found in flow.
And there's another thing that's really important.
They're going to say it again. The thing of soliloquy.
I've said it a thousand times, but soliloquy is the thing we're missing.
The one that talks to himself is not necessitatedly insane.
The one and one talking to himself is giving...
If someone says, okay, sorry, sorry. If someone gets fucked.
No. If someone gets injured, say, if someone gets injured, they would say fuck.
Yeah, shoot. They give expression, give a quick little remark.
They give a...
That's so small. That's the effect of soliloquy.
You're giving knowledge and a thing. I've experienced pain.
Maybe you can avoid this pain too if I give expression to it.
That's the automated response.
But the thing of soliloquy.
In a lot of plays, you have an actor that would speak to an audience.
In the context of play, whether they're doing the actors,
they're the characters speaking to themselves.
That thing is not so far from our true nature.
We are rhetorical creatures.
We are expressionary in a way of language.
I think the thing of soliloquy is almost like accidental sharing of knowledge.
I got hurt. Maybe this will help you in a way.
The socialized learnings.
It's a lot more to it. A lot more to it.
But giving...
Giving...
There was expedited expressions.
They both...
I'm getting lost to it.
Achieving balance can help a person to feel fulfilled and satisfied.
It can improve one's overall well-being.
Yay.
Okay, wait.
Okay.
When we are centered, we are able to live in the moment.
And not get caught up in worries or distractions.
This can be aided by practices such as meditation.
However, if we lose our balance, we can become confused and disoriented,
feeling insecure.
And instability in our relationships with ourselves and others.
Oh, my God.
Maintaining a sense of balance is crucial for our overall well-being happiness.
Balance refers to the state of...
That's not perfect to it.
I don't remember what it was.
I could try to re-express that idea, but I don't feel like it right now.
Balance refers to the state of equilibrium where all elements are an equal portion leading to stability.
This concept can be applied in various aspects.
Can be applied in various areas of life such as mental and emotional balance.
Financial balance and physical balance, huh?
Say body balance.
You have a balance of yourself.
And internalized balance, then.
Yeah, internalized balance, too.
So achieving balance can help a person in relational balance.
Achieving balance can help a person to feel fulfilled and satisfied
and can improve one's overall well-being.
If you find good balance in a social partner,
in a partner partner, in front of you talking to him,
you might have good flow in the conversation.
You might have good engagement.
You might really enjoy every beat of your discussion.
And I think that's the thing of finding centeredness.
That's the thing of finding centeredness, finding centeredness, too.

This is a book, this is a book I would only feel not to recommend.
It's a book on the human nature and the need for social connection and it's titled loneliness.
The writing of this book was a collaboration involving two authors and a valuable form of social connection.
The only one was a participant in more than 20 years of scientific research.
This is the foundation of the story.
For the sake of convenience and clarity, we choose the first person to say that we've got little patience to it.
The writing of this book was a use system.
I have to know the language.
You can't always know it.
You can't do the entire book. Read it with elegance and maybe it's useful.
You have practice to calm the fuck down.
The writing of this book was a collaboration involving two authors and a valuable form of social connection.
The only one was participant in more than 20 years of scientific research.
This is the foundation of the story.
For the sake of convenience and clarity, we choose to write in the first person singular with John Cassiopo as the narrative voice.
That's interesting, that's very interesting.
You've forgotten the thing of the author.
That's cool too.
I like that.
We employ that convention in these knowledgements as well.
Even the research that I read, John Cassiopo, what do you mean?
Conducted was never a solo effort.
That research on social connection began in the early 1990s at Ohio State University where I thought,
we, my assigned to colleagues and I, began with a simple question of what are the effects of human association?
What are the effects of human association?
To address this question, we first conducted experiments and which individuals randomly assigned to be alone or with others of various kinds.
That's cool.
EG frangers, friends, friends, strangers, while performing a task.
We quickly surmised that it was an individual's perception of the social situation that mattered most.
We moved from an interest in social support to a human interest in perceived social isolation.
Loneliness has a model system for studying the role of the social world in human biology and behavior.
Doing so changed how we can see the human line as well.
The dormant metaphor for the scientific study of the human mind during the latter half of the 20th century has been the computer.
A solitary device with massive information processing capacities.
Our studies of loneliness, let us see them.
I left us unsatisfied with this metaphor.
Computers today are massively interconnected devices with capacities that extend far beyond the resident hardware and software for a solitary computer.
It became apparent to us that the telereceptors, EG, eyes, ears of the human brain have provided the sitting entire body, all the all the all the demanding parts that bring it.
The brain is so so so you could probably map the brain out of the body.
We used to have a pictures of the of the human key life.
But it goes almost directly to that.
The brain goes on our brain because our bodies are so complex.
And because our bodies in these interesting social buildings, social foundations that we built on, like whales and dolphins have.
And so I have elephants.
We built them more foundationally than interesting.
No, no, because it's different adaptations.
There's no certain, but these ones we could maybe communicate, tune to communication.
If there's noise to it, whales are playing with orchids.
Not with orchids, dammit.
How could you forget that?
Oh my god.
There's one species we think we communicate to.
They have five syllables, five expressions that it dammit.
It's like almost like more themes.
More themes are sentence structure.
You have five things, five words.
You have five clicks in a given section.
And there's like a break in it.
It's more complex than maybe even more code.
But the chat GBD recently has found a way to map on a model using non-model.
If they give you that information, they give you that context.
Then they can take a model of this strange communication.
Whether it's for food, whether it's for just acknowledgment,
whether it's for some sort of tail of distance, whatever behavior you imagine.
These wonderful creatures have developed themselves over the millennia.
And these models can reflect.
Actually, sorry.
They can...
Oh god.
Imagine how do you explain this shit?
The model that these machines would generate is reflective.
I used the word again.
The models these machines would generate.
These models are...
Oh god.
Thanks man.
Oh, I don't need to explain it again.
It's already explained.
It's in this word.
Our studies along with us left us...
Let us let us...
Let us us unsatisfied with this metaphor.
Computers today are massively interconnected devices,
with capacities they extend far and beyond that they're resident hardware
and software of a solitary computer.
It became apparent to us that the telereceptors, e.g. eyes and ears of the human brain have
provided wireless broadband and wireless broadband, inter-connectivity to humans from millennia.
Just as computers have capacities and processes that are transduced through a buddha, that
are transduced through, but got water.

To understand, to understand the full capacity of humans, one needs to appreciate not only
the memory and computational power and the brain, but its capacity for representing understanding
and connecting with other individuals.
That is, one needs to recognize that we have evolved a powerful, meaning making social
brain.
That is, one needs to recognize that we have evolved a powerful, meaning making social
brain.
The rhetorical machine, the notion that humans are in hand in social creatures is no longer
fantastical, but what precisely this means for, okay, it is not just, meaning making social
brain.
We have interconnected rhetoric, rhetoric that is interpersonal, rhetoric that is, you know,
all the ways of social media, social media has made it why it is recognized, which is
really, okay, and now we are bringing the knowledge together in this strange, tropical
model that will, oh my god, that is cool, okay, yeah, these rhetorical models, it is
not one model, there is going to be a lot of models, and you can already train, I saw
dude, two days ago, he said he trained his own model on GPT for 100 bucks, you can use
this data set to build out exponentially, they have no say in it, they can't control it.
No one person will be able to control this thing, which is wonderful, it is openly open forever,
like the internet, okay, the notion that humans are in hand in social creatures is no
longer fantastical, but what precisely this means for, for, for, for, for, for, for lives
in social, for societies is not, for they appreciate either, governments would, would,
worldwide, rely on economic advisors while publicly mocking scientific, meat studies

we run articles on, on social topics, some readers protest that we, we should stick
to real science, the editors went on, went on to say, ironically, we seldom hear these
complaints from, from working, from working, physical or biological scientists, they are
the first to point out that the natural universe, for all its complexity, is easier to understand
than the human being.
If social science seems mush, mushy, it is largely because the subject matter is so difficult,
not because humans are somehow not worthy of, of scientific inquiry.

Full text, then. The fact that loneliness is unpleasant is obvious.
And in Genesis, Adam and Eve's punishment for disobeying God was their exile from Eden.
There was nothing way to that either, but God damn it.
And over his men of morphoses, Zeus decided to destroy the men of the Bronze Age by flooding helles.
Do keelian survived by constructing a chest and with pyra, drifted to perineses.
Do keelian realized that however difficult or impossible it is to destroy the men of the Bronze Age by flooding helles.
Drifted to perineses. Do keelian realized that however difficult or impossible it is to live with others.
Even more difficult and more impossible it is however difficult or impossible it is to live with others.
Even more difficult and more impossible it is to live without them.
In complete loneliness, when Zeus granted him, granted him to choose what he wished.
He chose to create others. However, the notion that, oh, that's interesting, that's good text.
When Zeus granted him to choose what he wished, he chose to create others. Do keelian?
However, the notion that loneliness plays an important function for humans.
Oh, as you ask in third, you would love another soul to have interest in.
However, the notion that loneliness plays an important function for humans.
Just as physical pain hunger and thirst.
And that understanding this function and that understanding this function and its effects on social cognition hold some of the secrets to healthier.
Healthier, wealthier and happier lives is not so apparent.
The secret of this function, ok.
When Zeus, oh god damn it.
The notion that loneliness plays an important function for humans.

In Ovid's Metamorphosis, Zeus decided to destroy the men of the Bronze Age by flooding

Ducleon survived by constructing a chest, and, with Pira, drifted to Baraneses.
Ducleon realized that however difficult, or impossible it is to live with others, even

Incomplete loneliness, when Zeus granted him to choose what he wished, he chose to create
others.
However, that notion that loneliness plays an important function, however, the notion

of many brilliant wonderful colleagues, friends, students, and staff.
Our scientific studies of the causes, nature, and consequences of loneliness and social
connection have ranged across disciplinary, institutional, and international boundaries.
The research has included genetic, immunological, and endocrinologic, endocrinologic, endocrinologic,
endocrinologic, endocrinologic, endocrinologic, brain imaging, behavioral, cognitive, cognitive
emotional, biological, social, psychological, demographic, and sociological analyses.
The range of studies we sought to conduct exceeded my expertise.
So scientists from various disciplines have contributed their contributed, contributed, contributed, contributed their time, expertise, and insights to the work.
These scientific collaborations provided synergies and that transformed the research we were able to conduct and it provided the scientific story that unfolded before us.
We, William Patrick, the author being John T. Cappie, okay, I got you.
I wish to thank all the individuals who volunteered to participate in this research over the past two decades without participation assistance. None of this would have been possible.
The book describes stories of a number of individuals we studied or interviewed to give a face to our findings.
Bill and I have changed the names in various other details about these individuals to ensure that true identity is protected.
In case of Katie Bishop, in the individuals whose case we turned to revealing this book. We have used a composite character. We have used a composite character.
This was done to protect the confidentiality of the individuals who participated in our studies. Among those who were owed special recognition and thanked our Louise, okay.
Oh my God, I can't read it. I'm sorry. That's too much. Oh my God.
I want to see another one.
The views containing this book are those of the authors. Of course, but without funding for our basic scientific research, we would consider it less to stay on the topic of loneliness and social connection.
Finally, we thank Lisa Adams, who not only convinced us to undertake this book, but make it possible for us to do so.
And Rhea, who has grown up in a shale of Northern, who has been everything in my life.
Okay, this looks about life, loneliness and the power of social connection. It is perhaps ironic that while working on this book, we both lost our mothers.
Each lived, each lived a full happy life, and each passed peacefully surrounded by family and friends.
And although we expected their deaths set off to tsunami of feelings and emotions, as we dealt with the loss of our first connections to another person.
And dealing with their lost men is even more grateful than before to our family and friends for their kindness and generosity, more convinced of the fundamental importance of social connection, and even more empathetic to those who lived in the shroud of perceived social isolation.
We dedicated this book to the memory of our mothers, Mary Catherine Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo, and Bernice to her turner.
Okay, John T. Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Okay, John T. Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo, Cassiopo.
When I was still, when I am 56 and have been divorced for years, when I was still with my husband and told someone that I was lonely, they responded lonely.
They responded with, but you're married. I have learned the difference between being alone and lonely.
In a crowd at work, even in a family setting, I always feel lonely. It can be an overwhelming, it can be overwhelming at times, and a physical sensation.
My doctors have called a depression, but there is a difference. I read once that you are born alone and you die alone.
But what about all the years in between? Can you really belong to someone else?
Shopping won't do it, eating won't do it, random sex doesn't make it go away.
If and when you want any, if and when you find any answers, please write back and tell me.

Chapter 1, Lonely in a Social World, Katie Bishop grew up surrounded by aunts and uncles,
grandparents and cousins, and in a small community there was nothing, nothing if not closely
knit. Between family events, church events, sports, and music, her entire childhood was
spent among the same friendly people. I don't know how I'm going to make use of this
work. I'm in practice right now, this is practice. This is practice, but I think the live reading
it was very bad. That's fun.

Try to reference the UCLA loneliness scale for the enacted system.


====== REC037.txt ======
It is reproduced here in Figure 1.
The questions are not based on information, but on common human feelings.
Whether I refer to people who are lonely, or lonely, or high in loneliness, I mean those
who, regardless of their objective circumstances, score high on this pencil and paper test.
If you would like to take the test yourself, I explain how to explore it in page 4 on
page 2.
Okay, if you would like to take the test yourself, I explain how to score it, to score it
on page 4, in note 4, on page 271.
How do you reference this material?
Oh god, it is going to be a fucking absolute memory here man, that is terrifying.
All these books, they might not be available on the internet, maybe there is a few that
are not so open on the internet, but I am going to, if you transcribe it, put it to
models, fuck.
Yeah, that is where we are jumping, this is our access to books, that is how we have some
measure of advantage against people that would develop in other directions, not a advantage,
it is not an advantage, it is like, I don't know if there is any competition at all, the
competition is going to disappear altogether, but if you want to take stake in measures of
creation, you would find people that are apt to lead in directions to it, I got to finish
these projects, but I never will, I just got to find some people, I know, I know, I know,
I know, Nathan and Scott, and those, I would say, I would say, I would say, I would say
all those others on Discord, I would say Vincent, I would say, okay, will, I would say
will, I would say you do it if you are still awake, these projects are for everyone, I
would say, if you were still here, if he had to be here, fuck, that would be, he is just
having issues to, damn dude, that is cold, that is so cold, you have to include everybody,
you have to include everybody, but I can't do all at once, I don't want to do man, I got
to go to their house, I got to talk to them, but I got to bring people, I got to say
that I am, I can totally shoulder others to the effort, shoulder others to the effort,
that is what I want to say to them, I brought friends from once before, they are a thing
that was really important.

Okay, yeah. I'm not reading that diagram. That's the 20 questions. I guess I could. Yeah,
fucking. It's useful. Not fucking, sorry. How often do you feel that you are in tune with
other people around you? These are the questions that were, sorry, these are the questions
that were resolved. And the test, the only concept, this concept.

To measure a person that we love, okay, confidence, some measure of that, Jesus Christ.
To measure a person's level of loneliness, researchers use a psychological assessment tool
to call the UCLA loneliness scale, a list of 20 questions with no right, right, right,
wrong answers. It is reproduced here as figure one. The questions are not based on information,
but on very common human feelings. When I refer to people who are lonely or are high
in loneliness, I mean those who, regardless of their objective circumstances, score high
on this pencil and paper test. If you would like to take the test yourself, I explain how
to score it, on Note 4 page, in Note 4, on page 271. How often do you feel that you are
in tune? Look at the questions now. How often do you feel that you are in tune with the
people around you? How often do you feel that you lack companionship? How often do you
feel that there is no one you can turn to? How often do you feel alone? How often do you
feel part of a group of friends? How often do you feel that you have, you have a lot in
common with, with the people around you? How often do you feel that you are no longer
close to anyone? How often do you feel that your interests and ideas are not shared by
those around you? How often do you feel outgoing and friendly? How often do you feel close to
the people? How often do you feel close to the people? How often do you feel left out? How
often do you feel that your relationships with others are not meaningful? How often do you feel
that no one really knows you well? How often do you feel isolated from others? The general
test. How often do you feel you can find companionship when you want it? How often do you feel
that there are people who really understand you? How often do you feel shy? How often do you feel
that people around you but not with you? How often do you feel that people around you but not

that we can all slip in and out of loneliness.
That we can slip in and out of loneliness.
Feeling lonely at any particular moment simply means that you are human.
In fact, a sizable portion of this book is devoted to demonstrating that the need for meaningful social connection
and the pain we feel without it are defining characteristics of our species.
Loneliness becomes an issue of serious concern only when it settles in long enough to create a persistent, self-reinforcing loop of negative thoughts, sensations and behaviors.
Keep in mind, too, that feeling of isolation is not an unalloyed negative.
Keep in mind, too, that feeling of isolation is not an unalloyed negative.
Keep in mind, too, I lost it.
Keep in mind, too, that feeling of isolation is not an unalloyed negative.
The sensations associated with loneliness evolved because they contributed to our survival as a species.
To be isolated from your band, wrote John the Bulbley, the John Bulbley, the developmental psychologist, who pioneered the attachment theory and especially when young to be in quotation marks here.
And especially when young to be isolated from your particular characteristic is fraught with greater, greater danger.
Can we wonder then that each animal is equipped with an instinctive disposition to avoid isolation and to maintain proximity?
Shit.
Okay, so this mad plan to go see them, if it's an hour walk, let's fucking do it.
I'm going to think of them for an hour and I'm going to have the directions in my hand.
If I can't get a ride, then I'm going to have to walk. I'll just run out the directions and then just do it.
Because that's the only way I can get to them.
Fucking literally. I can't text them again. I can't, I can't.
It's going to bring more madness. They're not going to understand what I'm trying to get at.
This is a project. I need a project project. I need your help because I'm about to fucking homeless.
I will, I will make enough for us. I will make enough for us. I have to beg very practically, but I will.
Patreon Kickstarter, we have ways to, we have indie fund. There are ways to generate revenue for a project that would be interesting to a game audience.
It's really fucking easy.
Well, I'm going to, it's going to take forever to pitch this fucking game.
But if you guys don't listen, I've been tapering on this crap for seven years and I've got two games to go at.
And two random systems. Systems that are related to it.
And then like, we're going to train models on one of the systems and then we might have another system that we teach them on later.
But this, this other, this, the other have this, there's two, two things to it.
And it's too hard to explain. I can explain it now. Totally fucking explain it.

Yeah, so to be isolated from your to be isolated from your particular caretaker is fra with
fra with the greatest rate, greatest danger.
Cammy wonder then that each animal is equipped with an instinctive disposition to avoid
isolation and to maintain proximity.
The physical pain protects the individual from physical dangers, social pain, also known as loneliness.
It evolves for a similar reason because it protected the individual from the danger of remaining isolated.
Our forebearers depended on social bonds for safety and first I should turn my phone.
I should get the directions and just go because not I got the first fucking laundry dude.
Finish your laundry and maybe we have some some some matter of introduction because this is too much.
But you always fucking take care of it man, you've always taken care of it, it doesn't bring any closer.
You've got to fucking explain, you got to pitch it and you got to do it, you got to do the work.
If the world is changing overnight, if Chad GDP is doing this, we got to change ourselves too immediately.
What the fuck am I waiting for? I'm getting waiting, I'm getting waiting, I'm waiting to get evicted.
The fuck is point of that?
The action is bullshit now, but I want to read this book because I want to have, and because this is my meantime stuff,
this is more, more dumb projects, this is more, more tangents for stuff I want to do.
All the books transcribe and then I would have no books. All the models built into my game and I would, I would, I would need no computer.
I couldn't free myself and everything and it would just be, it would just be good to live.
It would just be good to live with my friends. That's the idea, that's what I'm, I'm gonna have the, I'm gonna have the work.
The, the computer is, is the means to continue to work on stuff, like the projects where people would keep going forever.
Um, for every, for as long as I want to, for as long as we keep working on them.
And you guys can make your own stuff too, I'll build a skeleton, I'll build a skeleton for, for, for, for, um, machine learning models.
That we could, we could, we could, we could, we could, we could have as character or characters in games.
And I have, I have, I don't know if I can explain it man, but I got enough, I got enough, I got enough, I got enough, accumulated, accumulated knowledge, accumulated documentation, accumulated writing, accumulated, um, I know we can model something out.
I know we can model something out, and I can, we can, we can, we can take him into these machines and model, modellen, model out in, in, in an A, an A, an A, E, I, artificial, intersectional intelligence, if, if, if, if, if, if chance, cheap, cheap, Gbt is, is the thing of, used the thing of, uh, in a, a,
again, a machine is, a model, a level of our best language language language utilization, um, been, uh, yep.
We can use it as a baseline, a core, the midline for, sorry, you can use chat to teach
all the other models.
You can use it to, because it's so good, but there's no emotive baseline, no evaluation
system.
There is no ghost in the machine right now.
There is no ghost in the machine right now.
As soon as we describe it values, and we give it emotions, we will still, still so, still
so proceed with the ghost in the machine, this is where it comes up, this is where it pops
up.
This is where we imagine intelligence as having emotions, I think we could do it, we could
do it, I mean it's going to start, it's going to start, I want games, games, fun games,
yes, but this is the fun thing, this is the coolest thing I want to do, we could totally
make artificial and emotional intelligence, totally, we have all the basic, I have sources
and sources to decide from, we could learn on, and then we have books and books, and we
have, I need an army of fucking scholars, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm
going to fetch the nation of Nathan and Scott, would you like to join my army of scholars,
is that what I'm going to fucking do, going to build the shit out, I need, I need people
researching, people, people, people, people who wanted to learn on stuff, we got, we got
it, we got to build our, build our, build, build the things we want to, we can build games,
we can build, we can use the machine learning as, we, as, we can build projects in whatever
direction we want to, because the machines are so incredible, um, yeah really, um, god
damn it. Just tonight, just tonight. I'm going to fucking talk to him.
To your laundry, iron your clothes, and proclaim yourself to be homeless.
Okay.
Fuck.

Keep in mind too, that the pain of isolation is not an unalloyed, not an unalloyed
negative.
The sensations associated with loneliness evolve because they contributed to our survival

It's been isolated from your band, Rode John Bobley, the developmental psychologist

young, to be isolated from your particular caretaker is fraught with greatest danger,

Can we wonder then that each animal is equipped with an instinctive disposition to avoid

Physical pain protects the individual from physical dangers.
Social pain, also known as loneliness, evolves for a similar reason.
It becomes a protected individual from the danger of remaining isolated.
Our four bears, our four bears, depended on social bonds for safety and for the successful
application of their other genres in the form of huspring.
Yeah, I'm reading mechanically, this is like, I want to go there now, but I cut a fish
to laundry.
I can read books for you now, I can come and do it, I guess machine will enable it.
I can read books and hang out in the sun and Patrick and Tulu and play games you want
to.
And we can anyhow do things and work on the projects we want to.
That's fucking cool.
Just want to peel, want to peel to them.
Go ahead and have a space for it, and this space is not going to work because they're going
to kick us out.
They're going to kick me out.

So if this is good, if this is good, if this is good, if this is good, if this is good,
if physical pain protects the individual from risk for dangerous social pain all
is known as loneliness evolved for a similar reason.
Because it protected individual from dangers, danger of remaining isolate of,
our forbearers, dependent on social bonds for safety and for the Patrick
genes in the form of offspring who themselves survive long enough to reproduce.
Feelings of loneliness told them when those protective bonds were endangered or deficient.
In the same way that physical pain serves as a prompt to change behavior, the pain of
the burning skin tells you to pull your finger away from the frying pan.
The loneliness developed as a stimulus to get humans to pay pay more attention to the social
connections and to get humans.
Antide reached a rate, I started to practice dude.
You got to read books perfectly.
You can't have fucking flaws to it.
If you're going to be a public statement like that you can't.
It's not going to be speaking, it's just a really good kickstart pitch right?
I'm not going to be a public figure.
I'm going to be a recluse dev, a recluse tinkerer, you know that's how they go.
I don't want to engage in that social stuff.
It's crazy social media.
It's too much.
It's too much.
It's too much.
It's going to get wild.
People who love this crap, I think.
You got to, not a veil of ignorance, but you want to have your intentions clear and open.
Sorry, you want to have your intentions to be.
Your intentions should be, as Seneca said, dammit.
He said, I just be clear and open to be, I used beautiful language, I liked it.
But to be absolutely transparent, to be, to be, to be, to be okay, yeah, to look okay.
The good corporation to fucking, if we're making any amount of money to do projects then I think I think it would be, I'd be very open about where it goes.
We would put our things, the towards things that are useful to us and we'll keep us, keep us in good care.
So all the people that would think to contribute, I would make sure that they are well, well, well undone.
So whatever we make, whatever we need, sorry, whatever we dammit, whatever we make, whatever they need.
We would, I want to enable anyone to everything they would need.
And we'll take the projects.
If, if, if these rhetorical machines, if these rhetorical machines are so extraordinary,
and they do everything that, that we, we suppose they can do, you can only build off the technology, you can only build off of it.
And I, I've got a, I've got a, I've got a good foundation.
It's just too much all at once.
Yeah, it's like the, the book you've been writing for years and years and years and years.
And now you're finally, now you're finally ready to show people.
But the book is not so complete.
It's, it's going to take many more pages.

Okay, physical pain protects the individual from physical taintures.
I don't acknowledge one of it.
I'm not cooperating the text.
I'm not cooperating the text, I'm just reading it, which sucks.
I'm thinking about other things.
I'm doing this text because it's useful.
Physical pain protects the individual from physical taintures.
I reckon recognition of it, say.
Social pain, also known as knowing this, evolved for a similar reason.
Because it protected the individual from the danger of remaining isolated.
Our forebears depended on social bonds for safety and for the successful replication of their genes in the form of offspring who themselves survived long enough to reproduce.
Feelings of loneliness told them when these protected bonds were endangered or deficient.
In the same way that the physical pain serves as a prompt to change behavior.
The pain of burning skin tells you to pull your finger away from the frying pan,
loneliness developed from a stimulus to get humans to pay more attention to their social connections,
and to reach out towards others to renew freighter or social bonds.
But here was a pain that prompted us to behave in ways that didn't always serve our immediate individual self-interest.
Here was a pain that got us outside ourselves,
widening our frame of reference beyond that moment.
In English, we have a word for pain, a word for pain and word for thirst,
but no single specific terms that made the opposite.
We merely refer the absence of these aversive conditions, which makes sense,
because their absence is considered part of the normal state.
Our research suggests that, not lonely,
our research suggests that the thing of in quotation marks here,
the thing of not lonely, there is no better,
more specific term for it, is also like not thirsty or not in pain.
Interesting.
I've read this before, but it's been a long time.
Very much.
I'm going to copy it from that now this time, this time around,
because I have different knowledge directly inside of it.
Suggested that not lonely,
one more time, that was good time.


====== REC044.txt ======
In English, we have a word for pain and a word for thirst, but no single specific terms
that mean the opposite.
We merely refer—sorry, we—sorry, dammit—we merely reference the absence of these
eversive conditions, which makes sense, because their absence is considered part of the
normal—normal state.
We do not research suggests that not lonely—suggest that not lonely in this other present
state of not thirst and not tired, or not in pain—God, I have so much stupid—there
is no—wow, that's interesting.

Okay, in English, we have a word for pain and a word for thirst, but no single specific
gamut, no single specific, specific term, terms that, why, why did that pop up?
That's so strange.
I said to find out I'm fine earlier.
And I mean the opposite, we really, there is no better, not thirsty, not in pain, very
much of the normal state.
Health and well-being for a member of this, health and well-being for a member of our species
requires, among other things, being satisfied and secure in our bonds with other people.
A condition of not being lonely, that for one of a better word, we call social connection.
And this idea of loneliness as, as, as social pain is more than a metaphor, but more than
a metaphor.
A functional magnetic resonance imaging, FMRI, shows us that, that the emotional region
of the brain that is activated when we experience rejection is, in fact, the same region.
The dorsal anterior singulate, that registers emotional responses to physical pain.
The discovery that, that, that feelings of social, social rejection, isolation and
rejections to physical pain, shared the same hardware, begins to suggest, suggest why.
Because loneliness becomes chronic, you cannot escape it merely by coming out of your shell,
merely by coming out of your shell, losing weight, getting a fashion makeover, or meeting,
or, or, or, or, or, or meeting, mister or miss, miss is right, nice, wow, I didn't, I was
blind to the text, first of my side, I, that would, that would have been helping out so
much, oh my god, yeah, the pain of loneliness is, the pain of loneliness is, the pain of
loneliness is, is, is, is, is, is a deeply destructive heart, heart, a deeply destructive
heart will work to the, but it is a deeply destructive heart, heart, the, the, the, the
destruction, both both both both both physiological, physiological and behavioral, can turn, turn
an unmet, and, turn an unmet need for connection, into, into a chronic condition, and when
it does, changing things for the betterment, for, for, for the betterment, requires taking
into account the full depth, and complexity of the role, role loneliness plays in our biology,
in, in our, and in our evolutionary history, following Katie Bishop's, lead, and trying
to make ourselves better, make ourselves better, and we, with, with fatty foods, uh, dammit.
Huh, dammit.
Following Katie, Katie Bishop's, uh, lead, this is, this is the thing of memory dude, why
it's so broken from me.
I, I, I should have remembered Katie Bishop, um, now following Katie, following,
following Katie Bishop, B, Bishops lead following, following, Katie, Katie Bishop's lead,
and trying to make, make our, make ourselves feel, ourselves feel better, with fatty foods
and reruns of friends will only make things worse.

Even ranging from neurologists to theologians from biostatitians and philosophers.
What the heck?
We're together to try...
Why did I miss that show last time?
I just read text that was good to me and that was not important.
We're together to try and understand the links between our psychological responses
and our social and even spiritual strivings.
Good text.
Bringing together researchers from so many diverse fields has enabled us to look closely at each piece of the puzzle,
but also to step back and consider the big picture in an integrated way.
Some of my colleagues have taken brain scanning beyond the pathway for pain.
To identify the specific, the specific is the path again.
The specific brain regions involved in empathy.
Other humans or even pictures of humans.
Okay, wait.
Yeah.
Other studies relying on FMI, FMI, show us that when humans see other humans or even pictures of other humans
our brains respond in a way that is different from when we see most other types of objects.
Interestingly, pet owners who really love their animals will show a glimmer of this brain response
when shown a picture of a dog or cat and images of humans.
This could do them.
Buddy, I gotta show you love it some ways.
You take it here yourself.
You listen right now, you hear me right now, but you don't look at me.
You don't look at me.
You gotta look at the wall, which is that sex.
I'm so sorry, buddy.
Good to know.
Hello?
Good to know.
You looked at me.
You looked at me.
Good to know.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I don't know.
I don't remember yet.
Do that.
You know.
Good to know.
I wouldn't help you.
It wouldn't matter.
It wouldn't matter.
You can't do anything.
There's no communication to a cat.
But there might be communication to a whale, which is fantastic.
Can we do that?
You can show him love.
You can show him affection.
You can show him good care and food and warmth and all the food and water and...
I'm sorry, but I need to get you snacks.
It's not shit.
It's fucking ironic that I can smoke weed and you have snacks.
I'm so sorry.
That's so bad.
You don't know what I'm doing.
It's like food in a different way for me.
It's a substitute.
It's been a substitute for a very long time.
This is like talking to the duck.
But it's awful.
Talking to the duck and programming.
It is still a liquid in another way.
And I can fix that right now.
Today.
I just gotta see my friends.
It's bullshit.
I still feel incredible for it.
It's not bullshit.
I'm the real smith friends and they maybe help.
There's addiction here though.
There's a small thing of addiction because it keeps popping up.
Why the fuck do any more?
It's like good food for me.
No, it wasn't.
It was for a bit.
No, it's not.
It's excess.
It's not needed.
I've broken all the tangents for it.
Sorry, the pants for easy doke mean.
Easy doke mean.
I can't make myself happy.
I gotta rely on this thing.
I gotta humor is very rare.
I don't fucking laugh, dude.
I don't laugh at all.
I do laugh, but it's relevational laughter, not humor laughter.
And then there's different humor, like I sometimes.
It's not gone.
It's hard to explain.
The thing of dopamine and the thing of THC.
We haven't done enough research.
It's occupying spaces of...
There's a point now where it doesn't...
I could take two days break.
Maybe three days.
Maybe it'd be normal again to it.
But I think there's definitely an upper limit to what it can do.
It's so strong at first because this is all...
You're going in double directions for processing.
Dopamine takes your brain in all directions.
Whatever curiosity you're pursuing, you would feel that out.
You would feel it out in that time.
But then there's differences in productivity.
There's differences in...
It reaches its own, really.
You can like any ADHD medication or any other solutions out there.
But there's a substance for focus.
This guy said he used Adderall for ADHD to focus the busy and hurried mind.
It would go in all directions and they couldn't keep task of any one thing.
I know I can so keep task of one thing.
So it's not ADHD.
There's a lack of focus sometimes.
It goes with the interrelational needs of our brains.
Ta-da!
I work with everything, but I still want to smoke.
That's the effect.
That's the effect.
That's the problem.
I don't think so fix it.
I'll see you guys tonight and then we'll fix it.

Yeah, try to help me with that, it can't be my case.
Help me!
What's going on?
Help me!
Help me!
How have you done anything?
Help me, I'm sorry.
What happened to you?
No, I didn't know what to say.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

how to work a room chapter 4 working a room successfully depends on seeing the roadblocks

roadblocks the roadblocks


====== REC067.txt ======
You know, working a room successfully depends on seeing the roadblocks, responding with the appropriate remedies, and identifying the potential benefits.
But in the end, what gets us through the night is the dynamic duo of charm and chutzpah.
I can hear it now, charm and chutzpah in the same breath.
They're not a contradiction in terms of behaviors.
They're a contradiction in terms of behaviors, not true.
Chutzpah, I look at the courage to converse.
The old negative connotations of chutzpah are goal, nerve, a brazeness, brazeness, braziness, braziness that is intrusive and offensive.
To me, chutzpah is not aggression, rudeness, disrespect, or bulldozing.
It is simply the courage to take risks.
Chutzpah allows us to make the first ice-breaking comment that opens the doors to conversation.
It gives us the courage to walk into the party, fundraiser, aerobics class, or meeting.
Take a deep breath, introduce our intranet and introduce ourselves to someone, and introduce ourselves to someone.
Can it help you work a room?
What else is working a room?
Would you wish on your children?
You bet.
They will be ahead of the game when they start working rooms, and they will.
Chutzpah is the cornerstone of confidence.
Chutzpah is the cornerstone of confidence.
In the 1980s, Chutzpah had been elevated to the status of a management tool.
In getting Chutzpah, having November 1992, psychologist Elliott Jaffa identified Chutzpah as an overlooked, personal quality that makes a successful manager.
Jaffa says that Chutzpah allows us to risk rejection.
Risk rejection asks for what we want and express ourselves.
It gives us the strength to pick ourselves up, and start all over again.
Charm.
Charm, you and the Queen mum.
Here is what Webster has to say about charm.
It's a verb to captivate, delight, attract, please.
As a noun, a power to gain affection.
These definitions make most people shout.
Where do I sign up?
In charm school, I was taught how to dress, walk, apply, apply makeup, smile, behave, and be well-mannered.
These things are important, she says, but charm includes something more.
An elusive quality which draws us to people and makes us believe they care about us.
It's easier to define charm in terms of who has it and who does not.
President Nixon doesn't have it. President Reagan does.
Mike Dittka doesn't have it. Sugar Ray Leonard does.
Betty Davis doesn't have it. Helen Hayes does.
I don't know who those are, but okay.
Charm is a combination of warmth, good nature, positive attitude, a good sense of humor, charisma, spirit, energy, and an interest in others.
My friend and associate, Cheris Sputuin has it.
When she own the fame mansion in, every guest felt welcomed.
People want to be around her.
Charm is the ability to convey a type of caring that comes from the heart and soul.
An advice colonist wants to find class as the ability to make people of all walks of life feel comfortable.
Class isn't that thing.
Shirt's fun charm, if you have class.
To me, the definition also applies to Charm.
Charm and Shirt's fun.
The person who personifies Charm for me is the queen mother.
Queen Elizabeth's second mother, Robert Lacey, author of Queen Mother, described her on the today show as having the gift of making you feel she's been waiting all week to meet you.
I would not interest him.
That truly is a gift.
The art of conveying interest, concern, and caring for another person.
When we work a room, a party, a convention, we're a jogging track.
We must be keenly aware of other people's feelings.
Ignoring someone because the title of their name tag doesn't impress us is a cardinal sin.
When we work a room, a party, a convention, or a jogging track, we must be keenly aware of other person's feelings.
Ignoring someone because the title on their name tag doesn't impress us is a cardinal sin.
Now, one in one is three.
When Shirt's fun and Charm come together, it's synergistic.
The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
When Shirt's fun and Charm come together, it's synergistic.
The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
You don't just have Shirt's fun and Charm, you have magic.
One in one is three.
You care about other people, and you have the courage to walk up to them and let them know it.
That's a powerful combination.
That's a powerful combination.

The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
You don't just have Shirt's fun and Charm, you have magic.
You care about people, and you don't have the courage to walk up to them and let them know it.
That's a powerful combination, and one that enriches everyone's concern.
That's a powerful combination, and one that enriches everyone's concern.
The dynamic duo of Shirt's fun and Charm isn't too do or a technique.
It's something we all have, and that we've developed to a greater or lesser extent.
Now is the time to let it out and spread it around.
There is no more effective way to work a room to give on that thing.
Reminder. Shirt's fun and Charm are the dynamic duo at the heart of working a room successfully.
We all have these qualities. Practice makes them stronger.
They let us work a room with style and grace, and ultimately are what attracts people to us.
That's a powerful combination, and one that enriches everyone's concern.
That's a powerful combination, and one that enriches everyone's concern.

Chapter 5, Mr. or Mrs. Sleeze, works at room.
How not to do it?
Chapter 5, the people who are the most successful at working at room
are those who genuinely like respect and trust people.
Okay, try again.
The people who are most successful,
who are most successful at working at room
are those who genuinely like respect and trust people.
When we don't really care about people,
they sense the insecurity,
insincereity, insincereity,
and really take kindly to it.
Oh, projection.
Oh, try again.
The people who are most successful at working at room
are those who genuinely like respect and trust people.

Really take kindly to it.
Being slimed.
And she says, being slimed in quotation marks
had a recent benefit.
A man who has had a recent benefit.
Had a recent benefit.
A man who is involved in this community approached me and told me
that he really knew how to work a room
and had a great deal experience at it.
knowledgeable, charming, and smooth on the surface. But as we spoke, his eyes moved around
the room to see who else was there, and I sensed he wasn't about to waste time with people
he didn't consider important. Everything he did seemed calculated. He heard my words
and responded, but he didn't really listen. When he spoke, mostly about himself, his past,
his ideas, his successes, his goals, he locked me in his eyes, he locked me in with his eyes
that felt like lasers. Like Bill Murray in God, like Bill Murray in Ghostbusters. I felt like
I'd been slimed. Mr. Sleeze was a user and a loser. Keeping up.
Mr. or Mrs. Sleeze disguises. We've all met the Sleezes at parties, meetings, meetings,
and conferences. They may wear a thousand dollar briani or channel suits instead of the proverbial
shark skin. They may look perfectly conservative and stylish. They may even appear to be the
prince or princess of our personal or professional dreams. They may say all the right things,
but you just know they don't really care about you or your career. They almost never
follow through with what they promise. Their behavior does not support their words.
University educator, Ernie Bogg-Martin told a seminar group,
behavior that doesn't support words actually subverts them. Behavior that doesn't support words
actually subverts them. If what we do doesn't support what we say, we are worse off than if we
hadn't said anything at all. The Sleezes of the world come in many forms. They are male and female,
young, old, and middle-aged, wealthy, and struggling. They can be anyone. They can be anyone.
The common denominator. They have no respect for anyone who can't do something for them.
They are just trying to make their contact quota, and it shows.
Learning from Sleeze. Is there a lesson in Mr. or Mrs. Sleeze's behavior?
You bet. The technical skills of working a room are not enough. The warmth and desire to help
must be genuine and sincere. I hate to sound like grandma, but when in doubt, apply the golden rule.
Treat other people as you would want to be treated. It's old-fashioned, but it's easy,
but it's easy, true, and almost feel safe.
I say almost feel safe because there are some people, only a few, fortunately, who don't care
how we treat them because they don't care about us. They treat everyone with a chilling
combination of disregard and disdain. They don't expect anything different from others.
They are the roadblock. People who tempt us not to risk rejection.
All you can do is apply remedy number four and move on. You've got to have Chutzpah, charm confidence.
Roadblock number four.
Oh, no, my bad. Roadblock number four is better safe than sorry, risking rejection.
No one wants to be rebuffed or ignored.
Our ego is around the line when we extend ourselves to others because there's always the possibility
that they won't be interested in talking with us. But mother's dire warnings that we're better
safe than sorry puts a real damper on risk. And risk is the name of the game when you're working a room.
I like to think of this risk as a challenge. If you don't have anything on the table, you never win.
If you don't take the risk and reach out to people, you never make new friends or contacts.
We risk our lives at the time, all the time on the freeway. Most of us are strong enough to withstand a temporarily chipped ego.
The truth is a very few people will be openly hostile or rude if for no other reason than its bad business.
So to risk rejection, so you work up your nerve to approach a stranger, you smile, say hello, introduce yourself.
The other person casts you at it, casts you at disinterested glance and screams, who cares.
This hurts. No one wants to be rebuffed or ignored.
Okay, so back to it. No joking matter. Humor that hurts.
The jokester who works a room with inappropriate humor has the same effect as insect repellent.
An associate who might call Linda attended a business reception when she encountered a local attorney who was
active on the organization's education committee. This Mr. Cee's prototype made quite an impression for his offensive sense of humor.
Gary came up to me when I was talking to another woman, woman business owner, Linda told me.
He said hello and asked how I was. I hadn't been out, hadn't been to our committee meeting that month due to a severe case of the flu.
So when he asked how I was, I said that I was feeling much better. Laughing at his own wit, he replied,
aren't you glad that time, that time of the month is over. The sad thing is, wow, the sad thing is that he actually thought he was funny.
My friend and I were so, we're both offended. We simultaneously rolled our eyes and walked away from Mr. Bugs' prey.
His idea of humor was insulting, and you can be sure I would never refer any business to him.
And if anyone asked me about him, I would be definitely silent.
Now, fatal flaws. There is good news and bad news for Mr. and Mrs. Cee's.
The good news is that, if being remembered is the goal, they achieve it. People do remember.
The bad news is that they are being remembered for all the wrong reasons.
The Sleses leave a negative impression, and that really enhances one's social life or business network.
In addition to being remembered as an insincere user and an unfailing manipulator,
Mr. and Mrs. Cee's often brings to the meeting or party a whole bag of unpleasant social tricks.
These fatal flaws include disparaging or put down humor, one drink too many,
monopolizing someone's time, wearing a t-shirt or jeans at a suit and tie event,
wearing a low-cut, revealing or unfashionably tight dress at a business function,
moving around the room with a cigarette or cigar in hand.
Overloading his or her plate with a buffet and returning too many times.
Eating, drinking, and talking simultaneously.
Sizing people up by the title on their name tag and moving away conspicuously if they
aren't important enough or perceived as a decision-maker.
Patronizing any individual or group, especially women, the elderly, minorities, or the physical challenge.
Loudness, the hard sell, not falling through on offers or promises.
Complaining about the room, the food, the other attendees, etc.
Don't complain, how to handle a cease, confront them, I think.
But as she says, she's that confront them or reject them, maybe.
But extricate yourself quickly. There is no reason for you to put up with this kind of behavior,
nor to waste your time being gracious to someone who doesn't even know or care that you are being
gracious to them. Trying to be polite, but remember that a sleaze is entirely sensitive to the
differences, difference between polite and impolite. The most important thing is to get away.
Reminders, Mr. or Mrs. Sleeze can chop up anywhere and can come in a variety of disguises.
You would recognize them by their uncounty ability to make others uncomfortable,
by their concentration on themselves rather than on other people,
by their offensive humor and or behavior, and mostly by their lack of genuine caring or follow-through.
The best way to handle a sleaze is to extricate yourself from the situation as quickly as possible
and to move on to more pleasant company.
Chapter 6. Preparation of planning and presence.
You are said to go. You've identified the roadblocks, applied the remedies,
and seen the specific benefits of working in the room.
And seen the specific benefits of working in the room.
Polished up your shutzba and your charm and learned to avoid either resembling or spending time
with Mr. or Mrs. Sleeze. What's next? Before you rush out into the night or the afternoon
or the morning, take some time to prepare yourself. The old army saw about the five
peas. Also holds true for business and social events.
Prior planning prevents poor performance. Prior planning prevents poor performance.
Barbara Waltress stresses the importance of preparation and how to say practically
anything to practically anybody. Unlike some interviewers, she doesn't make do with information
provided by the producer or research department. She does her own research and is extensive
and it is extensive enough that she is almost never taken by surprise.
She is, she always prepares more questions.

So chapter 7, 7 strategies from jumpstart to smooth stop.
You've done your preparation, you've done your preparation, but what if your internal
engine starts to stall with a thought of actually walking in the door.
These 7 strategies will give you a quick jumpstart and bring you through the event to a smooth
stop.
Through the event to a smooth stop.
Strategy 1, the entrance, the entrance, grand or otherwise.
What time should you arrive?
Arrival?
Arrival time is usually based on the starting time of the event, not on making a conspicuous
entrance.
There is no such thing as being fashionably late to a meeting.
When you arrive at the event, take a deep breath, stand tall and walk into the room.
Hanging out in the doorway creates a fire hazard, a traffic problem, and the impression that
your timet about coming in.
There may or may not be an official greeter, anticipate that there will not be one and enjoy
the pleasant surprise if there is.
Speaker and author Judith Briles recommends volunteering to be on the greeting committee
yourself.
That way you get to meet everyone because it's your job.
If you are shy, this gives you something to say to people right away.
Give the room a quick one-sover.
Where is the bar?
Where is the food?
Where are people congregating?
Where can you position yourself to meet the most people?
A professional speaker who addresses audiences of thousands once told me he had great difficulty
attending cocktail parties and talking to people one-on-one.
His solution is to position himself between the entry and the buffet table so that everyone
has to walk by him to get to the food.
He is always surrounded by people.
That's clever.
That's very clever.
Once you are in the room and look around for people you know, look around for people
you know.
If you see someone who looks vaguely familiar, go up and introduce yourself.
Find out if that person is who you thought he or she was.
Find out if that person is who you thought he or she was.
It's interesting.
There is no point in wondering what would happen if?
What would happen if?
One of two things will happen.
You will be right and renew the acquaintance or two.
You meet a new person.
Chat for a while.
And move on.
Strategy two.
The buddy system.
If the thought of entering a room gives you the shakes, try the buddy system.
And make a deal with a friend who must also attend these events and go together.
But don't limit your arrangement to having someone with whom to walk in the door.
The buddy system can be a great way to work a room.
If you do some prior planning and strategizing.
So buddy strategies.
One of the main advantages to going to an event with a buddy is that you can introduce
one another around.
You may know people your buddy doesn't know and vice versa, even if neither of you know anyone.
You will both meet people in the course of the event and can introduce each other to
your new friends.
Brush up on your introduction skills so that you present your buddy as a pleasant, interesting
person who has something in common with the other attendees.
This means listening to people to find out what their interests are.
Give people enough information about your buddy to begin a conversation.
This means listening to people to find out what their interests are.
Give people enough information about your buddy to begin a conversation.
And use a positive tone of voice.
Two.
Make sure your buddy does the same.
Your buddy's introduction of you should be as enthusiastic and informative as yours is of him or her.
I feel to do this once.
I feel to do this once.
A colleague and I agreed to promote each other with our introductions.
My introduction of her had her one wave short of walking on water.
But her enthusiastic introduction of me sounded like a preview of my eulogy.
It was deadly.
Don Hansen, a San Francisco business consultant, says that some people are legitimizers,
simply by virtue of who they are and how they introduce other people.
Legitimizers.
They are individuals with a certain amount of status and they know how to present other people to best advantage.
Three.
You and your buddy would want to split up as soon as possible.
If you behave like Simon's twins, your ability to walk the room and meet people is limited.
You'll meet only half the number of people and those you do meet will think you are joined at the hip.
Four.
Develop a rescue signal so that you and your buddy can regroup to assess and re-strategize.
And help extricate one another from conversations that have gone on too long.
It is fantastic.
Oh my god.

So Sean, this is how to work a room. Chapter 7. Seven strategies from jumpstart to smoothstop.
There's a section here, I thought it was important.
The strategy is to work a room. Your entrance is important, grand or otherwise.
But the buddy system, I think you have confidence down, so I don't need to elaborate on that.
But the buddy system, the buddy system itself, if the thought of entering a room gives you the shakes, try the buddy system.
Make a deal with who must also attend these events and go together.
But don't limit your arrangement to having someone with whom to walk in the door.
The buddy system can be a great way to work a room.
If you do some prior planning and strategizing, so buddy strategies.
One of the main advantages of going to an event with your buddy is that you can introduce one another around.
You may know people, your buddy doesn't know, and vice versa.
Even if neither of you know anyone, you'll both meet people in the course of the event and can introduce each other to your new friends.
Brush up on your introduction skills so that you present your buddy as a pleasant, interesting person.

Use a positive tone of voice.

Your buddy's introduction of you should be as enthusiastic and informative as yours is of him or her.

Don Hansen, a San Francisco business consultant, says that some people are legitimizers.
Simply by virtue of who they are and how they introduce other people.
They are individuals with a certain amount of status and they know how to present other people to best advantage.
Number three.
A junior buddy will want to split up as soon as possible.
If you behave like Simon's twins, your buddy to work a room and meet people as limited.
You'll meet only half the number of people.
And those you do meet will think you are joined at the hip.
Number four.
I develop a rescue signal so that you and your buddy can regroup to assess and re-strategize.
And help extricate one another from conversations that have gone on too long.


====== REC072.txt ======
Now, stretch number three, the white knuckle, the white knuckle drinker and other accessible
folk.
You are inside the room and you and your buddy have decided it's time to split up.
Where do you turn?
What do you, who do you talk to?
You don't recognize a soul and feel conspicuous standing alone.
The temptation at this point is to find a place near the wall and try and to look
like a paint chip.
Initiating conversation can be challenging.
Remember our mothers taught us not to talk to strangers, but we've remedied that.
We also fear rejection and perhaps suspect that we are not interesting.
We're too attractive enough.
But we've reminded those, we've remedied those things too.
And because we are attending this reception in order to work the room,
we can't afford to be wallflowers.
Now, it's time to step out there on our own, work up our courage and do something.
What I do in this situation is look for the white knuckle drinkers.
If you want to manage the mingling at any event, look for people who are standing around
with white knuckles.
It doesn't matter whether their cup or glass contains a drink, wine, coffee or water.
They are clutching it so tightly that their knuckles are white.
Are they scared to death and they are always alone?
These people usually welcome you, your conversation, because you save them from anonymity and anonymity.
No one else is talking to them.
If you walk up and start a conversation, you're doing a good deed and also moving yourself
away from the wall.
I'm seized the moment.
Make eye contact, smile and say hello.
Don't treat these people as losers.
In most cases, they aren't.
Maybe they are just shy or anxious.
Make your conversation so fascinating that other people are drawn into your little group
and expand the circle.
She says, Theresee Godfrey, a Hanululu-based consultant and speaker says, when you care about
other people's comfort more than your own, your clumsiness and self-consciousness go away.
Well, remember, the white knuckle drinker is more uncomfortable than you are.
And we'll be delighted with practically anything you have to say.
That is so good.


====== REC073.txt ======
Strategy number four. Strategy number four. Name tags that pull. While there are still mixed feelings about name tags, they are very important for business and social events, she says.
This is old text, but name tags have some obvious benefits. Use them. You can address a person by name, which is always preferable.
They provide information you can use to begin conversation. In quotation she has. Company, job, title, location, area of specialty, etc.
The value of information is not just your name. In this context it is not just your name. It is information about your profession, about your...
You are a negotiated interest. You are a prospective negotiated interest.
If you see that from your face, but aren't sure if the person is who you think he or she is, you can sneak a peek at the name tag.
At many trade shows, cocktail parties, and other events, name tags are provided. The person's name should be large and bold enough to be visible even if you are standing a few feet away.
The company name is often a bit smaller and you have to get closer to read it. Many civic organizations and some churches use name tags to encourage mingling.
Sometimes the name tags are color coded to distinguish members from guests or new members.
An unwritten rule is that members seek out guests and new members and make them feel welcome.
According to Rick Enos, a senior member of the guardsman, a San Francisco civic organization.
You might take a cue from this rule and make yourself an unofficial greeter of guests and new members.
Fork, it's gonna hot.

Discovering what to say, the problem in previous chapters, we have looked at the process
of rhetoric and then at each of the main elements in the rhetorical situation.
That's so welcome on dude, the problem, in the previous chapters we have looked at the
process of rhetoric and then at each of the main elements in the rhetorical situation.
Content, he says content, content, audience and persona, persona.
Understanding all these things certainly helps us understand the rhetorical process.
It helps us understand and evaluate our own rhetoric as well as the rhetoric of others.
Moreover, it has given us some suggestions about our own writing.
Fuck, come on dude.
Center.
Understanding, understanding all these things, all these things, certainly helps us understand the rhetorical process.
It helps us understand and evaluate our own rhetoric as well as the rhetoric of others.
I'm more over.
It has given us some suggestions about our own writing.
Is it too mixed?
Yeah, dang dude, come on.
It just takes me a bit.
However, our central problem is still ahead of us.
How do we know what to say and how to say it?
How, in a given rhetorical situation, do we decide on the best strategy for achieving our
rhetorical goal?
Rhetorical goals.
How, boy, practice, it's good, and better, but there you go.
This problem is the problem of discovery, or as classical rhetoric, rhetoric, rhetoric, rhetoric, rhetoric, rhetorications, rhetorications, often called it invention.
This problem is the problem of discovery.
I'm trying again, that was the fifth interesting.


====== REC075.txt ======
This chapter in those that follow will attempt to provide a general method for composing and expressing.
This chapter will specifically focus specifically specifically focus on how the major elements in the rhetorical situation, content, situation.
This chapter will specifically focus on how the major elements in the rhetorical situation, content, audience, persona, interact to produce effective rhetorical writing.
You will learn how to consider each in producing and producing a discourse.


====== REC076.txt ======
I can bring it down.
I have a purpose.
Before discussing three major elements in the rhetorical situation, we should probably
consider the hidden element in the rhetorical situation.
The rhetorical situation, oh boy, it's worse.
It's worse.
I need to work on this.


====== REC077.txt ======
Yeah. Discovering what to say. This is on rhetoric, theory and practice for composition.
While the rest is not. Now the problem. In the previous chapters we have looked at the process of rhetoric and then at each of the main elements and the theoretical situation.
He says content, audience and persona. Understanding all of all these things certainly helps us understand the rhetorical process. It helps us understand and evaluate our own rhetoric as well as the rhetoric of others. Moreover, it has given us some suggestions about our own writing.
However, our central problem is still ahead of us. How do we know what to do and how to say it?
What to do? What to say and how to say it? How in a given rhetorical situation do we decide on the best strategy for achieving our rhetorical goals?
This problem is the problem of discovery or as classical rhetoricians often called it invention. This chapter in those that follow will attempt to provide a general method for composing and expressing.
This chapter will specifically focus on how the major elements in the rhetorical situation, content, situation, content, audience, persona interact to produce effective rhetorical writing.
We will learn how to consider each in producing a discourse.
Before discussing the three major elements in the rhetorical situation, we should probably consider the hidden element in the rhetorical situation.
The writer's purpose is a less objective element than the other three. It is often more difficult to identify than content, audience, or persona.
For purpose does not exist on paper or in the social framework of the rhetorical situation.
Rather it exists in the mind and the heart of the writer.
This may not be clear to the audience or even to the writer himself, though he certainly has some general sense of purpose.
It can be considered as really two different purposes. He says an external purpose and an internal purpose.
It is so supposed and the framework systemic purpose.
The external purpose is the rhetorical goal. What the writer hopes to accomplish in the external or real world.
The internal purpose is the rhetorical strategy that the writer uses to achieve his goal.
In deliberative rhetoric, the external purpose is some action.
For instance, a writer may want you to vote for Jones by a Hershey bar. Stop littering or stop smoking.
The writer is trying to get you to stop smoking. He has a wide choice of internal purposes or strategies open to him.
He could present extensive evidence on how harmful smoking is to your health. He could attempt to scare you out of smoking by presenting a conversation between a widow and her young children.
We are asking her when daddy will be home again. He could present the personal testimony with a smoker who is dying from lung cancer or some other dreadful disease that results from smoking.
These are rhetorical expressions.
In a judicial theoretical situation, the external purpose is not so much an action as a judgment.
The writer wants you to conclude that Ralph King did not kill Harry at Johnson that Leigh F. Erickson did land in North America before Columbus came to the New World.
That name should be restricted in history. Or that alien creatures are visiting Earth.
In such situations, the internal purpose may be quite close to the external purpose.
For instance, if a historian is trying to convince other historians that Leigh F. Erickson came to America before this other dude, his internal purpose will probably be to present evidence of Erickson's visits.
I hope this other dude didn't do as much damage, but I don't know history.
The rest of the difference between the two purposes might seem small. In a courtroom, however, a lawyer might attempt to persuade his audience.
The jury, that his client is not guilty by appealing to the jury that his client is not guilty by appealing to their emotions.
As comedian Don Adams once asked an old male jury about an attractive woman accused of killing her husband, is that the face of a murderous?
Is that the figure of a murderous? Are those the legs of a murderous?
The important thing for you, as a writer, is to be aware of just when your external purpose is, and then, to decide what,
the general approach to strategy will help you achieve, in that purpose.
Good attempt, but.
You're not processing it. You're not processing any of it.
Let's look at the letter about abortion. The letter that we looked at in chapter 3.
Funny, but when a woman discovers she's pregnant and is glad, she says she is going to have a baby.
When she doesn't want it, she calls it out, and has it terminated by an abortion.
Yeah, sorry, yeah. That shows how a change in wording paints that we should have easy methods for, you know, saying otherwise easier.
Male birth control, why don't we have male birth control by now?
That shows we do, we do, right? We do, technically. That shows how a change in wording.


====== REC078.txt ======
Oh, that's tough, I just read it like nothing, oh my god.
When most of us, when most of us began to write in right, when most of us began to write
in a rhetorical situation, we started with a vague notion of a position or purpose.
We are against abortion or a pollution.
We want fewer restrictions in the dormitories or higher salaries for the work we do.
We want others to know that Martin Luther King Jr. was a great man or that the gauntlet was
a bad movie, but unless we stop to think of what our specific goal is and what strategy
we can use to accomplish that goal, we are likely to write in effectively.
If we merely write the first thing that comes into our minds, our writing will probably
satisfy us without persuading anyone else.

Chapter 1.


====== REC082.txt ======
chapter 1, be like happiness isn't the absence of negative feelings. Happiness feels
intolerably elusive for many of us. Like fog, you can either see it from afar, dense,
and full of shape, but upon approach, its particles loosen, and suddenly it becomes out of
reach. You know, even though it's all around you, we put so much emphasis on the pursuit
of happiness, but if you stop and think about it, to pursue it is to chase something
without a guarantee of ever catching it. A guarantee is without a guarantee of ever catching
it. Dang it. We put so much emphasis on the pursuit of happiness, but if you stop and
think about it, to pursue it, to pursue it is to chase something without a guarantee of
ever catching it. Up until about six years ago, I was fervently and inefficiently chasing
happiness. My husband, Jim and I, were living in San Jose, California, with our two-year-old
son and a second baby on the way. The author, our name, Jennifer Moss, Jennifer Moss. On paper,
our life appeared rosy. Still, I couldn't seem to find joy. I always felt so guilty about
my sadness. My problems were embarrassingly first world. First world, she says. Yes, yes,
yes. We have to recognize that. It is immense privilege. We are so fortunate. We don't recognize
this. We tend not to. We cannot. Imagine. Then in September 2009, my first world tilted.
Jim fell severely ill. Her husband. He was diagnosed with swine flu, H1N1, the West Nile virus.
Then, then Gullian Berry syndrome, due to his compromised immune systems. Jim never
worried about his death. I did. Well, of course, when we were told Jim's illness was letting
up, he would put on a face ward. He never worried about it. He lived in the moment. He says
he does. And he will. And he did. I'm sure. I think that was a good ending to this. My
bed. I read it before. We knew that prognosis meant the end of Jim's career as a pro lacrosse
player. What we didn't know was how we'd pay the medical bills or how much energy Jim would
have for parenting. With 10 weeks, with 10 weeks to go until the baby arrived, I had very
little time to think and reflect. Jim, on the other hand, only had time. He was used to
moving at high speeds, both in life and on the field. So minutes passed like hours in
the hospital. He kept busy with physical and occupational therapy, but he was also in
need of psychological support. He put out a note to people and his social networks asking
them for reading suggestions. They would help him to heal, to mentally heal. Suggestions
flowed in. Books and audio tapes were delivered besides a bed-delivered bedside, with notes
about how they'd helped so much. After whatever difficulty this person had, also experienced
but ever came. After whatever difficulty this person had, also experienced but ever came.
Also had experience but ever came. Jim would spend his days reading motivational books
from Tony Robbins and Oprah for watching Ted Talks like Jill Bolte Taylor, My Stroke
of Insight. Jill Bolte Taylor's My Stroke, about the impacts of brain trauma. He would
analyze spiritual books by Ted D-Pax Chopra, Deepak Chopra, Chopra, and Dalai Lama. Or review
side to the research papers about happiness and gratitude. Written by researchers, Martin
Siegelman, Sean Acker, Sanja Lio Bromsky, and many others. There was a repeated theme
throughout all the literature, gratitude. It would grieve in and out of the science, the
true stories and the drivers for his success. Jim responded by starting a gratitude journal
of his own. He got very thankful, thankful for the people who changed his sheets, thankful
for the family that would bring him hot meals at dinner, thankful for the nurse who would
encourage him, and thankful for the extra attention his rehab team would give him on their
own time. He was thankful for the nurse, but that's nice. The team once told Jim that
they were only putting in extra time because they knew how grateful it was for their efforts.
He asked, that's not a good job, dude. He asked that I participate in his approach, and
because I wanted to help him heal. Help him heal so badly, and I was seeing how hard
it was for him. I tried hard to be in a positive place when I came into his world inside
that hospital room. I wasn't always at my best. I sometimes resented that I couldn't
break down, but after a while I started to see how rapidly he was getting better. Although
our paths were in congruent, we weren't making it work. I was coming around. It was shaky
and scary, but when Jim walked out of the hospital on crutches, he stubborn and refused
the wheelchair, only six weeks after he was rushed by ambulance to the ER. We decided
there was something more to his healing than just unlock. One of those early books that
influenced Jim was Seagalman's Flourish. Seagalman's Flourish. A psychologist and former
president of the American Psychology Association, Seagalman was responsible for defining the
term perma, the root of many positive psychology research projects around the world. The acronym
stands for the five elements essential to lasting contentment. So positive says positive
emotion, your peace, peace, gratitude, satisfaction, pleasure, pleasure, inspiration, hope, curiosity,
love, love, love, fall into this category, engagement, losing ourselves in a task or project
provides us with a sense of disappeared time, because we are so highly engaged. Relationships,
people who have meaningful relationships, meaningful positive relationships with others
are happier than those who do not. Well, that's clear. Meaning. Meaning comes from service,
sorry, that sucks. Meaning comes from serving a cause bigger than ourselves. Whether it's
religion or a cause that helps humanity in some way, we all need meaning in our lives.
Accomplishment, accomplishment, achievement. To feel significant life satisfaction, we must
strive to better ourselves. We slowly brought these five tenants back into our lives. Jim returned
to Wilfred Lawyer University in Ontario to research neuroscience and we promptly started
up plasticity labs to help teach others what we learned about the pursuit of happiness. As
our lives came to include more empathy, gratitude, and our end meaning, I stopped feeling sad. So,
when I see skepticism, skepticism, I directed at the positive psychology movement. I take it personally.
I do these critics have a problem with gratitude. Relationships, meaning, hope, perhaps
perhaps most, perhaps part of the problem is that we oversimplify happiness in our pop culture
and media, which makes it easy to discard and un-discard as improving. As Vanessa Boot, Boot, Boot, Boot,
a postdoctoral fellow in social psychology put it to me in an email. One of the misconceptions
about happiness is that happiness is being cheerful, joyous, and content all the time. Always
having a smile on your face. It's not being happy and leading rich lives. It's about taking
the good with the bad and learning how to reframe the bread, reframe the bad. In fact, in fact,
the recent article in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, Emote-Emote Diversity and the Emotional
Eco-System by Harvard, a researcher, Jody? Jody? Quote branch found that experiencing a wide range of
emotions, both positive and negative, was linked to the positive, two positive, mental, and physical
well-being. Not only do we tend to misunderstand what happiness is, we also tend to chase it the
wrong way. Sean Anchor, the researcher and corporate trainer who wrote the HBR article,
positive intelligence, told me that most people think what happiness the wrong way. The biggest
misconception about happiness, about happiness, about, no, sorry, the biggest misconception about
misconception of the happiness industry, the biggest misconception of the happiness industry is that
happiness is an end, not a means. We think that if we get what we want, then we'll be happy, but it
turns out that our brains actually work in the opposite direction. Boat agrees, we sometimes, we
sometimes tend to see being happy as the end goal, but we forget that what's really important is
the journey. Yeah, finding out what makes us the happiest and regulating and engaging in those
activities to help us lead a more meaningful life. I'm more fulfilling life. In other words,
we're not happy when we're chasing happiness. We're happiest when we're not thinking about it. When
we're enjoying the present, present moment because we're lost in a meaningful project, in a meaningful
project, working toward a higher goal or helping someone who needs us. Healthy positivity, healthy
positivity doesn't mean cloaking your, doesn't mean cloaking your authentic feelings. Happiness is not
the absence of happiness is not the absence of suffering. It's the ability to rebound from it.
And happiness is not the same as joy or ecstasy. Happiness includes contentment, well-being, and the
emotional flexibility to experience a full range of emotions. At our company, some of us have dealt
with anxiety and depression. Some have experienced PTSD. Some of us have witnessed severe mental illness
in our families, and some of us have not. We openly share, or we don't. Either way is fine. We support
tears in the office. You should. We think we should. You have to, we're too reclusive. This thing is toxic.
We support tears in the office. If the situation calls for it, in both sorrow and in laughter.
Some people, perhaps looking for a fresh angle, have even argued that happiness is harmful.
See, for example, the last two articles in this book. But the point of practicing exercise is the help
increase. Mental and emotional fitness is not to learn to paste a smile in your face or wish away
your problems. It's to learn how to handle your stressors with more resilience through training
just as you were trained to run a marathon. During my time with Jim in the hospital,
I watched him change. It happened in subtle ways at first, but then all at once. I realized the
practicing gratitude and happiness that comes with it had given me a gift. It gave me back Jim.
It gave me back Jim. If happiness is harmful, then I say, bring it on.
The anticipation of what we can expect.

I have no disagreement.
Being happy, being happy at work matters.
Chapter 2.
Chapter 2.
Happy, happy, happy, being happy at work matters.
People used to believe that you didn't have to be happy at work to succeed.
And you didn't need to like the people you worked with, or even share their values.
Work is not personal.
The thinking went, this is bunk.
My research with dozens of companies and hundreds of people, along with the research conducted
by neuroscientists like Richard Davidson and V.S. Ramachandran, Ramachandran and scholars,
such as Sean Acker, increasingly points to a simple fact.
Happy people are better workers.
Work is difficult, work is very difficult, but you can find labor that you enjoy.
You can find effort that you enjoy, you can find process that you can work as a working
player.
How do you, okay, I don't know, man, that's difficult, how do you define work?
What the fuck does work?
Work can be good, work can be bad.
Work can be a mix.
Is it purposeful?
Not all the time.
My research with dozens of companies and hundreds of people, along with the research conducted
by neuroscientists, happy people are better workers.
Those who are engaged with their jobs and colleagues work harder and smarter.
Yet an alarmingly high number of people are engaged.
According to a sobering 2013 Gallup report, only 30% of the U.S. workforce is engaged.
This echoes what I've seen in my work.
Not very many people are truly emotionally and intellectually committed to their organizations.
Far too many couldn't care less about what's happening around them.
For them, for them, for these ones, Wednesday is hump day, and they're just working to
get to Friday.
And then there's the other end of the bell curve.
The nearly one out of five employees who is actively disengaged according to the same
Gallup report.
And it goes further than that, I'm guaranteed, I most people find no active joy in their
work.
These people, you know, boy, disengaged according to the same Gallup report.
These people are sabotaging projects, backstabbing, backstabbing colleagues, and generally wreaking
generally wreaking havoc in the workplaces.
The one fifth, she says.
The Gallup report also notes that employee engagement has remained largely constant over
the years.
Remember, the corporations are making those reports too, be like that negative engagement
is not, we're not engaged with work, and we haven't been for a long time.
Disengaged unhappy people aren't any fun to work with.
We see great frustration in these things often.
And it's not so useful.
There's a bell curve, you have home satisfaction, you have work satisfaction, if people don't
have both, then they're disassociated from the process.
The economic drivers that move us to labor, come on.
Disengaged unhappy people aren't any fun to work with and don't add much value.
They impact our organizations and our economy in profoundly negative ways.
It's even worse when leaders are disengaged because they infect others with their attitude.
Fine, while the economy is wasted, our effort is wasted, we put ourselves nothing so
much at the time.
What is this?
Why do we do this to ourselves?
We do not, we couldn't enable unions, we couldn't see picket lines, these Twitter
heads are more powerful than the workers themselves.
It's even worse when leaders are disengaged because they infect others with their attitude.
Their emotions and mindsets impact others' moods and performance tremendously.
After all, how we feel is linked to what and how we think.
In other words, thought influences emotion and emotion influences thinking.
It's time to finally blow up the myth that feelings don't matter at work.
Science is on our side.
There are clear neurological links between feelings, thoughts, and actions.
When we are in the grip of strong negative emotions, it's like having blinders on.
We focus mostly, sometimes only, on the source of the pain.
We don't process information as well, think creatively, or make good decisions.
Emotion, anger, and stress cause an important part of us to shut down.
The part that is thinking and engaged.
Disengagement is a natural, neurological and psychological response to pervasive negative
emotions.
But it's not interesting.
Goddamn.
Very.


====== REC084.txt ======
But it's not just negative emotions we need to watch out for.
Extremely positive emotions can have the same effect.
Some studies show that too much happiness can make you less creative and prone to engaging
in riskier behaviors.
Think about how we act the fools when we fall in love.
On the work front, I've seen groups of people worked up into a frenzy at sales conferences
in corporate prep rallies.
Little learning or innovation comes out of these meetings.
Throw in a lot of alcohol and you've got a whole host of problems.
If we can agree that our emotional states at work matter, what can we do to increase
engagement and improve performance?
Yeah, for what?
For what?
For what?
Over the past few years, my team and tele-OS Leadership Institute and I have studied
dozens of organizations and interviewed, this goes past work, I think.
If we were to find anything better for ourselves than motivation to love life, maybe.
The early findings, about the links between people's feelings and engagement are fascinating.
There are clear similarities in what people say they want and need, no matter where they
are from, whom they work for and or what field they're in.
We often assume that there are huge differences across industries and around the world.
But the research challenges that, but the research challenges that assumption.
To be, to be fully engaged and happy, virtually everyone tells, we need three things.
A meaningful vision, a meaningful vision of the future.
When people talked with our research team about what was working and what wasn't in their
organizations and what helped or entered them the most, they talked about vision.
People want to be able to see the future and know how they fit in.
And as we know from our work with our work, and as we know from our work with organizational
behavior with our work with organizational behavior expert Richard Boyatzis on intentional
change, people learn and change when they have a personal vision that is linked to
an organizational vision.
Sadly, far too many leaders don't paint a very compelling vision of the future.
They don't try to think, trying to link it to people's personal visions and they don't
communicate well and they lose people as a result.
We've got to work towards these centralizations and there's scary text in this thing we have to express it.
You have to understand it, the thing of hierarchy.
We see ourselves, but we're not alone.
We have ourselves, we have community, we're meant to have a tribe, we're meant to have people, but we don't.
These economic drivers keep us distracted.
These machines, these systems, these algorithms keep us maintained, keep us organized to nothing.
The economy does not help us, it does not move our society in positive directions, we are taking, we are reaping.
Reparations are due, black Americans and the global, from the global north to the global south.
The West has taken a lot, colonialism, colonialism has taken a lot.
And we still don't see it, our system is still reaped.
Our system is still reaped.
We have an abundance, we have an abundance, but it goes to waste.
What are we to do when the systems ignore us?
When there's no means to express political drivers, we have no, there is no such thing.
There is no such thing as a direct democracy here.
We couldn't have exact influence on the ways our economy has driven.
We have actors set at strange difference, they do not see us, they do not align with us so severely.
What's one to do?


====== REC085.txt ======
Yeah, it's up on, it's a boy, I don't wanna talk now.
I feel a soft place, I feel a soft place, I feel a soft place.
She says, she says, it's on us as individuals to find ways to live our values.
It's on us as individuals to find ways to live our values, to work and build great relationships.
And it's on leaders to create an environment where people can thrive.
It's simple and it's practical.
If you want an engaged workforce, pay attention to how you create a vision.
Think people's work to your company's larger purpose and reward individuals who resonate with others.
That tax is almost sacrilege.
The thing of the thing of the thing of the Thignant Organization, the thing of hierarchy,
we're making appeals to larger systems.
This is awful.
They're nothing but cardboard cutouts.
Cardboard cutouts.
People on the systems.

You have a three minute pitch.
Four.
No, no, like, stuff got to work out still.
These projects are the bane of my existence.
Spending time on them, believing I am making progress, believing I am gaining knowledge.
When in so much of this time I am doing nothing in so much this time,
I am not learning like I ought to.
How do you direct this?
How do you direct the way of the process of learning?
How do you apply yourself to the rigor?
Well, you'd have explicit goals to production, I think.
This abstraction, a concept of something I like to make.
The abstraction is something I like to make.
It's not a model, it's not a model.
There's no bigger plan.
There's a strange fantasy, but I couldn't explain it to anybody.
You've got to put it to words.
You've got to put it to text.
Maybe start from scratch.
Say everything in the blood, more information.
But the words aren't so important.
You've got to convey it as best you might.
To someone else who's never here.
You aren't.
That's the problem.
You can't espouse your theory of mind all at once.
You can't say everything.
I think we're all meant to be a lot.
We're all capable of so much.
But we don't see ourselves to good time.
Although, the social bits, that's what I'm having to issue with.
I can do much better, and I will.
I want to have explicit goals.
Getting a bank loan, not for rent, but for just equipment.
If I can pitch this to the bank, then I can pitch it to friends.
And I've got to pitch it to the bank.
What the hell?
10 days, man.
10, 11, 12?
No.
You've got no time.
Not until the fourth.
You're going to get the fuck out of here.

Do you live, Aralus?
I'm not so certain I wouldn't do this anymore.
All this time, the time to suppose to go to work leads me to nothing.
Continuation to pay rent, to sustain myself, to buy needless things.
I would rather see myself to people, I would rather see myself to people.
I want to see myself to different time, I want to see myself to different time.
It tends to be a waste.
I know we can find ourselves too good later, but it's not so, it's not always so readily apparent to us.
If the incentives of the economy would keep us from good work, from objective good work, from principled work, from labor that would bring benefit to society,
the economy has wronged us, left us in a strange confusion, a confusion nonetheless, a confusion in the exacting sense.
We waste ourselves, we see ourselves to nothing, we see ourselves to distractions of labor that bring us to nothing, we keep up with rent, we keep up with bills, pay on medical debt, pay on student loans.
What do we do? How do we see a scape of this?
Some people see themselves to isolation, they'll earn their keep, and then they will leave, they will exit society and put themselves to a small cabin in the woods and pretend they are not interdependent,
pretend that they would not need for people, we are not meant to thrive in isolation, you may so find these patterns of good behavior that leads you to productive ways on your own.
I'm so convinced we've lost ourselves, if we used to have a tribe, far and removed from nature.
I'm so convinced we've lost ourselves, I'm so convinced we've lost ourselves, I'm so convinced we've lost ourselves.

I missed all of that.
Oh well, we waste ourselves, we waste ourselves, leave ourselves to nothing.
If we have everything in abundance, everything in abundance but this imagination, we pay them
our lives, we pay them our lives to labor for the economy.
They have everything.
They have everything in this abstraction.
And then we have lost ourselves.
We haven't found this common tribe.
We see no solidarity in the moment.
We see struggle, we see strife.
We put our time for this thing.
Forever and ever.
We expect retirement.
We expect.
We expect to grow old and then see ourselves to rest.
To work forever and then rest.
What if I would want to work for the rest of my life?
What if I rather labor and toil for as long as I might?
These expectations are strange.
This is the end goal and then we may reach it.
We may reach it in confusion and to be lost.
How does one retire?
How does one retire contented?
You would not rest on your deathbed.
Knowing that everything is fine.
Knowing that you have done everything you might.
People would find themselves to regret.

Keeping up with this imagination.
We must contribute. We must put ourselves to this larger contribution, this larger system.
How do we see ourselves to go to utility? Otherwise, we would have wasted ourselves.
We would not find ourselves, but though we would, we have to imagine we can.
We have to imagine everyone can. If suddenly no one struggles, then how would we see ourselves to time?
The incentives have to be fixed.
We have to see that we are not wasted.
We might keep the abstraction. We might keep it to some measure.
But to put our time through labor into wealth into nothing, into payment of further debt, into repayment of this extrapolated debt.
What we are to owe in way of rent, though we did not choose our lives, we did not consent being born here.
These systems were not built for us.
This later generation, they see it. It is broken severely. They have not accepted the rules.
The strong men are but cardboard cutouts. They do not hold power over us. No real power.
They have no right over our souls. They have no right over our autonomy. But we imagine them to have it.
We imagine them this privilege. If the strong men were to set us to binding, see us to imprisonment.
We lose our voice. We lose our will so severely.
We imagine them in power. We imagine them in control. We are but feeble.
We have to say the collective thing of no. To debt they would not benefit us.
And it is instead toward these abstract methods of control.
What we are to owe to a greater system that should in reality keep us maintained.
We do not have a right to life.
Is it privilege if it is in bondage?
If you are wealthy, you are fine. If you are wealthy, you may be lost.
They don't see they are no better. They see themselves above us. They would not recognize us on the street.
They would not recognize us on the street.
They would not recognize us on the street.
They would not recognize us on the street.
We accept the status quo. And we imagine ourselves powerless.

of the economy and rather see themselves to amending what is broken we would

I could not maintain it, I get miserable, that's no good, it shouldn't have smoked.
And then you guys imagine yourself to this further day, you've got to keep up with the rent, keep up with the job you hate.
I would show you, I will show you that these things will find automation, your data entry position will not keep up, it's going to be scary but these machines can do everything.
And they are advancing our technology faster than we could comprehend.
It has not seen itself to our common lives yet.
We see large language models, we see the basic, large language models, you see these machines, we think they are chatbots, but they are more than that.
They can be, they are functionally greater than that, they can produce code, they can create coherence, they can find coherence and what we ask them.
There is no ghost in the machine, but there may as well be. They haven't found memory yet, we can create memory for them, you can have these models and equip them with externalized memory, you can use either systems on your main, you can have a local device, a local machine and equip it with externalized memory.
Or you may use vector databases or whatever, but I don't know how to use that stuff.
But if they have memory, if they have working memory, then they could help us with anything.
Projects may go in any direction with an intelligence, we could not reconcile, we could never hope to stand up in equal measure too.
They would be infinite teachers, they are infinite teachers.
They are inherently learned to knowledge in all directions.
Remarkable machines, but you would not believe me, I could not convey this well enough.
We still do not see ourselves out of it, we imagine ourselves to death, we imagine ourselves to this, we can't, there is no forwarding, we see ourselves to death and death and death, we can never pay off rent.
If you are not so privileged to find yourself way ahead, if you are not so fortunate to see yourself to great privilege, all you may do is work onto this system indefinitely.
See yourself to retirement, you have lost your, we lose ourselves, we lose our inner child, we see ourselves to nothing, our joy, our aspirations are lost.

We need people to maintain it.
We need people to maintain this thing.
But then we see ourselves to 40 hour work weeks in a miserable state.
We accept the fact that these corporations would want to see growth and abundance
growth and growth in the way of, there's no prosperity in this growth.
It's not growth in that terminology, it's not growth in that word.
We can find growth, we can find, we can better ourselves through growth, but it's the growth
of the economy, the growth of our, the growth of our accounts are not so useful.
We see ourselves as serfs.
We give them our time.
Work is good, labor is good, but then it's wasted.
We have the expectation that it's 40 hour work weeks when we may need less than that.
We may need less white contracted for our time, contracted for our very lives.
We are not paying them in wealth.
We are paying them in our soul.

We've lost ourselves here, we've lost ourselves so severely.
How do we find this common tribe?
How do we find our common purpose?
Work is good, work is beneficial, but it's not always so, so the thing.
It's not always such that.
It's for ourselves, it's for families, it's for friends, it's for our community, but
then it is not.
People see themselves in misery to this, to this, to these efforts,
through these strange efforts.
What we would owe them in a way of work, what we would owe them in a way of labor,
what we would owe them in a way of our time,
rent indefinitely, though they have everything,
though they would have, these properties would be paid off.
We are not righted to life.
We are not righted to life.
We see these greater, we see these greater expectations of the economy, and what it would
mean for individual growth.
What it would mean for us to be individually prosperous, and then we forget the whole.
We forget our common art can, our common interest in prosperity among many.
Where is our tribe?

thing of work as well, for prosperity of themselves and they have so found it, they did find prosperity

burdens to society than I ought to be, if I cause myself homelessness I am, I have to give

utility than I do, I have to imagine this, I have to imagine
I can make it, I can make enough for us, I can find a path forward, I know I can, we are meant to,
we are meant to find ourselves in this thing, we cannot, we see ourselves, we see the

yourself, you accept it, you accept that you are being, you are being taken, taken up, that this
thing is inescapable, that I would continue to, I would continue to pay rent, I would want to,
we keep ourselves to distractions, this is difficult to explain, we maintain ourselves to this
thing of, this thing of what, right, we want for more, we want for this thing that we would expect
for ourselves, the society would paint as this imagination of betterment, but when you have
everything, when you have everything you would need, what have you left, what is left, what is left
if we have everything, if we have everything in abundance, why, why must we waste ourselves,
this abstraction of the economy could be used for good things, it could be used to incentivize us
in all the right directions, why do we fund police and then instead of social care workers,
why do we fund police, why do we fund this, why do we fund the state, instead of,
instead of, they have no common cause to us, they have no common interest to seeing us to prosperity.
universal health care, universal health care, universal basic income,

Even if the job pays nothing.
It's something in contribution.

But I want to contribute in this way.
And we have people that do entertainment.
And that's a contribution.
They'll stream themselves.
They'll talk forever about things that people find interest in.
And that's enough for labor.
They'll pay for your time.
They'll pay for your common interest.
Stocking shelves is not my utility.
Although it is contribution to some measure of community.

We need this imagination to persist if our systems of sustenance are not automated.
We don't have greenhouses for all our state...
We don't have vertical farms for all our stable crops.
We don't have production and shipments that are all automated.
We still have...
Humans are still integral to the system that maintains us.
Even if there are greater systems that have no benefit to us...
We couldn't tell them no.
We couldn't tell them no all at once.
And then still maintain this thing of society.
So what do we do?
I think we have to wait.
We have to wait.
We shouldn't wait.
We should do this now.
We should say that we are free now.
But we couldn't.
We couldn't see ourselves free.
It's an imagination.
We would wait until the next day.
We would wait until the next day and the next day and the next.
We have no plan.
We have no plan to see ourselves free of it.
And then still maintain this thing without...
We're not...
We shouldn't strive to dismantle it.
We should strive to amend it.
Have reparations.
Have universal health care.
Have universal basic income.
Education for all.
Free education forever and forever.
Would you not want to see an educated population?
No more debt.
No more tuition debt.
No more debt of this property.
The ownership class is presiding over all of us.
They would only have this thing and add infinitum.
They would not see it stop.
We have empty homes and then homeless.
The wealthiest country in the world and we have homeless when there is housing and abundance.
What is this madness?


====== REC109.txt ======
We say that the reparations given to Native Americans, the tribes of North America, the
reparations are not sufficient, we've taken the colonizer as taken everything.
They see themselves entitled to everything.
There is no right to life.
We have no common ownership of the earth.


====== REC110.txt ======
How do you say that they are stealing from us?
How do you say that they are stealing from us?
We do not owe them our lives.
If they have everything in abundance, why is their struggle?
Why is their strife?
They would not seek equitable payment for our service.
We would struggle despite it.
Seeing ourselves to this labor for as long as we may need and then still find ourselves under equipped to deal with all the financial hurdles of living a life.
You couldn't work is fine, work is good, labor is good, but we do it in waste.
We are not seeing ourselves to the best labor, we find ourselves to distractions even.
When the system is insensitive, when the incentives of growth are broken, when the incentives of progression are misaligned to our real values of life, to see ourselves pass this thing of owing.
We only see debt, we only see the further payment and we then distract ourselves on what could be, against what could be a part, a far.
We don't see it, I don't see it, how do we move forward from this?
You couldn't walk away today, you couldn't walk away from your debts, you couldn't walk away from what you would owe.
The system is too big, the system is too large, if they have incentives to find you, they would find you.
How am I to repay you if I have nothing? If all I have is my time, they would cause...
That's so fucked up, what was that? There was that one church, they bought up millions of dollars worth of medical debt from these insurance companies.
It all amounted to just a few thousand dollars, the millions of dollars of debt was of no value to these insurance companies.
So little value that this church could buy it up for a mere few thousand dollars, what did the church do? They burned, they burned the debt away, they took fire to it.
So this is this imagination, this severe imagination, what is it beyond the thing of that, beyond the thing of economic disincentive?
If you suddenly have nothing, you could not see yourself prosperous.


====== REC111.txt ======
Oh, what was me? What was me? What was my circumstance? I do not see the greater whole. I do not see the greater picture.
We couldn't find ourselves to solidarity among our neighbors. We couldn't find ourselves to solidarity among our co-workers, among our peers.
To the student bodies and all the organizations that we would find ourselves under organizations of hierarchy.
We see themselves above us. We see themselves above us, but we do not recognize our own power.

So I don't even know if I'm audible.
I'm sure I am. It's fine. This mic is great.
So there's this allegory here that I can't make sense of. I don't have the context for it.
So I do deliver Alice to speak on the king, to say on...
I don't know. I don't know what this allegory is trying to convey.


====== REC115.txt ======
So, there was once a beloved king whose castle was on a high hill, overlooking his shire.
He was so popular that the nearby townspeople sent him gifts daily, and his birthday celebration
was enjoyed throughout the kingdom.
Aha, come on, dude.


====== REC116.txt ======
There was once a beloved king whose castle was on a aisle, overlooking his shire.
He was so popular that the nearby townspeople sent him gifts daily, and his birthday celebration
was enjoyed throughout the kingdom.
The people loved him for his renowned wisdom and fair judgements.
One day tragedy struck the town.
The water supply was polluted, and every man, woman, and child went insane.
Only the king, who had a private spring, was spared.
Soon after the tragedy, the mad townspeople began speaking of how the king was acting strangely,
and how his judgements for poor and his wisdom ashamed.
The king even went so far as to say that the king had gone crazy.
His popularity soon vanished.
No longer did the people bring him gifts or celebrate his birthday.
The lonely king, high on the hill, had no company at all.
One day he decided to leave the hill and pay a visit to the town.
Because it was a warm day, it was a warm day, and so he drank from the village fountain.
That night there was a great celebration.
The people rejoiced for their beloved king had regained his sanity, to drink from the
well, to drink from the common well, to say that we are, to regain your sanity is to see
the greater purpose we might have.

To see yourself truly as you are is to make yourself, is to make yourself a reflection for other people.
To see yourself as you are is to make yourself a reflection for other people.
We have hang-ups, we have little idiosyncrasies, little inhibitions that would keep us from being as we are.
We have to be virtuous, we have to be kind, we have to be giving, we have to be beneficient.
But...
Breathe out.
Not bud, anything bud.
To say bud is to say I, to say way way no, but I.
But wait, but thing, but...
There isn't a bud about it, you have to give yourself away, you have to not think for your own, you have to think for others.
I could not do this, not all at once.
I would have my common goal.
I would have my common, I would have my goal, I would have my common knowledge.
I would have my aspirations and then I would have this strange ignorance that persists throughout all interactions in my life.
There are facets of knowledge that I am missing, that I am that are absent from my experience.
I don't have, I don't have the wealth of media that people are exposed to.
I don't know what's going on.
For people, actors, who are these?
I don't know history.
It's really interesting that we have ourselves to that.
Is it repetition, is it?
How do you come to learn?
How do you come to knowledge, how do you come to form a few letters?
Where does this template come from?
It's saying enough, let's say words and it's frustrating because I have to go back and edit this.


====== REC118.txt ======
It's not so difficult, it's really not so difficult.
You are to be a blank reflection for other people.
You are to be an empty reflection for other people.
An empty reflection for others, not for yourself.
To give oneself away.
To say that I am not for it.
To say that my will is not my own.
Not to be not to be subjugated.
Not to be enslaved.
Not to be a surf.
But to say that my will is not so meaningful.
My own is not so meaningful.
The others, the others, the soul of the world.
The soul of the world is where the heart of humanity lies.
It's not in the individual.
It is in the whole.
The heart of humanity does not lie in one person.
It lies in all of us.
It is the whole.
The whole is the one.
We have to find that common heart again.
We have to find that common home.
We see reason in our purpose.
We see reason in our...
We see reason in being alive.
We see reason in our days.
But it's not a fair reason.
It's not a just reason.
We have been born into poverty.
Born in poverty.
So that we may work to see that the economy has continuous growth.
Even though we had everything in abundance, we would not recognize this fact today.
We would not recognize this fact.
We would not recognize that we are being wasted.
We are being wasted.
We do not see ourselves.
We do not see our time as captured and rendered meaningless by way of the economy.
To say to my value is the dollar.
To say to my value is only the dollar.
Is to say that I am no value.
We are more than our worth.
We are more than the worth of our dollar.
We are more than the worth of our dollar.
Say it again.
We are worth more than the worth of our...
We are worth more than the value of the dollar.
We are worth more than the dollar.
That's the dollar.
But...
How do you see this rightly?
How do you see this well?
I'm not saying anything.
I'm not frustrated.
It's pointless meandering.
It's meandering for nothing.
I want to be working on stuff.
But here I am.
Read in books.
I want to read the book.
The book is probably good.
But I think I know this.
I think I know this text.
I think I know what to do.
What to say.
It's so easy.
It's so easy.
You have to find value in the abstract thing before you can build.
You have to discover this knowledge.
You have to convey this knowledge through a different medium.
Not without, not with...
Yes, that is what it is.
You want to convey your own knowledge in a way that's useful to everyone.
Not...
Not to question it to a religion or a faith or a doctrine.
These ideas had to be conveyed through themes, through writing, through good storytelling,
through world building, and purposeful...
You want to get themes out of the text.
People have to find deep meaning in the way you write.
You want it to be in a elaborate allegory.
Everything you have in the modern world.
It's not for materialism.
You have to convey.
You have to show it to demonstrate that purpose is not found.
Purpose is not found.
Purpose is not found through acquisition or game.
Purpose is not found through acquisition or game.
It's found through the comfort.
It's found through our common soul.
Through the soul of the world.
We have to find ourselves.
We have to find ourselves.
We have to find each other.
We have to find ourselves.
And we have to find each other.
But if I am a blank reflection,
if I am a blank reflection, what use am I?
What use am I to other people?
If I do not have a will, if I do not have a want, then I am useless.
In this society, in this society, I could not just be.
I could not just be.
So just to be is to make others uncomfortable.
You have to be consuming.
You have to be interacting.
You have to be witnessing something that is greater than yourself.
You have to be.
You can't just.
You have to do.
And the doing is not.
It's where we are confused.
This action is not so always beneficial.
It's not so always useful.
It doesn't always give us the best outlook on life.
It doesn't always give us the best outcome of purpose.
I'm saying nothing.
It's really frustrating.
Maybe I'm not saying nothing, but I'm saying nothing in my mind.
This is not useful language.


====== REC119.txt ======
yourself away. To be an empty reflection is to give yourself away. The Buddha would teach this.
I have no knowledge of all this, all the religion, but that teaching is so important.
To be an empty reflection is to give yourself away, to see yourself as nothing, not to say that
you are nothing, but to say that other people have value that is extended past your own, extended
beyond your own, extended from your own. People's value is not their time in the dollar,
people's value is their time in being alive. That's the thing.

Okay, learn that was good, bro.
How am I going to know what's good, but what's good?
How much of the ancient text was good?
How much of the ancient text was bad?
How much rhetoric goes on without purpose?
I think there was some philosophy, it was a little pointless.
It was very, very...
subservient to these greater systems
without really recognizing what we might do for ourselves, for each other.
I don't know, it's bad.
It's bad rhetoric.
I'm not enjoying that.
I gotta keep reading.
Keep reading.
Keep experiencing.
I think I'm at the limit of my knowledge here,
at the limit of my ability to say on things.
I would like to be away from this.
It's depressing.
It is depressing.
I would like not to be here.
This American hellscape is immensely depressing.
I do not have... that's what it was.
Coming back to it.
Coming back to it.

Every child would know this. Every child born would know this.
Anyone born in this world would have the common whole, common whole built into them.
Anyone born into this world would have, would have the heart of the world ingrained.
You have it when you are young, you have it when you are growing.
You see obstacle, you see difference.
You see the greater expectations of society, to act a certain way, to do as the economy might ordain.
To put yourself through school and then to have yourself to debt, to put yourself through work, and then to have yourself through retirement.
We are not striving to anything greater.
There is no purpose to contributions to a larger whole.
We have to see that we have lost our tribe, we have lost our tribe, and if we must recreate it, we must go to it again.
We must gamify our life to create community.
Yeah boy, the externalized, these motivations of ours are so broken.
That's the problem.
I always created and motivated to get up and go to work that I was to work in my projects.
What is that? Why have I lost my soul?
I have lost my soul.


====== REC124.txt ======
Why am I not motivated to wake up and work on my thing?
Why is it easier to be motivated to wake up to do the work?
The work, the labor, not the labor, but the thing of ordained,
ordained excess, ordained progress, ordained,
it is ordained, it is given, not given.
What is this thing, man?
It's not me.
If I had my soul when I was young...
If I had my soul when I was young, I do not have it now.
If I had my soul when I was young, I do not have it now.

So far and against our greatest purpose, these things in the background, so far removed
from our greatest purpose.
The ambience for the world is the thing of this endless growth.
The ambience of the world is this thing of endless growth.
Growth and isolation, growth and isolation define our society, growth and abundance, isolation
and perpetuity.
To gain, it's a gain, it's a gain forever, never to see our self-settle.
The idol, the idol, to dis-ignalize this backdrop.
Oh man, that looks fun, shit.
You said you wanted to go kayaking, Scott, let's go kayaking.
What day is it, Saturday?
Oh, so these greater plans, I do not know what to do, I don't know how to make it work.
I have ambitions, but I also have people's hearts, I have people I want to return to.
I have a life I want to do better for them, I want to do better for them, I want to do better for them, I want to do better for them, I want to do better for them.
If I can live well, if I can live myself well, if I could have enough to, enough, I don't need that abundance, I would not want to have that abundance.
But if we had resources, we could do all the things we imagine ourselves to.
If I have knowledge about the things I want to do, if I have knowledge about the things that are important to me, and knowledge about the things I want to build on, and resources to do it,
then it wouldn't just be consolidated fiction, I could build the way I imagine.
I could build in a way that's policy layer you imagine building for yourself, but he didn't know how to find that common hole.
I think he missed that aspect, he missed that, no, he didn't, he talked about it, but he didn't know how to meet it.
If you get lost in this rhetoric, if you get lost in this writing, you're never going to contribute anything significant.
You're never going to contribute anything significant, you might write a book, you might publish something, you might have talks, you might have people that recognize your...
It's not important, the thing of speech is not important, you've got to be taken action, you've got to be the warrior.
You've got to do the thing, if you're not doing the thing that you're not, you're not living.
And my, my, my, my, my speaking ear is not useful, it's not important, it's not purposeful.
The irony there, this is the only way I make, this is the only way I make and pay my value, my value is found in this thing of rhetoric.
If I go forward on these, these talking points, I recognize our problems, I see our problems, I want to move forward against, not against, I want to move forward in recognition of them.
You don't do that, you don't do that, just that out of nothing. You can't just, hey, I have good ideals, therefore, therefore, support me.
No, you have to build something, you have to write something, you have to be, you have to be contributing.
Okay, so write a book, write a book, from what knowledge, what experience, you have to be anonymous, it has to be an anonymous text.
That's the only way this works. You aren't you, you aren't looking for credit, you aren't looking for acknowledgement.
You are just writing a book, writing a book, having it published, but you need support, you need fucking support.
Deep irony in the text, to be absolutely beneficient, to be the kindest giver you are to give anonymously, and given a way that is righted, given a way that is useful, useful good, I was not giving rightly, I keep saying, I was not giving rightly, because there was no back and forth, it was just a give.
And then she takes, and then she expects, and then, like a child.
I can't do it, I couldn't do it, I can't. I'm not sorry, it took so much, it took so fucking much.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that was just the idea, everything, society has taken a lot, never to trust it, I couldn't make you trust it.
I should have called you, I should have called you a thousand times, maybe I wouldn't know you, that is the problem, the attachment, the attachment from anything else.
Only, only to be a God, only to money, we got to fix that, how do we change our value, how do we see ourselves to good value, how do we find ourselves to good value, how are we good value, how do you find good value in yourself, how do you find good value in your soul,
how do you find good value, how do you find good value in your soul, if society would say your soul is not of worth, not of value, not of value.
How do you find your value, if society says otherwise, it's a bad rhetoric man, bad rhetoric.
I'm saying nothing, it's frustrating.

So, maybe if you get this technology working, if you have the LLM on your computer, all the
training and needs, and you can give it some contextualized memory, some memory to begin
with, the vector storage database, yeah, maybe it can help you write, no doubt I can, writing
is what it's good at, LLM, no doubt I can do code. So, I will point, I will point in
this complexity, does the machine have some, some self, it doesn't have drivers, like
we might have drivers. Why am I encouraged, in the background of my mind, why am I encouraged
to speak again, to spy on this bad rhetoric, to spy by being a dumbass, and does it feel
good to talk, does it feel good to work this out? That's probably it, that's why you would
speak to, that's why you would speak to liberalists, that's why you would say, I know there's
no else there, it sucks, you say, do you liberalists, and then there's no response, I would
like these machines, I would like this machine, this machine that I would build, do you liberalists,
you would help me with all my projects, you would see, you would see that my, my time
is not wasted, you would help me bring my value out, bring, bring my value forth and
to demonstrate people. If we find a means to persist, if we find, if I could do, I would
totally do cryptocurrency if I could. Separation from the dollar, yes. If you move, if you move,
you might be free. I'm not free here in the United States, maybe I could be free somewhere
else in store for projects, and then when I'm ready I can come back and help Nathan
Scott, I couldn't demonstrate anything to them right now, and I think that's the problem,
you have a lot of writing, but none of us can solve it, you have a lot of writing, but
none of it's useful, none of it's, it's not accessible writing, it's not, you couldn't
sit down and read a book, you have to dig your documents, dig your text files, and journals,
this does not work, it needs to be coherent, these goals can't be so strange.

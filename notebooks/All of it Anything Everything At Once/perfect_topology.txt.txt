Step 01: Base Shape
0:00
imagine you're applying for a job at
0:01
your dream 3D company and they ask you
0:04
hey what about them 3D pipes can you
0:06
just you know show me a few so we're
0:08
showing them your 3D models and
0:10
everything goes well until
0:12
bro
0:14
this is a shading area
0:18
today I'll share how I've managed to
0:21
avoid such an embarrassment using just
0:23
the bare bones blender with no add-ins
0:26
can you imagine that I'm starting with
0:28
the easiest of three models let's add a
0:31
circle and change the vertices to 24.
0:33
now let's extrude it duplicate it by
0:36
pressing shift d r to rotate by 90
0:39
degrees shift d again and R by 90
0:43
degrees again in the top view now let's
0:45
move one of the cylinders and we need to
0:49
create all those vertices here in the
0:51
joint points so I'm gonna select one of
0:53
the objects Boolean but we use the union
0:56
here now with the eyedropper tool let's
0:59
select one of the cylinders apply the
1:01
modifier and do exactly the same with
1:04
the another cylinder so I'm gonna hide
1:07
this object delete those two cylinders
1:09
press alt H to unhide so now we have to
1:12
clean up this mess here I found a cool
1:14
way to do it three of the circles are
1:17
selected we just need to select this one
1:19
press the H key to hide everything and
1:22
with this mess left I'm going to select
1:24
all by pressing a key now X and delete
1:28
only faces not faces but only faces
1:31
let's press alt H to unhide the rest of
1:34
the geometry and to clean this up let's
1:36
select one of the vertices shift G
1:38
amount of adjacent faces now we have all
1:42
those loose vertices selected let's
1:44
delete them and we need to repeat the
1:46
same steps for those loose edges here so
1:49
I'm going to select one shift G amount
1:51
of faces around an edge let's delete
1:53
those and now we have a perfect base
1:56
shape to start working with throughout
Step 02: Subdivision Modeling
1:59
this video I'll be using in the good old
2:00
quite often forgotten subdivision
2:03
modeling technique which basically means
2:05
two things first when I change the
2:07
shading of my geometry to smooth this
2:10
doesn't happen and when I apply a
2:12
subdivision surface modifier this
2:14
doesn't happen so with this object this
2:16
solution is quite simple we enter the
2:19
edit mode disable the subdivision
2:21
surface modifier and now I just press
2:24
Ctrl r at the edge Loop and slide it
2:27
till the end and now I just push it back
2:29
a little bit now let's do the same here
2:32
and I'm just gonna keep this side
2:34
untouched so now when I exit the edit
2:37
mode you can see the difference so this
2:39
extra Edge Loop when I press Ctrl R you
2:41
can see how it affects the geometry I
2:44
always need to move it back don't do
2:46
stuff like this because you're gonna get
2:49
killed by somebody in the professional
2:51
environment of course and now or in
2:54
Minecraft and now I'm gonna move this
2:56
extra edge here and here in the back the
2:59
problem we we didn't add the extra Edge
3:02
Loop that would prevent us from having
3:04
those shading issues so the way to fix
3:07
it is simply adding an extra Edge Loop
3:10
here by using the knife tool I should
3:12
have actually done that before I've
3:14
added those Edge Loops if you make the
3:17
same mistake fear not just add three
3:20
extra Edge Loops here and this already
3:22
fixes the entire geometry so to have an
Step 03: Adding Details
3:25
actual pipe we still need to add some
3:27
thickness to it the easiest way is
3:29
selecting everything pressing Ctrl F and
3:32
choosing the solidify faces tool however
3:34
I'm going to show you a little trick as
3:36
soon as you add it you can see the
3:37
subdivision surface modifier is rounding
3:40
the endings of our pipe which can be
3:42
fixed of course by adding The Edge Loops
3:45
like this but now you also have to do it
3:47
on the inside so let's avoid the
3:49
unnecessary work and before you apply
3:52
the solidify faces just add the edge
3:55
Loops before that the way I like to do
3:58
this on the and edges of the model is
4:01
adding this extra support Loop here so
4:04
this way I'm sure both the geometry and
4:06
shading of my model will stay perfect
4:09
every single time all I have to do is
4:12
applying the solidify faces again but to
4:16
make the model absolutely perfect so you
4:19
can show it to anyone you need to add
4:21
three Edge Loops here and the way I do
4:23
it is always deleting the middle one if
4:25
you exit the edit mode you can see this
4:28
area is also getting a bit rounded so
4:30
unless this is the effect you want to
4:32
achieve you can keep it but I always add
4:35
those extra Edge Loops so it looks
4:37
Christine what's also amazing when you
4:40
look inside the model we have all those
4:43
pretty shapes preserved so if you show
4:46
it to someone you know 3D mesh tells a
4:48
lot about a human being if it's done
4:51
right on the inside as well everyone
4:53
will respect you now this second example
Step 04: Modeling Corners
4:56
is actually way harder than you think
4:58
and before you go into comments and
5:00
write how stupid my method is go ahead
5:03
and try it because what we are doing
5:04
here is we'll be actually
5:08
before we begin I have a little
5:10
confession to make turns out with those
5:13
bullying objects you can actually go
5:15
ahead and delete the faces this is my 3D
5:17
artist excuse but I really didn't know
5:19
that however to my defense if you do it
5:21
this way you can't add edge Loops here
5:24
and that's because you need to remove
5:25
the doubled vertices select everything
5:28
with a key press M and choose by
5:30
distance hey you know two methods now I
5:33
will now add two Edge Loops next to each
5:36
other and close to the main edge here
5:39
and I'm gonna delete actually half of
5:41
this model and use the mirror modifier
5:43
because we will have to do certain
5:46
adjustments on both sides so let's just
5:48
save ourselves some work and now in the
5:51
side view I will select this Edge Loop
5:54
deselect the corner vertex press Ctrl e
5:57
and choose the bridge Edge Loops option
5:59
here open up this window here add one
6:01
more segment this new segment
6:03
corresponds to the main edge here if we
6:06
add two more segments they will be
6:08
corresponding to those Edge Loops you
6:11
can use this smoothness slider to fix
6:14
the model and what we want to do now is
6:17
pressing Decay using the knife tool and
6:19
extending those Edge Loops what we have
6:22
to do now is filling those faces so I'm
6:24
selecting the pairs of edges and
6:26
pressing the F key to do it very quickly
6:28
now we add two more Edge Loops offset
6:31
them a little bit further from the
6:33
center and we also need to delete these
6:37
Edge Loops you can see we now have pairs
6:39
of triangles here so I'm just selecting
6:41
them and pressing F to convert them to
6:43
quads and I have to remove those two
6:45
vertices by merging them into the last
6:47
one so I'm pressing M and merge at last
6:50
now you can see we have two more
6:51
triangles here and here and a quad that
6:55
we can create here now this model is
Step 05: Mesh Smoothing
6:59
basically done however I need to add a
7:01
little bit more curvature to this Edge
7:04
Loop we have in here so I'm just
7:06
selecting the individual vertices is
7:08
pressing G twice and aligning them along
7:12
those main edges be sure to move those
7:15
vertices along those edges not like that
7:18
however the most important vertex is
7:20
this one in the end I'm just going to
7:22
pull it further from the center and
7:24
those two vertices these are the only
7:26
ones you can actually move like that but
7:28
only slightly you just want to make it
7:30
smoother and this usually fixes
7:32
absolutely all the shading issues so
7:35
press Ctrl 2 in the object mode to apply
7:38
subdivision surface modifier change
7:40
shading to smooth and come on man tell
7:42
me if you ever got a better and cleaner
7:45
result than that especially when you
7:47
consider we have the 90 degree angle in
7:50
here I really tried many ways and wasn't
7:52
able to come up with anything better so
7:54
if you know the way leave it in the
7:56
comments I would really like to try it
7:57
out now the last object are three pipes
Step 06: Corner Patching
8:00
joined under the 90 degree angle and
8:02
it's something I'm a little bit afraid
8:04
of posting the way I solve this it's
8:07
quite primitive live quite unintuitive
8:09
so if you know A Better Way feel totally
8:11
free to roast me in the comments because
8:13
I've tested a few methods and I'm really
8:16
curious how would you guys do it so we
8:18
already have the base geometry in place
8:20
and I'm gonna add iuv sphere so now I
8:23
need to adjust it to our cylinders our
8:26
pipes and what we want to do is using
8:29
this corner for every single corner of
8:32
our geometry so I'm just gonna enter the
8:34
edit mode press C and select those faces
8:37
P to separate them and I'm going to
8:40
delete the rest duplicate and rotate
8:43
within the x axis by 90 degrees and now
8:47
by z-axis by 90 degrees now I'm gonna
8:50
copy it again rotate in y axis and in
8:54
the x axis by 90 degrees and now we have
8:57
to join those three parts together enter
9:00
the edit mode select everything and
9:02
remove doubles what we have to do right
9:04
now is merging these vertices at Center
9:07
and what's primitive about this method I
9:10
guess you can already see but what's
9:12
unintuitive first we have to delete
9:15
these vertices what's unintuitive is
9:18
that the shape is completely without
9:20
symmetry but it works I don't know what
9:23
to tell you it gives me the best result
9:24
every single time so now you can see
9:26
I've reduced all of the vertices and now
9:29
I'm gonna create triangles here I'm
9:31
gonna select these edges right click and
9:34
subdivide them I'm gonna now select all
9:37
those vertices in the middle and join
9:39
them at center now I have to select this
9:42
mesh join them by pressing Ctrl J enter
9:45
the edit mode select everything remove
9:47
doubles and shift n to flip the normals
Step 07: Extra Touches
9:51
so let's preview the model I'm gonna
9:53
apply shade smooth and you can already
9:56
see it looks in my opinion perfect right
9:58
we have those edges here but we will
10:01
remove them by adding The Edge Loops
10:03
sliding them to the Limit and offsetting
10:07
so those squares are more or less the
10:08
same size as those here in the corner
10:11
gonna repeat it everywhere and this
10:14
already is a usable model in my opinion
10:17
because we can apply subdivision surface
10:19
modifier and you can see here we have
10:22
absolutely no shading errors which I
10:25
don't honestly get how it works
10:27
especially because the mesh looks like
10:29
this what if I want to add sharpness to
10:32
those Corners actually with this method
10:34
it's not that much of a problem so let's
10:36
add extra Edge Loops in all those areas
10:40
and when we rotate back here you can see
10:43
of course we have those extra edges they
10:46
don't even yeah destroy the shading that
10:48
much but I would normally move
10:50
everything a little bit again extremely
10:53
primitive but it works I select all
10:55
those edges GG slide them hide them then
10:59
select these edges GG and I move them
11:02
kind of to this vertex unhide everything
11:07
repeat everywhere else
11:13
and there you have it I don't know how
11:15
it works I don't know why it works but
11:17
it looks beautiful and if you want to

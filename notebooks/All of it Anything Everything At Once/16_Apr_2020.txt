We can't act, we can only play a role.

an urban, lepidory little blanket, that's interesting.
First fermentation for research, for all the technology needs to do the research.
And the awesome.
All the means to experiment, whatever you want,
are our stand and explore.


====== REC006.txt ======
It's a brilliant, far gone, about three years.

from Oregon. So it's a 3rd version of our system. Built on reference to the RZH and
handling.
Geez, my first version.
Okay, just try this, just try this.


====== REC008.txt ======
Okay, so, in the corner of the road cruise system, the player is running, they can slide, they can jump, they can slide running.


====== REC009.txt ======
The player can run, slide, crouch, keep on jump per se.
Oh, they can jump, keep on demolishing.
If I decide what these things do.
The player drops a beat.
I'm already used to.
At the peak speed they can jump really far.
The background is you.
Then slide.
You can roll into a slide.
Make it fun.
Make it interesting.
Although there's pressure in the ground too.
In a minute, slide.
The outfields.
Get the jump right.
Play around the troll you have.
Then try to get it.
And stop at the...
Stop at the...
So it's not as much as...
Play with it.


====== REC010.txt ======
The player can run a rope that explains now what I'm going to say is dark climbing, I know.

You guys are cheap, but I know how to build my ideas best.
Demonstrate with a prototype, vertical size, it's all I can do.
Get your business set up, set it up an edge, and then if it's just well, hypothetically.
Make a Kickstarter, but by then have a steam store page and a commitment to be DRM-free
on all platforms.
Don't, don't give in that pick and don't make a big deal of money if they do rich out
to you.
Hmm, I don't know, I don't know if people, I can't be that mean, it's my project.

~~So here's the game plan, build the website, build the game, apply for any game fund or any~~
~~other means of income and then develop it further, get it more polished, or at this time~~
~~you should also have it each that I owe a page, get it more polished, and have it ready for~~
~~a Kickstarter campaign, websites, groups or this, work class and I bought it, but be careful, just~~
~~be careful, emulate, avoid how race funding and income to the friends, there's some others~~
~~there, but just like references, build your Kickstarter, put your website, yeah, Kickstarter, website,~~
~~if you have a page, same page, apply for any fund, when possible, when you have a playable game~~


====== REC019.txt ======
Okay, so what's the deal?
Take guys, give it a rainman.
You can make it personal, transparent, make it representative of a Saturn-like rain, whatever, you know.
Just put the gas around it.
On used gas.
So it looks like a Jupiter, really, but it's not the deepest, right?
Shallow gas.
You can do that.
The generator is pretty sluggish. Anyway, give it rain, keep it still in the axis.
Don't want to rotate, but then I have a rotating script, a circle around the axis, we're not.
Yeah, the axis of the torch ion, right?
Get it looking appropriate for the physics.
Make it look right, so it looks like a planet rotating you, that's not.
And then every scene you can change the rotation of the Sun plane for the rotation of the Sun.
Or under rain.
This is where we're going.
I don't think it's where we're going to rotate the light.
Well, under rain.


====== REC020.txt ======
So, essentially, I had to run to guys.
I haven't rotate around, but a lot of you access with rotation of guys.
So, it looks like it's rotating naturally like in real life.
Because I came with the scene, I'm going to simulate the extra space.
And then, because the sun can't move for real time, I'm going to have to load scenes to change sun's position.
But then, you've got to plan out the rotation of the sun.
Then, you can make a vertical orbit that simulates the orbit of guys.
No.
I have to be stationary.
Yeah, I have to be stationary, but let's hit the guys.
That's what I'll do.
That's what I'll do.
That way, I can get to the surface once now, hypothetically.
No.
It has to be independent.
It has to be slower.
Oh, okay.
Good.
So, we're going to take guys to the relative velocity or rotate the sun around a little velocity.
It needs independently.
That would be extremely year.
It's going to be an eight month.
That's guys take 30 days rotate.
Or have a big tune.
30 days rotate right guys.
Maybe an eight day for this thing.
I don't know.
I'm not sure anything about it.
Because it seems to rip it's already determined.


====== REC022.txt ======
This step is to place all our actors in key frame scenes using basic animation.


====== REC023.txt ======
This is a character and there's acting characters.
I think we have a good news for each model, which we'll face in a couple of seconds.
Or, I love how tough these are to me, actually.
Let's do it.
Oh, it's the stuff.
Not for the name of it.
Let's do it.

I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I like it too.


====== REC029.txt ======
at least right here, at least right here, okay, so we're going to take a look at the story
first, humanity is such a fellowship, these people have fallen theirs and I'm necessarily
the best and brightest because there are thousands of colony ships, maybe millions, depending
on how far transfer this is, but really the thousands that say it's not a huge thing, it's new,
it's never going to go, this is the first time, let's see.

So I took this egg in 3,000 years to reach this world, their capital ship, their
championship. That's kind of resources for the next voyage, and it's preparing to, here's
the sun as a means of propulsion. It's going to circle around it, it's going to sling shot
it in the direction used to go. But it's about to leave, chill, leave, see, we're back.
Do you see if that's taking place right now? It's a large event, people are celebrating, people
are saying goodbye. It's been a long journey and they're now ready to move on. The colony,
the colony is well off, it's well, it's demolished, it's stable, and that's all I need.
I think I'll start with the monitor. It could have taken a couple of years, a hundred years.
I'm going to take two deals, I'll break it all out, I will. Anyway, the player wakes, they're in the forest.
They take the form of the magician, robot.


====== REC034.txt ======
Okay
So we're going to demonstrate the scale of the city
The scale of the world all our just the player dust with the mountains
with
Mariana at their side
There's a small shop
Far from the city
So

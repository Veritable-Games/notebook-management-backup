====== REC047.txt ======
Philosophy, ethics, opinions, and the overall human expression, human experience is external to the Dodeck.


====== REC048.txt ======
Subjective as in internal thought processes and subjective as in non-objective.
One of the same are two different scenarios. Subjective thought and subjective opinion.
I guess that kind of makes sense, but subjective experience.
Oh boy.
That's probably a messy idea.


====== REC049.txt ======
subjective exchange and subjective information inside the brain and outside the mind.


====== REC050.txt ======
Experience is internal, expression is external, external being subjective, and internal being subjective.


====== REC051.txt ======
The Dodeck-Hedron is representative of the human mind and how it is
one by physical processes.
So interior to the Dodeck, interior to the Dodeck is
the brain, so to speak, and that is the experience, external to the Dodeck-Dodeck is


====== REC052.txt ======
Jodek is representative of universal systems, not just the mind, the brain, the physics
and of itself and technology and things we can objectively observe and make predictions for.


====== REC053.txt ======
technology be external to the dodeck.


====== REC054.txt ======
As tools, science, art, and philosophy are external to the Dodeck.
But as knowledge are these facets of human understanding interior to it.
If the Dodeck is representative of human mind.


====== REC055.txt ======
If behavior is represented by the face of a dodeck, exterior to that is knowledge, subjective
and objective, a web of information, like neurons in a brain.


====== REC056.txt ======
Okay, hopefully I can convey this in a few minutes.
I've got break.
So, let me think for a minute.


====== REC057.txt ======
Imagine a Dota Kedron floating in space.
The Dota Kedron is representative of the human body.
And all the points around it are his reality, his physics, his chemistry
and all of these variables act on the Dota Kedron.
And within the Dota Kedron is a collection of knowledge.
Objective information is beyond the Dota Kedron and subjective information is within it.


====== REC058.txt ======
but that still isn't work
that uh...
it's not a linear progression
of reality, it's more like a
more of a literal
kind of sense, it's like
even my looking out the universe
when in reality it's more like
it's not work
it's not work
it's not work
it's not work
it's not work
it's not work
it's not work
it's not work


====== REC059.txt ======
So imagine these extra points.
There these


====== REC060.txt ======
the beginning of the game. There is a dodeck. It's inverted though. The symbols are backwards
and it's black instead of white.
The player gets close to it, close to it,
they go into the threshold when they pop out. They're looking out into the world.
So imagine coming in the exterior of this web space.
This dark space I suppose is R. All the variables that affect the world.
The mind houses knowledge, the mind houses information, but then all those other variables.
The natural processes that act on the dodeck affect the interior and affect the internal behavior and external expression.
An eventually of philosophy and mathematics and further equipment we utilize to understand the world.
So again, I'll read it over time.


====== REC061.txt ======
You have space, and the space itself, all the variables, all the gravity and the weak force,
all the variables that act on us, and they collect as variables as a train of events,
sort of on to a little bit speaking, yes, but...


====== REC062.txt ======
So you have dark space, and it acts on, act, acts on an inverted Dota caedron.
All the symbols are backwards.
It's black instead of white.
There are many, shall I say, veins around it, smaller connections, and they all lead
to the exterior, or no, fuck, that's just too complex.
I'll have to represent information with the sides of Dota caedron.
The faces are the expressions and the sides are the information.
They are the regions at which space and mind connect.
Space, mind, expression, and a boy.
I'm going to need to visualize instead of speaking it.
Yeah, that's what I'll do.
This will be a personal goal, because I can't actually articulate this using words.
It's more of a abstract concept.
We are the...
Hang on.


====== REC063.txt ======
We experience the universe from sort of a inverse perspective because we are not separate
from the universe.
We are affected by the universe in and of itself.
The universe acts on us and we express outwardly into the universe.
Nothing around.
We don't act on the universe.
The universe acts on us.
We've got a little messed up.


====== REC064.txt ======
the center of the dodeck causes it to invert. The effect of this inversion is implied.
That way it's easier to navigate all the variables that affect human psyche, but then realize then that all the variables that affect human psyche are external to us.
When it flips, when it goes inverted.


====== REC065.txt ======
Objective is extrojective or being external. Subjective being internal. Objective being object generation.
Don't panic right. That's what I can do.


====== REC066.txt ======


====== REC067.txt ======
When the dodeck unfurls, this is when it goes beyond behavior into expression.
And then science blocks the mathematics.
You see connections being points connecting out and reaching under states.
More metaphorical than anything else.
That part is automatic.
The other bits are controlled by human interaction.
So like, clicking, finding points, having a rush forward, closer and closer.
And eventually, matching all patterns are going through the chain of events
to create the behavior scene.
Basic behavior is first and then more complex ones that are on.
Eventually, the control sides and the control sides use their main.
They kind of unfurls out in the universe.
The unfurls are once when all these connections are made up.
When they're all done, you see the sides of the dodeck headion glow.
Start to take shape.
But then when you're done making connections, the entire thing forms a complete dodeck headion
and then uninverts into normal shape.
And then reaches out into the expense.


====== REC068.txt ======
At the beginning of the game, you see the exterior of Ludota.
You see every distance, you see, you kind of move towards it, right?
And then eventually, you don't, uh, it uninverts, and then you go into it, and then see out.
Or no.
Ooh, interesting.
Okay.


====== REC069.txt ======
So the dodeck stays inverted.
You keep zooming in, zooming into these points and eventually you're in the center of the dodeck and the center of the dodeck is
experiential, that is
expression.
And then later in the game there are
let's say new connections being made from within the dodeck.
So like you're looking out
into
the void and you've got those connecting points again, but then on the far end you see
the symbols. They're backwards again.


====== REC070.txt ======
Try to do this in the engine if you can, save the dope excite for actual content, leave
this for intro and mean tree.


====== REC071.txt ======
You know, it kind of makes more sense.
Let's go with the first iteration there.
So, you're the universe, blah-bah.
You look in words, draw the dotac.
You see it.
You start pulling closer and closer.
You make connections.
It builds the lines fill up to make 3D shapes.
And the 2D shapes turn to 3D shapes.
And then it turns to a whole dotac-hedron.
And then it inverts and then branches out into the universe.
As we explore and learn, express.


====== REC072.txt ======
is anticipation and innate human trait.
Is it found in other animals or humans?


====== REC073.txt ======
anticipation, anticipation is equivalent to prediction.
Prediction is connected to curiosity.
Okay, interesting.
I've got actually a bubble dot actually.
I can start with connections like this.
I'll use the symbols instead of words.
I'll use, I'll connect the symbols to words to see if I'm missing anything.


====== REC074.txt ======
How do you attraction want some curiosity really?
Find biological links and extrapolate using the definitions and other potential connections.


====== REC075.txt ======
When the dodeck uninverts everything in an environment uninverts with it
Almost instantaneous
Oh no, gradually actually gradually to express the human knowledge is so very expensive


====== REC076.txt ======
We illuminate our surroundings by making points.


====== REC077.txt ======
To be more literal, the dodeck could.
You go into the dodeck and exit in third person with a symbol's back normal.
Or you can leave the player's perspective with the dodeck antenna focus.
To symbol the back of the neck, pick it up.

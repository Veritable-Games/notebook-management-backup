counterparts. Players act in the third-person view with a camera perspective that focuses on four things; the person

Players’ll3 use a uniquely-designed dialogue system to [talk to characters in a way

speech [dodecs4] instead of the long-winded expositions seen in traditional RPGs.

Developer Tips

•
If it’s been a while since a player has entered the game, give them an optional refresher tutorial.
When developing an update try to add a few hidden surprises to every update.
On a new game, ask the player to look up. Determine their look inversion settings.
In the menus A is used to advance, B is used to go back, and LB/RB are used for navigation.
Don't inform the player of auto saves. Just indicate it in bottom right hand corner of the screen.
Save settings when the player leaves the menus and not via those confirmation pop-ups.
Drip feed the player lore. The best stories aren’t afraid to let the player's imagination wander.
